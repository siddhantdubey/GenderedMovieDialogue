You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
I don't have to be home 'til two.
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
Is he oily or dry?
Great
Who?
No.
Just sent 'em through.
Never
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Just smack her now.
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
You're completely demented.
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
With the teeth of your zipper?
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
Absolutely not.
Your daughters went to the prom.
Have a great time, honey!
Dr. Ruth?
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
Tumescent!
What's a synonym for throbbing?
In the microwave.
Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
We should have seen land.
We'll all go crazy...
He's the devil's child...
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
Your life, and that of others!
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
You can see for yourself.
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
The Judgment is ours!
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
What is it, now?  Tell me...
I am busy inside.
They took everything...
They tried... but I didn't let them.
You don't usually ask.
That's something you can't decide.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
Thank God...
I find that hard to believe.
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
I know.
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
Viceroy of the West Indies.
My letters of appointment.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
May I ask by whom?
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
Father...
Not bad.
This time with me!
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
I want to go with you!
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
All I have to do is call the guards.
To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
You defend yourself admirably...
Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
Then you are too ambitious.
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
No?
You never learned how to speak my language.
You did the same to your God!
He understands.
Chief says...
Chief says -- he has a God.
Why?
Chief says -- how many?
Chief knows.
You come!  You speak first!
Island.  Far.
Say not here!  Cuba!
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
Do they have such thoughts?
How old are you, Senor Colon?
A woman?
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
That she was impregnable.
The ocean is uncrossable?
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
You will regret this.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
My horse doesn't work.
We don't need to know.
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
We can't be.
What's he doing?
Twenty eight.
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
God be with us admiral.
You tell that to them!
You bloody...
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
We're lost!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You must be mad...!
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
Immediately.
Because he is not afraid of me.
Then why?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
And who would you think of, for such a task?
He must be replaced.
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
... Into a monk...
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Oh.
There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
Okay.  But not water sports.
Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Who did cause and origin?
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
What was that, Korfin?
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
No.  I'm okay.
Stay with her.
Yeah.
Sorry...PD only.
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Takin' a bath.
What's he looking for?
You ready?
When?
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
No.
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
What's wrong?
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
Who's there?
Any chance we can do that again?
Okay.  You ready?
Ready?
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
That's unique.
So what's unique?
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
Jesus Christ.
Are you married?
And what do you do with the bones?
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
Hi, I'm Honey.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
How long are you planning to stay?
No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
How much money are you carrying with you?
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Next.  Could I see your documents, please?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
In here, says he wants a million.
This all you want?
New York's finest.  This is his case.
We started over, you can too.
It's easy to learn.
Yes, the money is good.
I can get you a job.
Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
We spent it!
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
Did you hurt her?
Emil???!
You want the tape?  There it is!
Viewer discretion advised!
Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
You've got a call.
What are you doing here?
Robert...?
Don't give me that fucking shit.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
Yeah?
In love?  With who?
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Isn't he a little moody?
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
I'm trying to tell you.
Well, he...
I know.
Excuse me?
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
What are you coming here to do?
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
Well, he killed my partner!
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
I'll take him.
What was that?
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
That's what it looks like to me.
No.  Go ahead.
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
I used an accelerant.
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
Don't stoop to his level!
What are you gonna do?
The clerk?
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Your doctor?
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
CONTINUED
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
CONTINUED
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
CONTINUED
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
CONTINUED
She's wonderful.
CONTINUED
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
CONTINUED
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE

Goodbye, Daddy.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Yes, Daddy.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Thank you, Daddy.
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
How many days until you come home?
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
She's in the bathroom.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
In three days, darling, I hope.
When are you coming home?
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
Are you coming to my party?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
I'm having a party tomorrow.
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
I'll bet it's a fortune.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Well, how's it going back there?
Thank you.
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
Well, that does sound very odd.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Well, where are all of you off to?
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
How is gregor?
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
And your charming little daughter?
Yes, it's coming along very well.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Fine.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Yes, very pleasant.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
Certainly.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
Well, I'm glad about that.
Fortunately, they did.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
I see.
That's right.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
Really?
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Yes, really, thank you very much.
Are you quite sure?
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
Any ideas about the colour?
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
Any clue as to what it is?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
I see.
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
What do you mean?
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
Thank you.
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
When do we arrive at Clavius?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
Great, just great.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
How about chargin' the battery?
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
Yeah, I've been busy.
This is three years old.
Hammond.
Name?
I want to pick up my car.
Yeah?
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Yeah.
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
Hey, what about me?
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
I never paid for it in my life.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
Pay money?
Pros.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
I ain't tired yet.
I want to drive awhile.
You got a real big mouth, convict.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Hello, again.
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
What's the matter with my place?
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
You're in a hurry.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
I'm candy...
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
No chance.
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
Would you guys...
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
What a screw-up.
You couldn't get to him?
Which one pulled the trigger?
How did they get away?
What the bell happened?
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
Jack?
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
Yeah, I read the report...
I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
That's what you say, Cates...
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
I'm heading out. How about you?
Nothing.
Doesn't look like it.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
You look awful.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
I don't know.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
Who gives a fuck what you think?
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
A cop...
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
Keep stallin'.
What do you want?
Stall.
Shut up.
What do you want?  What's goin' on?
What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
Shut up.
Hey...
Sure, right.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
Yeah, old times.
We got a lot to talk about.
Can't complain.
How ya doin'?
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
How hot are they?
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
Rosalie, you okay?
First, the money.
Let her go.
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
You chickenshit punk...
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
When?
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
Surprise, Luther.
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
Give it back.
This ain't a credit business.
Five bills.
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
You sure?
You want to go outside?
Not bad, not bad.
I know...
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
...would you like a drink?
Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
Why?  What's wrong with me?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
I'm fucked!
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
Is there anything that can stop it?
And then?
That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
One more reason to shoot first eh?
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
They really made her...
I didn't know your size.
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
What's she doing?
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
What is?
They are... with me...
I would like to have died in peace...
I don't have time... I need to know.
Do you love her?
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
So, just how big was this fare?
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
In your dreams! See you tonight!
How many points you got left on your license?
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
How do I look?
Don't exist bud.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
Hey bud! Finger here.
...Leeloo.
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.

Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
We will be ready, Lord.
When EVIL returns so shall we.
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
Take them and put them in a safe place.
The Fifth Element...
Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
You little sleaze bag!
Have you pulled yourself together?
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
6... 5...
30 seconds...
This is a police control action..
You have nine points left on your license..
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
You know how to fly this thing?
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
He's on vacation.
Got it...
I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
Crystal.
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
Does it get any better or what!
Three of us will never fit in there!
I thought you were divorced.
What is it?
Why not?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
Don't you open your messages?
You're the only one left alive...
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
To save the world.
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: "It never rain every day." This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
Not going to open?
Thanks..
It's not?
Uh..
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
The cash man!
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
An elephant couldn't crack it.
This thing solid?
Wonderful!
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Talk English Doc.
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Have you identified it?
Actually only one cell survived..
This is all that survived?
How much time is left?
They just landed in the desert.
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
I want your best man on this!
...What do you mean?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
I'm about to, Mr. President.
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
Gentlemen?
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Recommendations.
Wait or act.
Options.
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Perfect, Mr. President.
Is that better?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Staedert, do you read me?
To fame.. salud..
Drink!
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
Only too well... here you must be parched..
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
Amen..
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
I'm not at the hotel!
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Yes, Sir!
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
...I can't wait to be among you.
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
How's our deal coming along?
Got it.
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
...Not far, now.
No... not at all.  Where are you?
Am I disturbing you?
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
What you see is what I got, mister.
There's nothing harder.
Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
I promised him to Machine.
Nobody knows anything.
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
Bullshit.
What are you talking about?
What do you want?
It's good what you're doing.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
I'm not so sure about this.
Why don't they come to me?
We do.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
Alright, Tom.
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
Those are her belongings.
Do you know what happened to her?
Yes.  I remember her.
Yes... I remember Mary
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
None too discreet, is he?
Certainly, sir.
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
Okay.  Fine.
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Then we'll stay up together.
We'll figure it out.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
Yeah, or turn you into toast.
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
You alright?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
Alice, you think you can leave?
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
Sounds like a game show host to me.
You could do worse.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
That obvious, huh?
What?
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
Enough of that crap.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
Alright, I think I see salvation...
What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
Been up with Alice.
She knew she was gonna die.
Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
Let me talk to you.
Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
Earth to Alice...
Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
I'm sorry honey, but...
Your distraught.  It'll help...
What's wrong with me?
You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Something the matter with the cuisine?
I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
I'll tell you later.
It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
Oh God!  He killed them!
What is it?
When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
What?
Avoid-all-contact-day.
Something wrong with the stairs?
Don't worry, honey
You don't get it, he's after me...
You just stay put.  You need rest.
I gotta get out of here.
You had a nasty bump.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
Feeling better now?
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
And ours.  It's our grandchild.
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
Excuse us, dear.
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
He's inside you, where he hides.
Mommy...?
My friend, with the funny hand.
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
She doesn't want me around
No...
Been having bad dreams.
I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
It's lonely in there, in my room.
Hey...wake up.
There you go.  Love you.
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
About him?
He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
Sorry, babe.
Hi, beautiful.
Now.
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
Alice!
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
Since my little girl became a mom...
Alice...
Sobering...
I'm so sorry, honey...
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
Where are we going?
It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
No.  A deal's a deal.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Who?
You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
I want to talk about the baby.
Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
Yeah...
These things are wild...  What do you think?
We hope!
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
Right at our one-eyed friend!
What???
Course and speed?
What about down?
Is there any way out of it?
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
What????
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
Why do you say that?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
Something wrong?
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
Yes, Griff?
Excuse me, Skipper---
What about time...?
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
Anything ---
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
Radiation level...constantly rising...
Now they feel it...down below.
That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
Wonderful!
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
All ready?
There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
There's got to be an explanation!
As we near the Pole...
What direction does the system indicate?
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
Under <u>water</u>?
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Nothing we can do, now.
What?
And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
We can <u>ram</u> him!
That's what I said!
What's the running time?
Take a look.
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
What do you think?
Huh?
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
Obviously.
Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
Your friend was to remain where he was!
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
All right - go to it.
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
Toward the Pole!
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
I'll be another!
Well, I'll be - !
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
See what?
Thank you.
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
Chub says you're fired.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
Same old shit.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
How soon?
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
See. Get your boots.
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
Where's Jill?
I still don't understand --
Good. Who?
Did you get his number?
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
It makes me sad.
Is...? She's dead then?
Coffee's perked.
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
There's a furnace.
You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Hold on!
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
What the hell are you talking about?
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
Can't it wait, then?
Something about my father?
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Who are you?
No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
The other guy.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
You talked to Jack?
Marg! You got orders!
Marg!
This town sucks.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
What?
Take care, Wade.
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Bang!
Everything you know is from me.
Love! I'm made of love!
Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
In the living room.
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
She's coming.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
Sleeping.
You no-good pup!
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!
Atta-go.
A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
Jim... for godsake!
Daddy. Daddy, please...
I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
Yes dear?
Mom?
Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
That's not really the point.
Some kids were teasing you?
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
Your father never means to be so...
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
I'm sorry, honey.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
Back at The Fishbowl?
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
Alice...
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
Don't you even want to ask?
I'm sure he's busy.
You don't want to say hi to your father?
Yeah, no duh.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
You are a resilient man, Mr.
He didn't leave us.
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
I don't drink coffee.
There they are!
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
Been better, Dad... You?
Daddy...
Daddy...
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Oooooh, I'm good.
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
Did we warn them off?
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
Lemme take a look.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
Stay cool.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Put your pilot on.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
I prefered the terrorists.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
This doesn't make sense.
They aren't answering their hails.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
We don't know that.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
Sir, you threw out page two.
To swear you in as President.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
But they start executing hostages in
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
Can we do that?
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
My loyalty was never to my country.
Because it is my duty.
Yes, Mr. President.
Ga get it.
That's affirmative.
Roger.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
About goddamn time.
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Where are we now?
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
We're not going to make it.
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
How?
Well it worked.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
why did they do that?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
A secret service agent. It must be.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Who did this?
Any of us?
Nine.
How many others killed?
Dead.
The rest of the secret service?
Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
We've already been inspected.
Copy, Air Force One.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Tower, here.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
Stand by.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
You're pointing a gun at me.
Scared. We're scared.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
*                     Please tell me your name.
Thank you.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
And all these rooms here?
I guess it depends on your perspective.
A dubious distinction, no?
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
Three...
Jim...
Four...
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Say something dear.
No.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
That was war.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
How can you? I mean they're people.
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
Yes
Do you have to be so brutal?
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
My husband is a very courageous man.
I know he left you behind.
What do you know of my husband?
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
Leave my daughter alone.
Come on, Alice.
Now, or he dies, please.
Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.
What do you want with us?
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
There goes your ride.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
Good. Good.
You'll do it?
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
Finally, we can bargain.
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
Twenty minutes?
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
Sir, we stay with the President.
Yes, sir.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
Gravity.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
What are you doing?
Both of you.
I don't know why you stayed.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
How did your speech go?
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
What?
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
No, Mr. President.  It can't.
May I speak to you for a moment?
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Where are we sending it?
No. I thought about this, Mr.
The fax machines.
The fax machines.
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
But this is different, sir. You're the President.
and if that means negotiating...
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
Two... THREE. GO!
One.
We're handling it, sir.
We're under attack.
Thank you for calling the white House...
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Yeah, right.
who can I say is calling?
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
Commissioner, Aquarius.
Kruger, Sagittarius.
I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
What's the story?
I was reading too.
Forget it.  I was reading.
You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
That just doesn't make any sense.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
I just wish it was that simple.
What?
Commissioner.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
What is it, Mary?
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
Felt like a large asteroid.
Yes I did...
Did you feel that?
You better take this.
Sir?
Dunn.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
You better check it, Unger.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
Accelerators down.
Shut down accelerators.
Dunn.
Oveur.
Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
Roger.
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
You have great tits.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
Negative.
Negative.
Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
Yeah.
He's a boy dog.
Sure.
Can I hold him?
Scraps.
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
What...?
All right.  Here.
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
I don't want to hear that word!
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
You're sure?
What?
I don't want to live anymore.
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
Poached!  Not over!  Over!
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
Just poached on toast.  Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
No.  Poached.  Over.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
What should I say?
A b...
Sixteen 'C', why?
Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Yes.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
You folks need any help?
But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
You can't go in there!
Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
No.  I mean your relationship.
Do you want to talk about it.
No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
You've been hurt.
You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
No. I'm all alone.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
Thank you. Cream?
Ah, won't you sit down?
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
Something about a plane with no pilot?
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
Well...not for another two hours.
Can't you take a guess?
I can't tell.
Captain, how soon can we land?
I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
What did he have?
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
Yes. Yes, of course.
That's right.
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
Airsick?
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
Hello.
Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Good-bye, darling.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
Good-bye, darling.
Every day.
You promise you'll write.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
He's right on the heading.
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Yes, Captain?
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Here.
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
How ya doing, honey?
What is it?
Oh, I can't stand it.
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
Okay, this is one of my favorites.
Oh, I'd love to.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
I'm Randy.
Hi!
Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Yes?
I will, but Jim won't.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
No, why don't you take care ot it?
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
We have clearance, Clarence.
Huh?
Roger.
Huh?
Roger.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Of course.
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Yes?
Excuse me, Sister?
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
Would you go up, please?
It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
Do you feel all right, sir?
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
Yeah...
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
A virgin.  I find that very arousing...
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
In there.
She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.
He's not here.  Why ask me?
Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
That's right.
I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
Yes...
Do it!
Here?
Kill them both.
This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
He didn't recognize me.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
You think this is the guy who did it?
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
Sure.  Just a minute.
I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.
For you, anything.
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
Ss'kya'ta'.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
Don't tell me what to think.
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
You?
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
Yeah, Sykes?
I can't!  Do you mind!
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
Whatever gave you that idea?
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
It is.
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
Talk to me, Hudson.
Can't lock up...
Position?
Movement!
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Would you, Sir?
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
This floor's freezing.
Say again?  All after incinerators?
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Okay, let's do it.
Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
Dead on all channels.
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
I told them to fall back...
Shut up.  Just shut up!
So?  So?
So.
Proceed inside.
What is it?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
Thirty-eight...simulated.
You tell me.  I only work here.
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
Alive?
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
...We're coming in.
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
What's the question?
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
Yes, Hicks?
Sir?
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
Let's go!  Let's go!
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
Seventeen meters.
Do it!
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
Aye-firmative.
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Sure, Hicks.
No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
You're just reading me.
It's inside the complex.
Hudson, give us a break.
Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!
Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.
Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
Anytime.  Anywhere.
Fuck you.
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
No.  Have you?
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
It's readin' right.  Look!
Nine meters.  Eight.
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
Fifteen meters.
Range twenty meters.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
Uh, what's next?
Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
So what do I tell this guy?
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
Yeah.  What?
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
And how are we today?
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.

His Grace is very angry with you.
Indeed.
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
You have leave to try.
And how will you make him keep it?
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
Hardly.
No! I won't have him back.
Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
What are you talking about?
Why?
Now?
Where?
What is it?
Behold!
Behold!
Hey!
Hey!
Behold!
Behold!
Adorable!
He's adorable!
Be careful!
Be careful!
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
Yes. He is a little strange.
What a strange young man.
Michael!
I said play!
Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
Gertrude!
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
You can't be Herr Mozart!
Gertrude!
Upstairs.
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
Just one year.
Wine?
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
Ah, now! Here she comes.
He's here.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Yes, sir.
In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
My answer is no, Mozart.
I'm sorry. No.
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
What for?
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow.  Hannah! Come this way.
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
Taking out what you should never have put in.
It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
Exactly. A dance.
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
That will do, Herr Mozart!
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
You mean in Turkey?
I think you'd better.
Oh? Have I seen it?
Herr Mozart -
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Mozart -
Mozart -
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
On the contrary.
Because His Majesty wishes it.
What is what?
Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
Mozart -
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Ballet? What ballet?
What anger?
The Emperor has given him permission.
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Where?
Are you absolutely sure?
You must be mad.
He's setting that play to music?
You mean that play?
Italian?
Yes?
Ah.
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
Did we?
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
Well done, Sire!
Bravo, Your Majesty!
Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
What do you mean - now?
Well, promise then.
I can't wait.
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
What? Who the devil are you?
Here I am, my angel.
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
That lady is back, sir.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
The American? Yes, duck.
No.
No!
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
I looked.
I think he's a Jew.
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
He all right?
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Miss Price.
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
Now see here young man.
There's no call for that kind of language.
All right, you two, move along.
You did, did you?
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
You could have told them!
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
That's very funny, that is.
Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.
No. You've had your chance.
Oh, come on, tell us.
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
No, but we're about to.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
Bambi?
Some, everyone does.
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
No, thank you, Doctor.
Dr. Hirsch?
He's on the telephone.
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
Sorry, love.
Hello, there. What can I get you?
I beg your pardon?
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
No.
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
No.
We'll find him, not to worry.
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.
That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
I don't rightly know, sir.
And what, Sergeant?
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
Sorry.
I'd like some tea, please.
No, thank you.
Yes - sure
Why not?
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
But listen, Tom, I
Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest
I want to know why .
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
Hello, Tom.
Yeah.
He has?
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
Matt?
Where's Matt?
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
No kidding?
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
Oscar, what's the matter?
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
Yeah.
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
Whose death?
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
Yeah?
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
About twenty-four thousand.
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
Take it easy, Clark.
What good will that do?
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
All right, Jack, all right.
It's one of the boys from headquarters. He always sings "Mother Machree" whenever he's got good news. Looks like this case'll be settled in no time.
Thanks.
Why, of course.
Oh!
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
You don't have to do nothing.
Why not?
We can take blood from anything   If it's comin' to us.
That don't do us any good.
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
Shall we let the people come in?
Thank you!
I'm feeling fine this morning.
Excuse me
Much better this morning, thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Yes?
Mr. Sampson . . .
Yes, sir.
Yes?
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
Mr. Dickson?
Yes, thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Why, I don't know.
No, sir.
I haven't any.
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
Of course it's true - and he knows it.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
If he can do it, yes.
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
What'll we do?
Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
Yes, sir.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
Yes, sir.
We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors.
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
The lobby's half filled now.
Yes, sir.
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
It's his life insurance money, you know.
Absolutely.
Is it safe?
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
Are you sure?
He was here?
Yes, why?
Yes, sir.
Dude Finlay?
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
What did you find out, Mike?
That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.
Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it
There you are!
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
No. It wasn't earlier because...
It couldn't have been earlier?
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
Was it twelve o'clock?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after
What time did Matt Brown get in?
Huh?
What time was it?
It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
for the rheumatism, you know.
Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
Then where were you?
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
What time did you get in?
So you were home last night?
Then who changed it?
You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
I guess so.
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
I'm okay, Matt.
Okay, Matt.
Sometimes a wound will kill.
I couldn't lose him.
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
You shut up now, boy.
How?
What you sayin' boy?
What?
I'm thinking...
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
You ride like a Comanche.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
Where is Jesse James?
Of course!  Uh, sir?
Me get heap firewater --
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
Ho-yah!
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
Of St. Louis?
The District Marshall
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
You 'um big lawman?
I'd appreciate that.
Fine. I'll just wait here.
It's a secret.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
On account of we're robbing it.
Then why can't I go in there?
You're right, sir.
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Shit.
I had you covered.  From back there.
Where the hell were you?
When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
So?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
What is it?
What the --
It's fine by me, Jesse.
You know you're welcome any time!
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
Boys...
Web died fighting?
My little Web did that?
I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
They're gone. What are you --
The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
How much of that story is true?
Uncle Frank?
So what was he?
But he killed a lot of men, too.
They're making him a hero now.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
Shush.
Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
Riders --
Boys?
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
We're just fine, thank you, sir.
He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
Say your prayers?
Did you kill Yankees?
Communion.
Now let's have a drink.
Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
... too young for whisky...
It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
Well, not exactly.
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
You okay, Jesse?
I like that.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
Don't talk about it much, though.
Really?
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
That is so gentlemanly of you.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Lyla Devereux.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
I just though you were awful cute.
Not at all.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Really?
Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Why, yeah.
This is nicer than your other apartment.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Alright.
I don't think so.
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
You just haven't been looking.
Listen, what about dinner?
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Because he dated her.
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
Good coloring.
What are the rules for a sweater vest?
Don't come back.
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
I think you should go now.
There was no ad in the Times.
You saw the ad in the Times?
No, he doesn't.
Can I help you?
Are you my two o'clock?
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
It's just not.
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
Excuse me. I really must he going.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
The message you left.
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
Patrick?
Where are you going?
Call me please, Patrick.
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
Patrick? Is that you?
It looks so soft.
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
This.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
What's that, a gram?
Like what?
I guess you're right...  THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!
SHUT UP!
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
That's Paul Owen.
It looks that way, doesn't it?
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
I said we are totally booked.
We are totally booked.
Dorsia, yes?
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
Dorsia.
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
Well...
A model? An actor?
So, what do you do?
Okay. Do.
Yeah.
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
Is that a raincoat?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
Hey, Halberstam?
They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
Yeah, well, you're late.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so... out of it. So...undangerous.
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
You think so?
I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --
You don't wanna move, do you?
I'm just screwed.
You know what I mean.
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
'Gonna wait outside.
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
He wasn't acting?
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
That'll be a test, won't it?
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
And Outpost? You're happy there?
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
My goodness.
Milo?
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
Have a seat.
Milo?
Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Like I said: shot in the dark.
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
...When did you know?
What?!
Is it your software?
You're interfaced with our dish.
What?!
Okay.
What?
Will I get to work for Outpost?
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up.
We tried!
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
Outpost doesn't own em.
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
That's gotta kill him, right?
I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.
We could move 'em up here.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
Milo? I'm Danny.
Gary?
What?
Longitude 109 --
Ready for number three?
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
Gary, don't worry, we --
Hasn't affected his work, though.
There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
...You wanna work -- here?
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
I mean, it's your life.
I think you should go.
In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
Where we going?
Come with me.
I'm calling Gary.
You calling Phil and Randy?
They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?
Let's get him in here.
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
Any irregularity in the pattern.
What're we looking for?
Keep looking.
Every entry was authorized.
Not yet. 'Love to bust my ass cause I'm not in frigging Mensa.  I swear to God, it's that kid Milo, I told 'em so in the first place, but they didn't even wanna hear about it.  Let's run a printout on card entries.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
Did you tell Alice?
What? Come on. Is it serious?
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
Uh. Not exactly.
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
Right. That's rare around here. You know how nuns' re-married to Jesus? 'Posties are married to Outpost.
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.
Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big...  'Guess he needs to micro-manage something.
So how'd you like the house?
Oh we're not going to the campus.
You don't look anything like a three- year-old.
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
Yeah, yeah.
Speaking of which...
Maybe he'll get back to work.
There is no public offering. The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this just to run their web site.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in?
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
We're too late. Take a look.
Where is he?
Who're these guys?
You're not listening.
I could get it out of him.
That kid's the great white hope.
Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
What is it?
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
Hungry.
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
Groovy!
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Love is... love is... love is...
That does not compute.
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
One book: Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me: This Sort of Thing Is My Bag, Baby, by Austin Powers.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
Danger Powers, personal effects.
Noooooooooooooo!
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
Here, have a piece of gum.
Hey, wait a minute--
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
Commander, I have to log it...
What's its current position?
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Shut up.
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Oh my God, he's back.
It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
What are you saying, son?
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
Is it one of ours?
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--
Ow! You shot me!
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
Please allow me to demonstrate.
They're mutated sea bass.
Sea bass.
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
Dr. Evil?
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
Yes.  Scott!
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
Umm, that also has already happened.
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
I love you, Vanessa.
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
Of course not. I was married to your father.
Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
I'm proud of you.
You didn't...
How's Austin?
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
Scott.
We don't label people here, Scott.
What do you want to do, Scott?
And how do you feel about that?
We don't judge here.
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
Really?
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
Three days.

I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
There, look!
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
You mean you don't recall??
You
Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Then you can't come in.
You are female?
I'm afraid that's impossible.
May I help you, madam ...
You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
People, too.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
We have met ...
If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
Eh? In here!
And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive.  He tells me you're very beautiful.
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Steed
We want Mrs. Peel.
So you say ...
Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
This way ...
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
You with Mother or Father?
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
Are you alright, young man?
Stay by the window. By the window.
Let it be rain, please let it be --
Walk over to the window ...
No, please! I beg you ...
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
Mrs. Peel -- ?
Check out the other guy's buns.
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
Really -- you went with him for two years.
Does Cole know about this?
...Really?
Debbie's marrying Rick.
What's happening?
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
That's what we're going to find out...
Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em.
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
Women!
Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
You're kidding.
Yeah. What is it?
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
Hey, man, congratulations!
Man, you're losing your audience.
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
When do the girls get to the party?
All right!
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
Fine. How's everything going?
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Hello?
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
Keep me informed.
If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed...  ...I'd take more persuasive action.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Nice shot.
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
I know what I'm doing... Go!
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
I hope Ilene's all right.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
A strange wang right in my palm.
You know your father enjoys his company.
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
Any time, Al.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
I think I screwed that one once.
Great bathing suit.
Well... hope she'll be very happy.
A real turd.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
That's more like it.
Give him the works.
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
Why?
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
What are you...
That's it, prick lips.
Screw you!
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
Your whores never showed up.
What are you talking about, asshole?
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
Okay. Nice to meet you both.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
Let's see your bread.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
Yes.
Screw that.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
What's going on?
Let's have a toast.
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
Let's go.
Screw you...
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
Milt?
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
I'll take some.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
I want women.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
You're a pimp?
What can I be doing for you?
That's it.
I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
It's Bullwinkle.
Ha, ha, ha.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
Yeah, I guess so.
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
I just want to be alone.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
Right.
You want to share it?
You're all under arrest. Open up!
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
It's on the tenth floor.
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
No sob story is going to change my mind.
Rick!
First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
All right, who serves?
It's all right...  So have I.
No, Brett, I...
You've been having strange sex...!
The phone made me do it!
Ed... you're kinky!
You can tell a man by his friends.
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
No. Let's at least finish the set.
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
Of course.
I'm separated.
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
You're late again, Rick.
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
I don't know.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
Stevie... I...
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
Biggest in two battalions.
Yeah...
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
Wash it to the windows?
Oh these moments do try me...
-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
-- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!
You gotta let me finish --
That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
He's alive.
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did you see him burn?
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
Sure you do.
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
It isn't mine.  Let's get a picture.
Mr. McCaffrey...
Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
No need to be modest, Brian.
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Aren't you even curious?
What the hell are we waiting for?
You know, I've got a perfect little spot here for "Brian McCaffrey, Fireman"...
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.
You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?
Cute.
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.
Well, let's have a look.
Who's going to die?
They're waitin' man.
We gotta roll, Stevie...
He just wants to --
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
That's your job.
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
Anyway, down here, take a look...
There's something else kinda interesting...
They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
-- Burn it all.
-- Burn them.
-- Burn them.
Absolutely.
Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
Did he tell you how we finally met?
Tell him about me, Shadow?
I know you.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
Who's this?
Didn't think you'd make it.
Shadow.
I'm a little busy right now --
Investigator...
Just catch the son of a bitch.
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
Don't you have any leads at all?
When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
Inspector.
Investigator Rimgale.
That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo brought it in,  You don't want to hurt those boys, do you? I mean, they sure as Hell have got something coming, but it ain't what the Law wants to give them. You understand?  No. How could you understand.
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
So what are you doing here?
I was gonna bring it back myself.
Are you all right, honey?
Yes.
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
Yes.
You took the chalice.
I know.  Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool.
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
How are you doing, man?
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it?
Oh, really?
Let me think about it.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
All right, cop. I want my money.
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina.
Yes, Sister?
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
You truly are a dancing fool.
Did he gots to be.
He gots to be did.
1/16, tru' 'dat.  True 'dat.
We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!
...that simpleton is holding back the race.  They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
...Benedict Arnold...
I'm on it.
Keep trying.
B-L-A-K it is.
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
How 'bout...
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
Louder.  They can't hear you.
Let's go niggers!
Let's go NIGGERS.
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
YEAH!
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
I'm gonna start a chant and I want y'all to follow me.  Let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show.
Yeah!
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?
That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout! That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout!  I want to be the first to welcome you to the second taping of Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show.
Ho!
Everybody say Ho!
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
C'mon, why not?  The Monkees had a show.  Look at all that other junk that's on TV.  We got underground cult following.
Yeah, him.
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
Give me some?
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
We gonna drop some knowledge, wisdom and understanding.  The Mau- Mau's, we be scientists.  We drop science.
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.
And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
I'm a revolutionary.
What do you do?
What do I do?
And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout.
Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head.
I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you.  You think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I quit.
You can walk away.  We both can.
You're in this up till ya neck.
So that's what you been doing?
I'm out.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Look at my lips.
In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
Please, have a seat.
What's wrong with him?
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
She's also moorish.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
Why are you smiling so?
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
Nice to meet you.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
What kind of show is this gonna be?
How much?
Manray needs a job.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
That ain't funny.
We're starving.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
We was coming to see you.
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
I'm tired of waiting.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
And I'm the feet.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
Ahh, the luxuries of life.
Did we get our bill yet?
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
I won't do it anymore.
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
Mantan?
Why?
Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
To what?
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
How different?
Where do I sign?
What do I have to do?
My tap shoes.
Well do something about it.
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
But the line has to be drawn.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?
He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
Your father is proud of you.
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN."
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
He, I'm Mona.
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team.
Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
What's a Negro.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
I just turned twenty.
This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
Thank you.  And always smile.
The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.
The best defense is offense.
First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
You sing and dance?
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
I never had a really real pair before.
I admit, that's a very hard thing to do.  Quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors, DA BOMB.  125% PURE PLEASURE MALT LIQUOR.  IT MAKES YOU WANNA GET YA FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER. 125% AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS.
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
Money and nothing else?
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
Where are you bound for?
Good day to you, young sir.
Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
Both of us ride home with Best here.
If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
I never was more in earnest.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?
Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud.
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
I have heard of them.
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.  Good night.
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
I don't know.
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
As you please.
Your honor must lower his voice.
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
You are going to drive to the frontier.
I will let down the steps for your honor.
Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
Then you yield to me.
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes --
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
Why are you shaking?
Then you must get it.
Agreed.
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
All the same, you must name an amount.
As much as possible?
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you.
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
Then this must be done tomorrow.
The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
Hmm-mmmm.
Was he cheated?
Does this assignment interest you?
You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him "good luck."
When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in Birchin Lane, London.  I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been treated here.
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
May I be quite frank with you?
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
Is he all right, papa?
Yes, papa.
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Papa?
Good night, papa.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Did you buy the horse, papa?
I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
He wants to step into my shoes!  He wants to step into my shoes!
Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me?  A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  My wife never comes near me.  What friend have I?  None in the wide world.  Men of the world, as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.
Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
He loves me, as I love you.
He is only curious to know who you are.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
Who?
Hurricane kept you up, too?
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
He is the only one unaccounted for.
Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
Fine.
Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
Just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? I'll take care of this.
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
Shut up, Mueller.
West was one thing, but this --
HEY!
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
I don't know!
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
You killed him you fucking faggot --
We found him like this --
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
Can anybody hear me!
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
Yeah, right...
We found him like this...
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
We don't know. West is dead.
What the fuck is going on?
The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Cadet, what's your name!
I...
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
Jesus, what happened?
Why?
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
I was freezing from the hurricane --
I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
Pike and I got separated --
You better watch it, faggot, I'm not sure you and Childs didn't do him --
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
The faggot speaks.
Tell him to shut up --
Shut up!
Bullshit --
The fuck are you talking about --
We're not going anywhere.
I used it to start the fire --
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
What the fuck are you doing?
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
Terrible tragedy. One of those Section Eight boys worked in here. Pike. Heard he got out okay.
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as follows -- Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs!
Sir, yes, sir!
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military -- you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
Sir, yes, sir!
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
You won't find a better place!
No one's ever left.
Why?
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
Not yet.
Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
Bloom like a flower?
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
Bloom!
Let's see it.
You get the eye?
Fine, you do it.
Then do it.
Or are you too scared?
Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And that's the real story of how you were born.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
Thirty years. Maybe more.
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
A pleasure.
Will.
You're not trying to run away?
You know anyone's who's taken it?
What did she say?
Okay.
You don't like it?
Karl.
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
I can.
Really?
Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
This is it? The whole vault.
I'm robbing this place.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
It's me. Norther Winslow.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
This is why you don't show work in progress.
There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
There is no softer ground than town.
The sets were good.
Yeah it was okay.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
Such as?
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
You know what for.
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me 150.
You first.
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
What? What are you doing?
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
What?
Thank you.
Yeah.
That's not a burn.
What's this?
We'll stop then.
Do you want to stop?
What do you mean?
There's over eighty thousand here.
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
You can see why it's sensitive?
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
How do you want to pay?
You have excellent English.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Don't gotta tell me. Me and my girlfriends use-ta talk 'bout them hard fingertips he got pickin' that guitar.
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
You seen my snake-skin shoes?
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
He black alright, he just ain't blue.
Can I put it in your mouth?
No, ma'am.
Hey.
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
Well, that makes it easier.
And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
Better?
Here. Pound this and I'll join you.
You wanna go home?
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.
Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
I skipped lunch.
Yes'sir.
Please don't tell my daddy.
Why she got a chain on her?
Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
Yes'sir.
You won't at the square this mornin'.
Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
The hell are you talkin' about?
All that shit's on aisle 5.
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
You need money again?
Yeah.
What happened to your face?
I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?
What does Charlie mean?
Cool?
That I should let you pay for the drinks.  Kampai.
Joyce can be nice.
Squid?
I wasn't expecting you.
If you give me one.
You'll take care of that.
All right, how's the new partner?
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
How can you be so sure?
Think we'll get him, Nick?
Louder, pal, louder.
Yes...
Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla.
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
Luck.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.  You have one?
Someone attacked him.
I don't know.
I couldn't tell.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
Kampai.
I can't...
No.
Nick, you can't do this.
No...
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick.  No.  I won't put myself in danger for you anymore.
It's illegal, Nick.
It's very small.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
What...?  Why?
A resort city, Beppu.
Nick!
San is an honorable title.
Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san.
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
Nick --
I'm not drunk...
You can trust me.
I'll check it out.
You can't come in.  They don't want --
You were too far behind.
Yakuza.
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Nick...
Sure.
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
There she is!
Nick...
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
I stole them.
I've continued working on the case!
I'll get him for you, Nick.
You must leave?
I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
I don't, that's all.
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
Nick!
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
"Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
Where would you look for the mafia?
Then take it from him.
Don't be.
This is my stop.
She's such a long way home for you.
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.
You are a lucky man.  Where you come from a man can stand out.  It's expected.  Here a man is made to look a fool for standing out.
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
Keep the change.
... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.
Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it. That's orders.  Period.
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
It's not your job.
They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective.
One guy do all the damage?
The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental car were full of it.
Dope?
How big a package we talking about?
You want him dead too.
He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
I'll pay you.
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them.
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
He'll be dealt with.
I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.
-- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of my partners.  One in New York, one at the printing plant.
Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
Then go get him.
Not to be trapped.
Anywhere.
Let's go while there is still time.
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
If he won't cooperate?
You certainly have a nice place here.
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
Also extraordinary things.
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.
Come here.
I'm afraid that's a little out of my...
What's the problem?
Would you like to be modified?
And what can he do for you?
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
Oh?
Go.
If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?
Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred.  The cat is about to get out of the bag.  Pressure is definitely on.  The Nexus program is terminated.  When you finish there, locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire.
Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.
She's not with you?
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
You didn't like her!?
Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
Industrial refuse.
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
Oh!  Day after tomorrow.
When might that be?
Well, when do you get paid?
Your customer, eh?
Nexus designated Zhora:  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
Longevity is classified.  No.
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...
And what in your estimation works?
Do you have something against science?
What about a summary then.
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
Why, yes, of course.
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
How old am I?
One more, eh?
I like you.
You like to kiss her goodbye.
Prosit.
Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
Ya.
No problem.
You want to see my friends?
Prosit.
Thank you very much.
Vodka!
But I would like to buy you drink.
I think I have no money.
I know what they are, Deck -- Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way.
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.
I'm taking a piss.
Let's hear it.
Money?
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?
My job is here.
Too old.
You sure?
What if you change your mind?
You're going to be over the limit.
But you haven't put in for emigration.
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
During the road test...
Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
Nerves of steel.
Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
Who?
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
Of course.
Yes?
And who do I go to about you?
I bet I would.
Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck mine, huh?
Jeezus!
Come on.
The best.
You mean the snake.
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
What the fuck for?
Are you for real?
How do you mean 'exploited'?
I don't know nothing about it.
Yeah?
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Holden got hit.
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
Where the hell you been?
All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper 231 -- I believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced.
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.
How many questions did it take?
The machine works.  She is.
Well?
Sitting next to you.
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
But in your profession that is a risk.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
May I ask a personal question?
Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?  Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?
Is this to be an empathy test?
Black?
Almost through.
I'm tired of this.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
How do you know I'm not?
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.
Sorry.
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
But I understand what you mean.
I never seen a turtle.
Same thing.
Of course.
Know what a turtle is?
A tortoise.  What's that?
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
But how come I'd be there?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
What desert?
What?
What one?
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
Sorry.
Don't move.
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
Sure.
Your mom was a dancer?
You're kidding!
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
He's really funny!
This is my new friend...
Bravo!
Oh, now, that's a great one!
Yes?
Young man, stop right there!
Let's go talk first, Adam.
Well, that depends...
My office.
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
Eve? I'm leaving.
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
Do ya?
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
What?!
Oh, brother...
How 'bout a drink at the bar?
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
Yes, sir.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
What?
Yes, it is.
Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
Yes.
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
Goodnight.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Twenty-five? Around there.
You don't look thirty-five.
How old are you?
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
The hotel.
You dial nine to get out.
I don't see anything!
The sky?  Where?
What?  What is it?!
Gladly.
Sure.
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Help you?
I do alright.
Say what?!
Whatcha looking at?
Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
Oh, you got a problem with that?
Well, we're here to help!
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Really? No kidding?
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
Hi.
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
Yeah.
Good god.
Yeah.
He drank it hot?
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
All back East.
What about relatives?
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Good.
You got a light, honey?
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
I forgot some of my stuff.
What are you bitching about now?
I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
Buy it from me?
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
Um...uh...
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
Roger, Wolf One.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
Tower, say again!!
Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
Wolf One -- say intentions.
Stand by. One.
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Okay honey.
I've seen a few.
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
I'm not sick.
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck. Cheers.
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
To your health, Frank.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Frank. Come in.
Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
He's comin' back? What for?
Bull.
Frank gone?
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  Hey, pretty, pretty.
Can I feel 'em?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Look at these. What are these?
Then, shut up!
You want to see him too, right?
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh? You wanta go for a ride?
Who's this fuck?
Baby wants to fuck.
MOMMY!
My bourbon.
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?
What are you lookin' at?
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back.
Hey? You like to walk.
Do you see, Ben? I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Go where?
No thanks. What does that mean?
Speak to me Fucker.
Good, let's drink up.
There ya go.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
What kinda beer do you like?
Okay Frank.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Of course, Jeffrey.
Alright.
Do you want the car?
Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
I'll get a coat for her.
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. Just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
He comes over to study.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Would you like a piece of cake?
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Good to see you, son.
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
Hey Jeff.
You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Come on out a minute, okay?
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
What are watchin' this junk for?
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
Go find one.
There's ways around that.
Your dad and I used him three times over twenty years, only when everything went totally fucked. Believe me kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him. He is... a fuckin' monster.
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
This kid, this package boy could bring down the whole east coast. If he decides to turn states he could dismantle us... totally. But it looks like for now, he's content with just killing us one by one. And even worse the kid is good at it. I mean I had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn't even know it.
The Duke?  What did you do?
I need Il Duce.
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
Hey, I just...
I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you?
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
Fuck you.
Aye.
Are ya ready?
I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry.  My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!
Yes mother.
Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.
What did you do, Connor?
Mother Mary, full of grace.
Lord's name.
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
Got it.
I can't find the second one, sir.
Yes sir.
All right, I suppose you have the right ta know.
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
BLAME...
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
Connor, is that you?
Ass!
Fuck!
Right.
y-y-yeah that's what he said.
What are you going to do?
An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
Rule of thumb?
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
How do you figure?
That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
Maybe the three of them had something in common.
Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
Three.
They were wearing masks.
She was in here when it went down.
So, what do we do now?
Uh... two shooters!
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
It was... It was...
Pee...Per...Man.
My, my...
You killed my... my...
You... oh god, why?
Where's my cat?
Rocco!
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
A couple of peons for the mob and...
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
Witness?
Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
Shit! Shit!
Eight.
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Chief, what the fuck is this?
Who the...
Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are you?
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
Promise me boys.
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil.
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
I...
I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
Continue the joke.
He's a nigger.
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.
Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the fuck down!
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.
Like silk?
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
Cuba.
No.
Dies y nueve.
Where were you?
Where'd they come from?
Feel this.
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
I hear you're a good thief.
You're Anthony?
What?
You don't celebrate til it's over.
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
What's he doing here?
That's your friend Anthony?
Is that him?
Is that Buckethead?
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
I don't know about that.
You're the faggot.
Right. I'm sorry.  You've got a reputation to think about.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
I might have mentioned it.
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
How's that 700 bucks coming?
He said you ran away from home.
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
This boy's a troublemaker. He used to tear this place apart.
You keeping out of trouble?
How you doing, Bob?
Ground defense.
Social issues. Crime prevention.
26 weeks.
Can't get it. It won't...
Why did he go that way?
Where did he go?
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
Where?
He left his sweater.
We're closed, sir.
No, it's not.
Come on in!
How's the weather down there?
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
You Hoto?
Fight. You know.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
She is a good looking woman.
Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita?
You a good pool player.
You like Chicanos?
She Chicano, yes?
Is that your chiquita?
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
Nice to meet you.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
What?
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
Bourne comes here? Why?
What?
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
One last push. One.
Anything else?
And the Landy woman?
Will it track back to us?
There was a mistake.
Okay...
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
The sooner the better.
Sir...
-- take the back -- get another car --
-- my coat -- but we should --
I'm sorry.
She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
I don't know! Why would I lie?
I don't know who that is.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
I don't know.
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
He's dead.
What do you want?
So why didn't you kill me then?
I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
Sorry. Old habits.
Felt a little light.
Hold on...  Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room...
You're sure?
But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
What?
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
-- go -- take the van! --
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
Looks like he's been detained.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
I'm working on it.
-- shut up! -- just shut the --
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
-- who? -- who else is here? --
Is there. Is all there.
This is everything? Is there.
Now. Show now.
Here?
Show me.
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
Still...
It's a lot of money, Pam.
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is...
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
If you ever want to make it to five, you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. A week ago, he assassinated two men in Berlin, one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer...
Me? Four years.
How long have you worked for the agency?
Pamela Landy, again. Where do we stand?
Who's this?
Mr. Nevins?
Yes. In that order.
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself.
Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
Someone dead from this household?
Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we?  Did he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum et --  ...It was Malcolm's favorite.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened.
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
He has already agreed to come.
We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
It is suicide.
We cannot defeat this --
We must sue for peace.
Invade?! That's impossible, it --
But... what will you do?
You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
Longshanks promised!
He will. I know he will.
He won't come.
That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear.
He was a modest man.
May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
Does anyone know his politics?
He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
Young Robert, we are honored --
You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower?
But if we have not caught Wallace --
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
The Scots will fight for us?
Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
Wallace has sacked York!
I have ordered conscriptions...
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
What news of the north?
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
You fancy him.
Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
The little cow is insane --
Wallace's followers.
You mock us with a smile?
You may.
Now, my flower, do you understand?
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
So I did! And what was so important about it?
What is it?!
Keep these. We're going too.
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
That's just a dream, William!
I don't want to be a martyr.
You know it's a trap.
Your rest is making me exhausted.
Rest, William.
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
Aye.
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Fourteen? --
I'll wait... back there.
I should'a remembered the eggs.
You'll move
I could crush you like a roach.
That depends on the man.
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
Test of manhood.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
Wanna stay with me tonight?
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
Armed?
How many?
They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way!
We don't split up!
We must run in different directions!
A patriot!
A common thief.
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
In order to find his equal, and Irishman is forced to talk to God.  Yes, Father!...  The Almighty says don't change the subject, just answer the fookin' question.
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?
All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we make.
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
Let her speak.
My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him.
I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
Where is my son?
Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
It matters not, he is thy king!
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
I must... consult with my father.
I am trying.
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
Come, it'll help you sleep.
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
Who would do such a thing?
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
We can't stop!
When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...
I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
Weirder than this?
You need to see the prison shrink, man.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
Straight up.
Jesus himself couldn't make me take on the Brotherhood. When they come, just put your mind in another place, man. Be somewhere else.
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
Fuck off, frat boy.
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
Are you stupid or what?
What the fuck are you doing?
You really think he wanted to kill you?
That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
Like Ozzy.
I thought you were a December baby.
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
...yes.
Who -- who are you?
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Me neither.
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn. Now take a seat. The exam's about to begin.
And you are...?
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
Just don't drop the ball, okay?
I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right?
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
Come on, go on...
Deal. Now read me something.
Wow... read something.
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
You're kidding. He's so... big.
Smells like sex in here.
So what's the point?
Destroy it?
What?
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
Are you sure you even packed it?
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
I couldn't cut the rope.
Gee, thanks friend.
Can... can... Can I have this?
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
Listen to me good, Evan...
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
Look what you made me do!
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
Sorry. Never heard of her.
Meant no offense.
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
Just get out, didja?
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
Lenny? Come on!
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides, we're here already.
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
I thought I was the bad guy!
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
Here you go, buddy.
You're such a retard!
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
Yes, Monsieur.
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.
Good.
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I come, I will do it.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
Yes, I come.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
I won't.
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
Monsieur Rick!
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
I'm awfully sorry.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
Er, goodbye, sir.
I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you...
Er, my check, please.
I'd better be going.
Er, good luck, yes.
Here's to you, sir.
Take your hands off me!
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up.
Give me another.
Will I see you tonight?
Where were you last night?
Nobody remembers that.
It's bad.
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
Keep painting.  Promise me.
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
You are.  Yes you are.  What gave you the idea to paint on that cave?
I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
Oh?  You've tried?
Yeah.  A long time ago.
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
You know what happened to this?
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
I've got lots of time.
Must be a story there.
You?  Personally?
What brings you out to the sticks?
Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
And how was your Christmas?
Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
If you say you are.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
You're Chuck Noland.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
Thought you were going to bring her.
Let's eat.
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
I'm doing fine.
Don't you even think about it.
Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring out the store bought.
That new roof, that's your doing.
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
What happened to your pants?
You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization.  I don't have it.
Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.
Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check.
Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.
Trying.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
Kamal is not here.
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
San Francisco.  And you?
Permission granted.
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
You mean somebody asked?
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
Nobody ever wants me!
I thought they might take me.
Does he *know* he's supposed to be in India? Does he even *want* to come back?
I just wanted to ask you...
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
He's leaving...
That's a heavy sedation.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
What's an immigrant?
Did you grow up around here?
What's a nanny do?
Did you know your mother better?
But did you know him?
*Liver* killed him?
Is *your* father dead?
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
Is that soon?
His father's dead, right?
That's why Kong loves her!
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
I don't remember.
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
There's not a lot of work in the winter, and you'll have to tolerate Vernon--even Wally despises him, and Wally likes everyone.
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
We heard that one already, Homer.
Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it.
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
Who cares?
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
Do you know him?
Four weeks or so, right around Halloween.
When will he be home, Major?
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
Then it's malaria?
Because the crew thought he'd gone down with the plane. They were hospitalized for almost a week in China before they were flown back to India. It wasn't until that they sorted through their gear...
Why was he missing for twenty days?
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.
They're *outrageous*, them rules!
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
It look nicer then home!
We see you next harvest.
Sorry, Homer...
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
*You* taught her, I suppose...
I told him that you all is sick.
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
*What* view?
What view?
He ain't never been outta Maine!
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
She took off on the bicycle, man.
She took off in the night!
Rose Rose has runned away!
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.
I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
Good boy.
I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
Ring it for him, Sobo.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Was that a threat? Did I hear a threat? Last I remember, we were talking economics, then this...? What happens next time if we gotta stop and help a little old lady cross the street? Well, shit... Then we gotta pass the call to someone else.
Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.
Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
Sure.
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
Attractive girl.
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
Great. Thank you.
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
Sorry, I --
What about... The money?
What -- What do we do?
Oh Jesus!
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
With identification.
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
What was it?
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
Do you have a ticket?
Okay. Here's the thing... You fall flat, you might not get anything short of stiffed. Then it's Blue River Land for everybody. Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply, then they start to take shape. Usually it's the shape of an arrow. I hate to do it, but after this, I gotta give you the blowoff. We Jake, Jake?
Still time.
Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want.
So what do you want?
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
Then who's the Banker?
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.
Can I speak to you in confidence?
In over your head?
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with heroin?
The King, huh? Nice going.
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
We're here.
You guys awake?
Let's just say he burned me once.
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
Did he buy it?
Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.
Special Agent?
Roger that.
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
You guy's are not working with me here. I just got off the phone with my boss. After he got done ripping me a new Lincoln Tunnel size asshole, he let me know exactly how little I'm welcome back if we come up short. And now here you guys are, WASTING MY FUCKING TIME!
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?
Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
Not everyone's on the take, Walter.
That's it?
Peace of mind.
What do you get out of it?
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
What do you want?
Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card.  Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His "Fix."
I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
Who?
Put your hand down. I don't high five.
High five.
What are you doing?
I'm down!
That's what I'm talking about.
It's just insurance.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
You trust this Moonan guy?
Whoa, whoa... There he is.
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
What's he going to do? File a missing drugs report? If it works out, this guy might be good for a few more turns.
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
To who?
You sell it.
Seven-fifty.
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
How about five hundred.
That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition.
What kind of deal you looking to?
Don't let yourself down.
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion.
I've set this up for you. Call the Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds, he's the Manager. I don't know him personally, but I've spoken to his boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give yourself a break.
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
Found a job?
You did?
Ross.
Detective Inspector Ross.
Where to?
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
I might.
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
I'm Lucy.
You've been avoiding me.
It was you, you shit.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
I put them on together.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
Thanks.
Armed.
Check at six minutes.
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Energy shielding positive function.
How I make my living, what's your point?
No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go.
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
Oh, yeah?
Who are you?
Where?
Move it.
No.
Can I say something in my defense?
Leave.  Now.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
You know each other?
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Some of us are trying to sleep.
Could you give us a moment.
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
Do you know why I went after Justine?
Justine was not an unwilling participant.
You're not still pissed?
How're ya doin', Max.
But I'm afraid of--
No way.
Lemme put some clothes on.
What?  Where're we going?
What is it?
You're roommates?
What are you doing here?
I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact... At least I tried.
I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
Yeah, well around here, I'm the Most High... From now on, before you do anything, call in for instructions.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
Which is none of your business...or mine.
Like de prophets say, "Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman."
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
So Max, what do you do with all your money?
Am I?
I'll make it worth your while.
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
What're you looking for?
Same old story.  Not interested.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
Where'd you clip this?
You didn't...
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
What a creep.
Yech...
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
Hello...
What else can we do?
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
Can you help me get her back?
I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
They took my daughter.
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.
Mommy, I'm scared.
Soon, baby.
When?
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
Mommy, where are you?
Sophy?  Are you okay?
Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
What makes you cry?
Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
No...
Are we in some kind of trouble?
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
But why can't we stay here?
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
I don't want to move away.
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
None.
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
Can't help you.
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
You don't want to.
Ladies would be elsewhere.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
Got a pencil?
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
Your fiance has four previous wives.  His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off.  Which is what you oughta do.
I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don't even know... Maybe if you could give me something more on her...anything you can remember, some detail...
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
Right here someplace.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
You get it when I get her.
She's got my word.
Make the call.
And she bought that?
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
Pull the cash.
Who are you?
I actually know how this works.
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
I'll bet you can.  Sit.
Tell everybody hey.
What if he's on the level?
I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
You're the best, Maxie.
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
What about this?
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
For a change.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
More like deployed in bed asleep.
I want you on call here.
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
More than anything in the world.
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
Gin.
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Pick a song, Hawk.
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here.
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?
Oh, screw it!
We've got to take this slow...
You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear that... Jam!
I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
Believe it.
Jeremiah?
Sorry.
No problem.
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
What? That's disgusting!
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
Sure.
Oh, yeah...?
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
Are you gettin' wise with me?
And if it ain't cleaned off?
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Guess you don't want to see the greatest show on earth. And in Detroit no less. Well, take care, chief.
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
The easy way.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you.  He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it.
What?!
Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less!
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
NOW!
Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
A bustier?
Was it a teddy?
Well? Continue! Continue!
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
No...
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
That's it?
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
It's not nearly enough, punk.
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
No really. My brother's hanging onto it for safe keeping. Please, let me get him for you.
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
I don't even think you have a gun!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Gimme your gun, boy!
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Yeah, you did!
I did?
Trip? You just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to KISS live at Cobo Hall tonight!
Yeah.
Is that your final answer?
Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour.
GOOD MORNING!
Are you AFRAID?
GOOD MORNING!
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
Good MORNING!
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
Good morning...
Good morning, mongrels!
Did you know him?
I feel bad for his family.
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
I'm not following you.
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
Beg pardon?
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
A metal craft of any kind.
The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
Theoretically.
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
Donnie.
Donnie! Give it back!
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
I'm telling Mom.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
When can I squeeze one out?
What did you say?
You know what? I think that you did it.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
I am so sorry.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
You have a request?
I want to show you something.
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
You'll know soon enough.
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
How old is Grandma Death?
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
It feels wonderful.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
That is a terrible nickname.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
When did you stop taking your medication?
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
I know I'm not the best... communicator.  But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool.  But what you've got to understand, son, is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than all of them.
You're my only son...
Who's been giving you weird looks?
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
Grandma Death.
Oh, shit!
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
Know what?
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
So how was school today?
Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
Who is Frank?
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Why would I tell Mom?
What's her name?
So I hear you have a girlfriend.
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
If that's what you think is necessary.
I... What can we do?
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
Frank?
Come again?
Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
He was a year ahead of us?
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
What?
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
You're not a bitch.
Our son just called me a bitch.
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.
It is a big deal.
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
How did you know --
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
You can suck a fuck.
That's enough.
Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
Donnie? You're a dick.
Excuse me?
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
I guess they made him do it.
How did this happen?
Yep.
Christ. Is that an axe?
What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.
What else?
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
But now you can't go.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Beg pardon?
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Kitty...
Rose.
Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
I think we've all seen "Bonanza".
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
Kitty...
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...
I stole four beers from my dad.
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
Not Vanity. He's a homo.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
No more fuckin' for her.
Wicked.
Raspberry.
What is this shit?
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
There's no rule!
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
Go back to China, bitch!
Chut up!
Oh-you-beccha.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
Amber? Here.
I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't...
Oh, Amber...
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
Huh?
Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
Amber...
Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
We all do. Now let's go.
Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy.
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
What?
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
And the bite marks on my ears?
Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck?
So, anyone talk to Janelle?
Here, have some.
Okay... well, bye.
Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.
So if, uh, you wanted to do somethin'...
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
Hi...
Listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. Now get your ass up there and show me some teeth.
My dress'll reek.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
The important thing is that we have a winner...
The bitch.
All right, then.
Wisconsin.
What?
That bitch from...
Ohio...
Dakota.
Yeah.
People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
Mm-hm.
Okay?
That's right.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
I'm a mirror.
"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
And the year before that?
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls --
Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.
Yeah.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Tammy Curry?
...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
That's enough!
Becky was my only shot at state!
So help me, Gladys.
Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. Ah- hahahahahahahaha!
Gladys! Stop it!
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
Yeah, yeah, the Jew.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.
Lester?
We're not in the showroom, Dear.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
...You betcha. S'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...
I swear to God she can't do anything by herself.
Enid ate a whole pan!
This is -- what?
We need more bars!
What!
Uh, Gladys?
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
Yeah.
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
"Proud... to be... an... American."
Oh! What is it?
All right, let's go.
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
Y'betcha, Iris. We still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.
Nothin' too showy!
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner, I'm just gonna leave it in ya.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
Close up shop!
Harold!
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
I will if you shut your piehole.
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
The king can do to wrong!
The king can do no wrong!
And everything.  He should be king!
He should be king!
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride.
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share.
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
Are you sure you're not tired?
Are you getting tired?
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it.  I will stay here in Freedonia.
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
I thought everything was working out fine.
It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...
Uncle, you can't do this!
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
So that's the one you want to marry.
Like this.
Our man is sick. Come right away.
I found it.
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
Don't!
What are you going to do?
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
You never mentioned his mental state.
Nothing of any importance, eh?
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
I say Freddie, what are you about?
What a mess.
Three quarters of an hour.
I know no way to mince it in love, but directly to say "I love you". What! A speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curl'd pate will grow bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly.
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Have you read it?
That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
You've never been?
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
She's very pretty, your mother.
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
I knew you'd understand. Here.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
Is he... dying then?
How awful for John.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
Good day, Mr. Merrick.
You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction.
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
Won't be a moment.
Of course! You want out?
Want to come out?
You alright?
Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
What's this?
It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
Where did you get this box?
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Never mind. I'm the owner.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
And who might you be, sir?
That I cannot tell you.
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
The sky WAS blue, Erik... once.
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
Is it summer or winter, Erik?
Is it night or day, Erik?
What do you see, Erik?
They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
Don't you FEEL it?
I know. I know.
He wants to KILL us.
Halfdan the Black's here!
That's terrible!
You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".
Let's hack her to pieces.
Very deep... usually...
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
It's Halfdan the Black!
What are you talking about?
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
But...
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
That's my boy!
So? What'd you do to her?
It's always the women that start the trouble.
Who have you been talking to?
You talking piffle, son?
What?
We're missing all the fun...
Make your mind up.
Sorry!
Sorry.
I want to die...  No, I don't!
He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.
Look... Erik...
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
So?
Why should WE care?
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
No! Arrgh!
I've got you!
Weren't we supposed to?
A magic dishcloth.
Like fish.
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
Trust me to get the missionary.
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Thank you VERY much indeed.
You mean we'd be dead?
No, don't say anything else!
I think we should go...
Just say something cheerful.
You need to say a bit more than that!
Who gets killed?
Please.
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
What d'you expect me to do?
You will wait?
Yeah... well...
Bye... sorry...
Bye, Leif.
Well, where is he then?
Vanish into thin air?
How did he do that?
Nothing... I just immerse you in water...
It can't do you any HARM...
What's all the panic about?
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
Your lord.
You know, my son, our lord said...
No, it is NOT.
Same thing, isn't it?
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
You're wasting your time.
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
Mum! Dad!
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that!
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
That's it!
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
Bastard.
He used to puke in his sleep.
Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL.
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
I know. I know.
I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
No, I'm not.
Are you all right?
What have you got there?
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Oh...
Who's that?
Well! Come on!
No... he's not... not... there...
I'm not frightened... of anything...
Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
Me too.
Well I'M certainly not, either.
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
I never do...
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
And keep your sword greased.
No, Mother.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
Yes, Mum.
And something to sharpen them with?
Yes, Mother.
And you've got BOTH axes?
Who was the girl you walked off with?
I told you that later.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
I did. You said, things were fine.
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
Say hi to Naomi.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Sweetie, we called the company.
You weren't supposed to see that.
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
No, it was lovely.
And I just liked you so much.
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
Your dried cum.
Guess what I'm wearing.
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
I probably got the same thing as you.
Yeah?
Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
What took you so long?
That's me.
Long day thinking.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
Hi.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
She's so sexy.
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
That's your look for me.
Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
It's too late.
The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
I'm like a joke to them.
There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
He went home sick.
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
Maybe after the holidays then.
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
Of course. Please have a seat.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
Oh, hi.
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
A traveler, eh?
You don't?
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
What guy?
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
Well.... er...
How does she like what in bed?
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
Extraordinary!
Why? Why do you have to go?
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
What are you doing?
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
Whooee!
You're the best?
Hitchhiking?
So now you're bummin' around?
For magazines?
Are you in show business?
Thanks.
You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
I think I found something...
Holy shit...
I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.
So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
That means top-secret, Cooper.
Ballast.
Please... kill...
Please...
What happened?
No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.  But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen...  And what it's brought back with it.
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
Do you hear it? Right there.
It gets worse.
They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
No.
"Another man?" Who?
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...
His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
Trauma.
One thing at a time, let's keep him breathing. Start the drip, 15cc's fibrinogen, Christ, he's bleeding out...
Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
He's crashing...
Pressure?
What's wrong?
A power drain --
What's wrong?
Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing you any favors.
It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
Some things you don't get over.
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
What's on your mind?
Does he know that?
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
You're not seriously considering sending him?
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
From the Other Place...
...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
The dark inside me.
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
I'm going in.
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
How do you know all this?
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
...I don't want to die...!
Skipper, you gotta help me...
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
Yes, sir!
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
Relax, it's casual.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
I mean...
I wouldn't know anything about that.
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
What did you wish for, honey?
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
Baby, you're scaring me.
Ben?
Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
No: You're ON FIRE!
You're on fire!
Last one down springs for room service.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
You're hot!
And where do we think we're going?
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
Then what is it?
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
They're ready for you, sir.
And if he's not...?
Skeptical...?
Reed's gonna fix me up --
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
'Scuse me.
All right!!
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
How much did they cost?
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton.
Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
Manager!!
I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.
No. I want my money back right now.
You're fired.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
Any problems?
Jeff you have company!
Dad says!
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Dad says you have to get up!
It's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I put it out, and I have personally found that girls do respond.
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
You're losing it, Damone.
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
No Damone. I don't understand.
Chicken!
Really.
Okay. See ya.
Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
Damone! You come here?
Damone, are you there?
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
Damone. It's Mark.
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
Yeah?
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Really?
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
No. It's too soon.
No.
She's in my biology class.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
And they don't call my parents?
I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something.
Are you Linda Barrett?
What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?
Are you going to ride that wave?
Who's that?
Fascinating.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
How often do you go?
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
How've you been?
That's him! He did it!
You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
My brother is gonna shit.
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
My brother's car!
They're fuckin' with us.
This ain't no cop.
I like sex.
Suzanne Somers' tits.
Seen the new Playboy?
He is.
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
Is this your first time?
No. I mean back to your home.
I think I better take you home.
Are you really nineteen?
It's very warm out tonight.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
All right, the point it is.
How about the point?
Where do you feel like going?
'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.'  You look nice tonight.
No problem.
How about your phone number?
You look like you could still be in high school.
Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
Really?
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
I'll get you the notes.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
It's John Bonham's birthday.
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
Well... it's getting kind of late.
...I've got to go home.
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
Sure.
I don't know.
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
Naw. I don't mind.
No. That's okay.
Where's your brother?
Okay. Sure. I'll come in.
Aren't your parents asleep?
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
I had a really nice time tonight.
Two more Cokes.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Oh yeah.
Excellent.
Do you know what you want?
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Yeah. It's my sister's.
Sure thing.
Oh... yes.
My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
You keep them.
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
Okay. Thanks.
Two Cokes.
Anything to drink?
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Are you ready to order here?
What?
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
WHAT?
Naked!?
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
What do you mean by that?
Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
Really?
Naw! Not a major.
A major!
And nobody did anything?
What happened? What did they do to her?
Not down in my parts.
Naw!
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
This is my granddaughter...
That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
Where ya comin' from, young man?
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
What?
Hell, no!
I fear nothing.
Alice. Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.
You'd pay me for that?
No! I swear I'm not!
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
Nobody. I'm the maid!
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
That's a strange attitude.
You realize...
Could I have that, please?
May I see your license.
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
What?
Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
Part of what?
I don't know what you're talking about!
They'll get in! We'll all die!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
Stop!
I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case...  ...on the eye.
Spare me.
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
I don't know, I just got here. Did you find your girl?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
Where are you two going?
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
We should go! We should go right now!
I will not die because of him!
I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --
Right.
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
I don't think you should...
I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
Well, it don't look pretty.
Her fella.
Nah, I got the gun.
Yeah.
We're lucky to be alive.
We shot a skunk.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
Stop it.
Anyone.
Who the hell would you call?
I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
Gonna stay for a couple?
One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
You gotta be with me on this.
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
We'll be food, dickheads!
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
You got something better?
OPEN THE DOOR!
Wha?
"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
Oh!
Come on, come on.
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
Upstairs.
Where's that?
I think I know where a CB is.
C'mon guys--
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
You seem mighty collected about this.
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
Shit!
In the corner, behind the curtain.
You all sure about this?
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
What!? I'm not going down there again!
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
There's a tunnel.
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
They're right here.
Well, justice is funny.
So, your husband ditched you?
And the head?
And the rest of 'em?
Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
Just an observation.
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
Look.
What?
Ohhh.
The door... on three.
I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
Of course not. I fight monsters all the time.
No. You?
Scared?
Get in line!
Fuck you too.
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
My truck.
What now, Geronimo?
He's dead.
Come on!
Who's with me?
We're better off.
Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards, partner.
Well then I guess we should just give up.
Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
Oh yeah?
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
Go douche.
You weren't helpin'.
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
Fuck no.
Why don't you go check it out?
So, what now? Did those things leave?
We lived near power lines.
Your parents of relation?
Yep.
Your brother, huh?
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Why do you take shit from him?
Just cover me. It was built to move.
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
Nothing, this was my last delivery.
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
We gotta be close.
We gotta try.
I'm in.
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
I'll go with ya.
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
I wouldn't do that, son.
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
Sit still, look less like a meal.
Oh? And what's that?
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
Whoa!
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
Get outta here.
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
Clear!
Blow the goddamn hatch!
What the hell's going on here!?
Clever fuckers.
No bullshit.
Bullshit.
Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
You smell like ass!
They were all over the place.
F-f-fuck you.
Welcome back.
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
Yeah, maybe.
HELLLLLLLLP!!
SHIT.
REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
I'm fine! I'm fine!
You keep that key handy.
No shit.
What?!
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
What?
Gimme the keys.
Duh hickey.
Got 'cha!
HELLLPPP!
OH JESUS!
Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose.
Am I too heavy for you?
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
Amazing you made it this far.
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
BONSAI!
HELP MEEE!
I'm sure.
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
Yeah, I'll go.
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Hey!
Well, maybe they migrate?
Let's wait it out.
DON'T!
She's not very nice, is she?
What's wrong?
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
GO-GO-GO!!
Not without you!!!
If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
Let's go!
Whoa!
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
And the last one is the...
Did we make it?
I'd love to.
Deal.
I'll do anything to help.
Oh...
We all have to be strong, right?
I'm fine, I really am.
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
Oh my God... What is that?
I just hit it like you said.
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
I said I'm not lying.
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
I'm not lying.
What did we say about lying?
Well...
Are you lying to me?
Um, well...
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
What're you doing?
Frances?  Oh no.
Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.
Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
Well... come on.
I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!
Oh. I mean, good.
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
Excuse me, sir?
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
Very fine bone structure.
I guess so, sir.
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
Who's this?
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
I'd like nothing better.
That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act.
No, I'm concerned with everything.
Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.
Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It."
I intend to make a great deal of money off you.
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
You see: We've got to change that name.
...acts. I'll relay your message.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
You know what I mean.
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
Come here. I want to show you something.
Okay, but come here first.
Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house...  her bedroom. I can't ask you to...
Madam...?
Good, good. Give them that.
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
You're afraid!
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
He knows, Frances.
Right now we have to be practical.
I know, but --
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
An actress.
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
He's not here.
Frances.
...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --
You're under arrest.
Get your clothes on, lady --
Get your clothes on.
I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it.
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
Hey, where's the fire, sister?
Good. 'Cause I don't want to see you again.
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
Harry!
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
We'll get you home, Frances.
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
I know you believe that.
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!
Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!
Were you a drug addict?
Were you an alcoholic?
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
Occupation?
Address?
Age?
Name?
Run!
What'd you do?
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Where you goin'?
And no people.
Pretty morning.
You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late.
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen --
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
Did you expect him to look you up?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
...Is that not true?
I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
Who're you?
You got it.
The speech? Real good.
I already have.
Your big speech?
Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
'Golden Boy.'
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
I don't believe so.
Yes...?
On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
Good! Because, Brothers, that's you!
No! No!
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
No!
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
No!
And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?
'Incurable.'
What?
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
You're kidding.
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
Yeah?
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
What kindness?
I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.
Then why weep for him?
And he drove me to mine.
You drove him to his torment.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
I was watching.
Yes.
You were with him at the end.
I am afraid.
People can be kinder than you think.
I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
Why do you not go to them?
Yes. Very close
Friends? Do they live around here?
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
You're an outcast.
Worse.
It can't be as bad as that.
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
Why?
Better that way... for me.
I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
The music? Or the fire?
Nice.
GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor.
She's beautiful.
That is mild compared to what will come. If you deny me my wedding night. I'll be with you on yours.
You will honor your promise to me!
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
A brain. Extremities.
Her body pleases me.
I'll be waiting. And watching.
Soon?
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
There is something I want.  A friend.
Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
Your crime... as well as mine.
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
Kill you? Hardly that.
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
Come warm yourself if you like.
Fine.
Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
So have I
It's been months. It's not like him.
Must've been a terrible row.
You dance so beautifully together.
One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
Quite right!
Poor William! What indignant tears!
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
Have you seen Willie?
What does it say?
He always was opinionated.
Aye, Captain.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
A warming wind.
Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
It wouldn't dare.
It's going to ram us.
Oh God.
No. But someday.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
I have no knowledge of that.
So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
I have always loved him.
And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
Of Geneva.  Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. Do you wish to study medicine? Or mysticism?
What is your name?
Paracelsus?
Philosophical?
In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?
Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
Re-configure the leads?
Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.
"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
Electricity.
I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
You disdain accepted wisdom?
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
Victor, explain yourself.
Who are you?
Madness?
Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
You know of it?
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
Are you a physician?
You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
We should go now.
I will protect you.
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
Good night, Alice.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
Melvin Belli.
Right! Right!
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
Thanks, Alice.
You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful.
You want to leave?
Any particular reason?
You draw very well.
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
I'm sorry.
Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
I need you so much, Claudette.
Let's go back, Barry...
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
Somebody's there, Barry.
No, they won't...
Somebody'll see.
Claudette...
Oh, you...
I wouldn't know.
I can't, Barry...
You know what I said, though.
I meant everything.
You said we were special.
You just had some lucky shots.
I'll spot you five points.
Get behind him more.
What is it?
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
Thanks.
You saved my life.
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
Here we go.
Give me a hand?
What the hell?
Ha! You wily oriental! The phone was "Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you." "What hath God wrought" was the telegraph.
That was the telephone.
What hath God wrought?
Whatever you make yourself.
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
Holy shit...
Dancer.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
God, but I love that sexy talk.
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
I don't believe you...
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.
It's gonna be a long summer.
Coach, athletic director somewhere.
Jack?
Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
Ow!
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
Ha!
Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.
Whassamatta?
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
Umhummmmph.
Best over...
Mmmmmmmph.
Mmmmmmmph?
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
Are you wet?
Lead the way!
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
I call it my shower dream.
It's just a dream.
You? The brick?
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
Looks like a storm.
I guess...
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
Don't call him.
Ned!
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
I don't love Neddy.
What about Neddy?
I love you.
I love you.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
Good call.
How about our last jay?
But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it.
Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...
Those things can be nasty.
You okay?
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
Rocky Road.
Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
Okay, Fireman.
Girls can't be cowboys.
Cowboy.
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
It's beautiful...
There you are dead wrong.
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
For two lonely nights.
That's thirty percent.
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
...I know what you mean. Two and a quarter. Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.
I mean...
One night on the town.
How much do I owe you?
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
Aw.
I got to.
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
Anything else you want?
Yeah.
Another coincidence.
Good luck.
Sure.
Have to drop you here, Steve.
You've made a science out of coincidence.
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
Why not?
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
Open the door. I'm coming aboard.
You said it was just you and your son.
What was that?
What is your purpose in Mexico?
How many with you?
Vamanos!
Yeah, follow us.
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
You like the car?
Twenty-eight.
Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
Why did they block the door again?
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
You don't believe in suicide.
He's running the show.
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there.
What are you gonna do?
What's this guy's problem?
Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us into Mexico.
Why do you want to stop?
The truth hurts.
Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
-- see this, television!
-- you got your sink --
Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
I would say that's a very safe assumption.
Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.
What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
Six-fifty.
Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?
Knock yourself out.
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
Whatsamatter?
Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
Not even for lunch?
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
Hot goddamn day!
I never said help us!
I wasn't scratching!
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
What do you want from me? I did what you said.
Best in Mexico.
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
You can't come in here.
He's beyond our help. You saw him get bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it. You can't help him. I've got no one left to lose but you. I can't be alone again. We're sticking together.
He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.
You could take their head off.
Yeah, it's mine.
Okay, I'll have one.
Wow...
Uh... don't see it.  There's no signature.  But hang on -- there's a note to "See Addendum."  Checking...
Got it.
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Who's...  Lieuten --
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
I've been accused of that wish.
Just some of the women.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
No problem, lieutenant.
B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
Entering my scan now...
No problem, sir!
Motherachrist...
Aw, what is this...
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
Fuck me.
Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!
Hey.  Ain't your call, man.
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Smoke her.
Shit.  Think we're had.
Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
Did you hear?
Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.
White House boys want a private meeting.
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
I was one member of the investigating commission.
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
Hardly the case, Senator.
... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --
"G.I. Jane."  And which one of you told me she wouldn't last a week? Huh?
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
Doesn't matter who she picks.  No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course.  And I don't care who it is.
Then I suggest we start there.
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
So she picks the women, we pick the programs.  Seals?
Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!
Close as I can get, el-tee!
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
'Snot me.  It's him.
I'll work on it, ma'am.
No, ma'am.
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
You're wanted at the C.O.'s.
O'Neil?
Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
... two... one... MARK!
Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three...
I think you probably would -- if you didn't know I was right.
I oughtta report you.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
Get it up!
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.
Time.
Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
Maybe half.  Not even.
Smoke it!
32 feet, six inches!
Mighta been civilian.
She part of the training?
Just askin'
O'Neil...
Got it.
Say again?  How many micks?
Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.
Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed all the others.  Now try me.
Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
I think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect.
Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?
I'm so glad we agree.
Do you?
You think we should go easy on women, O'Neil?
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
Would you have shot if it was a man?
She led us right to you.  That's no threat?
Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why.  This is my island.  My world.  And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside.  If I can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you?  Huh?
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
You were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer.  Remember.  There are no bad crews -- only bad leaders.
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.
Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
Educate her, Pyro.
You heard me.  Move on.
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
You don't suppose this is just part of...
I just wonder how that happened.
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
Clear.
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?
This ain't even workin' wrong!
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
This ain't workin' right!
So am I.
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
We are so fucked.
Darth Vader reads poetry...
We're fucked.
This is what you get for brain- picking an old CIA spook.  but if I needed to control the outcome of this test case, that's how I'd do it.  A man-in-place.  Makes everything very controllable.
Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
I take it this file is still open.
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew.
Thought you two were file-closed.
Subject?
Go in there. Talk to her.
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
Audrey, you're too damned nice, that's your problem. Nice gets you nothin' in this town. You gotta be a killer to get ahead, you know what I'm sayin'? I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't got what it takes.
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
I left my forgery kit back at the office.
Your old sweetheart?
What the hell are you doing?
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
Did Romeo have a name?
Who is he?
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
Speak of the devil.
Five bucks.
What do I get?
What's it to you?
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
Not now. You got my bag?
What?
It's your choice.
So have dinner with me tonight.
Call me Charlie.
And you're beautiful...
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
This is not the place...
I'll try.
I'm sorry about all this.
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
Hence the radiation.
Well, I think you're cute.
You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
Really? A girlfriend then?
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
They didn't make it.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
We've secured the doors on both levels.
That is when we will go in.
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
Allez, allez!
Merde!
And how should we do that, Sir?
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
That is our job.
CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
They are with me!
You don't have the authority to do that.
That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
But you don't know for sure!
I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
It's Raymond.
Who the hell are you?
What'd they say?
555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
I think we should leave now.
You were right.
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
Makes us look more American.
So you're in?
Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
I am not permitted to speak of such things.
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
We, have already taken care of them.
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
I need you to trust me.
We know.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
It's the French Secret Service.
SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond.
We've met before.
Are you looking for this?
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
Oh.  Okay.
Hi Brandon.
He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
Systems register functional.
Systems register functional.
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
The enemy is matching velocity.
The ship is sustaining structural damage.
There is no weather in space.
Yes?
Structural damage at 68 percent.
OK!
So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
Covalent... Right. So...
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
... What does that mean?
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
U.... What do you think?
As good as Hopkins?
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
No, I'll kill you. .
Right.
No, no... I'll think on it...
A hologram...
Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
Maybe you're the plucky comic relief, you ever think of that?
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
It's suicide.
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
...The digital conveyor.
I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
You Okay, Alex?
Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
How do you remember this stuff?
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
I am SO SICK of being right.
Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
Something BAD happened here.
Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
It's ... incredible.
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
We're screwed... We're so screwed...
No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
Yeah, what is it?
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
They're still behind us...
...Okay
~e're alive!
We're alive!
Not a clue. You?
Where'd they go? Back inside?
We're doing episode 31?
More to the left... Stay parallel...
Guy... You probably don't remember me do you?   I was on the show in '82.  Episode 31?  Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial?  "Crewman #6?"
Hi everybody.
This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
Simpler.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Explain -
Wait. What did you say?
Do you think I'm a fool? That the Commander does not know every bolt, every weld of his ship?
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
You have ten seconds.
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR
Because they're coming right at us.
WHAT? WH
Get oacK on their tail.
enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
Find them.
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
Find them.
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
Continue forward, sir?
Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free.
I ain't forgot about the freedom.
No.  I guess.
Yes, general.
Yes, general?
Me?  You apologizing to me?
That you would have known you can trust me.
A lot of years have gone by.
Well... I misunderstood, then.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
You, you just need a new flint, General.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
Yes, my lord.
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
No, my lord.
No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
Who's in command out there?
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
They are... friends of Congress.
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
Lafayette is a child!
Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
Partially...
Again, just to touch on a touchy subject, but... would the people accept another leader over Washington?
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
You think that?
You invented this, this...
Oh, come now...
Gag on your own invention, then.
Makes you gag.
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
Let's not over do it...
Hancock led the Boston 'tea party' because he's a goddamned tea smuggler!  He wasn't protesting inequality, he was eliminating competition.  Now, you listen to me:  we need to get a Southerner elected commander-in-chief, or the south will not fight!  What have we been struggling for all these years?  For this moment!  And, if we fail now, remember:  you stopped us!
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
Washington is perfect.  He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!
Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
Hear that, George?  Sally's actually taken to thinking of this clod of earth as her home.  And it's her first tour.  We're gratified, aren't we George?
We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.
That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
George, I'm sorry.
Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?
Well, I hear 'The People'.  Indentured servants, freed slaves... escaped slaves.  The world's castaways.  And, my fear is, in the scramble for power that's coming, you will betray them.
You hear that?
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
I say!
Yes!
All people have rights!
You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley!  That land belongs to the natives!
Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
He was not black!  He was... tan! Weathered!
For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  You look like a damned slave!  It's damned humiliating.
My daughter, I ask only...
The land here is best for grain and corn.
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
A zillion, huh? That's a lot.
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
You gave him the money?
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
Yayo. Where is he?
Where is my nephew?
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.
Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
Get in line, bro.
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
What, like that's supposed to mean something to me?
Who the fuck are you?
Get him out've here.
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
Something shouldn't be there.
By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used?
Your wife a Lakers fan?
You have a card in here?
You're an investor, is that it?
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
You live in Miami?
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it.
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
What Get Away jet?
Personally?
How'd you know he died, he tell you?
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
It's all mine.
How? By taking my money?
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
How'd you know I was here?
Who told you that?
I'm up twelve grand today.
They report it to the IRS.
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
We call you a taxi.
Maybe you don't see my sign?
It's not one of these?
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
Hm?
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Murray's dead.
You seem to feel fine about it.
What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you.  I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late.
I miss Murray, Harry.
What a spectacular view.
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Your radio check is affirmative. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coast Guard North Island Station. Over and out.
Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea. Over.

Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over.
Or what?
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it.
That cost me twenty grand at least.
No, no. You got leak.
What's this?
I thought you say Tuesday.
I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
What are you trying to say?
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
We're almost done.  Hi. Yeah... no, it's excluded. They've already paid the earnest money... well, let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through. Right, great, sounds good!
Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
Hello...
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
It's not optional!
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
I love this place... it's so - you know, "funky."
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
Well, bye you guys... CONGRATULATIONS!
I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer!
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
Listen, young lady... I know you don't like me -- I don't really care whether you do or not -- but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do.
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
May I ask what you're doing?
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
You still interested in that?
Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
Seymour does.
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.
A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
Get a job!
I'm so sorry if you were offended!
Oh, how "punk."
Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
Punk rock is over!
Didn't they tell you?
You don't know what you're talking about.
Yes.
Norman.
Hey, where are you going?
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
Fine, and how are you?
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
God, fuck you!
Well why do I care about that?
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
What?
Right.
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
They're Seymour's.
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
No problem.
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.
Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
Right, exactly!
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
It's a tampon in a teacup...
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
I am.
Do you have a check for me?
Seymour?
Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
Why don't we start with that next week?
Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so-
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
As are they all.
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
How; we don't know where they are?
I think it's been a pleasure.
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
I am a man of peace.
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
Then why do it?
You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited.
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?
Who else would hire me?  Beat you to it, didn't I?  Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift.
This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer.
You intend "sorting this out" tonight?
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off.
Nigel and I don't like each other much.
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
That's a terrible idea-
Go, now.  Such a gentleman.
-not "what if"- there will be, there always are. Which only means that our "son" and I- note my confidence- will have an excuse to come visit.
-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
I assure you we came close many times-
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
That is correct.  Nothing.
We have hunted since childhood.
I won't.
Certainly.
No.  Not that I can recall.
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
Occasionally
Oh no.
We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
Okay, that's no problem.
Didn't I do it?
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
That's quite a story.
Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.  You read me?
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
Can I help you?
So be it.  On this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother to me.
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
I command you.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
You've got to stop them.  Please!
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
You've got to do something!
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
Get on with it, counselor!
Yes.
Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
You were the one who got me in.
Like what?
I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath.
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
You were supposed to help me with this.
That's a thousand million electron volts.
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
I'd like to have a stool specimen
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
Hello, Venkman.
Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
Something good --
We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol --
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
Nine feet -- ten --
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
I'm Egon --
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
His nickname is "The Hammer."
What's the reading?
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
Good idea.
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
Who was that?
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
And it's all flowing toward the museum.
No, the slime is rising.
There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
What's the matter, dear?
Uuuuuuugh!!
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
Have I done the right thing?
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Now where are you going?
I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
Roy?  Your clock broke.
Well, thanks a lot.
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Aren't you glad we waited?
Eight o'clock?
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
No.  They're just coming to me.
Ummm -- figure eight?
Is it a star?
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
I got the Twister game for later ...
Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
Oh, Dana, it's you.
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
... I thought it was the drug store.
Oh, Dana, it's you ...
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
That would definitely explain it.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think.
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
That is one speedy mutt.
Did you see it?  What was it?
What's that got to do with it?
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
I want you to have this.
That's so romantic.
In the physical sense.
Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
Oh, that's very - unusual.
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
Oh, really?  Well, I've quit better jobs than this one, believe me.
I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
Here are tonight's calls.
What calls?
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
That's "Peck!"
Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
See!  They are using drugs.
Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
May I please see the storage facility?
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
And may I see this storage facility?
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
Are you Peter Venkman?
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
Two wavy lines?
Yes.  I don't like this.
Circle?
A square?
Wow!
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
What on earth gave you that idea?
Yes?
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
Stantz?  You okay in there?
Right.  We'll believe anything.
Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
Yeah, Judgement Day.
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
Do you believe in God?
Me, too.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
I'm serious.
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
Until your confirmation date.
At least stay for the running of the animals.  You are paying for it you know...
Caesar, ignore them.
The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.
Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.
You don't want to kill him.  If anything happens to him now you will be blamed... and he knows it. Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress.  It would take the army to break in there.  What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword. If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is he?  He's gone.  And you are a hero for awarding it.
It's because he comes off as the underdog.
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
Marcus Aurelius has died.
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
Yes, Caesar.
Yes, Caesar?
Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
I'll nose around...
I don't know...
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate.  So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?
You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
Yes, because I know they'll read it.
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
I am prepared to write anything you tell me.
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
But have never been?
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
God of passages and changes?
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
Yes!  The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over -- thanks to your father!  Now report to the Senate, Master Galen:  what is Marcus' state?
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?
That's what worries me...
My loyalties... were in doubt.
You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial?
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
The Senators admire you.
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
Servis made it through again?
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
Commodus -- listen to Narcissus, listen to the man who has never lost a battle for Rome!  You're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple!
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
Tomorrow?
I made the plume from a quail feather.
What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
I was summoned.
I can't let you do that.
My troops don't make policy.
Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis.
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
Serious stuff...
Well, we can try...
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
I certainly hope you --
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
657-2036
Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
Plastics.
Are you listening?
Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
Ben.
Ben!
Goodnight, sir.
Very good, sir.
Sir?
Hey -- I don't get it.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
Braddock -- Braddock?
I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --
Can you see me now?
Can you look through the glass.
Benjamin Braddock.
It's Benjamin.
Mrs. Robinson?
Dad -- can you listen --
I'd like to discuss this.
Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
It's a short life and a gay one...
Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns.
Splendid!
Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
Turn 'em up.
Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
Yes -- but the audience.
Well -- last night was not so good.
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
Shhh -- here he is now.
Exactly.
You're a deep one.
You see -- what we are interested in --
Shall I tell them again?
He likes to play the great man.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
Such nonsense.
You haven't time.
Why not?
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
Oh!
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
He will be on the train.
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
There was -- there was.
What -- what is it? Last night...
It is time for the performance.
Please.
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
Certainly, sir.
Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
Just one moment, sir.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
If you will wait one moment, sir.
Madam Grusinskaya's car.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
Four minutes past. Please come.
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
How is the house?
You are late. Hurry.
We will wait.
No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn.  It's his kidneys.
Right in front of the room.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
Oh, everything's the same size, same price.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Hah.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
Can't move.
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
Want a look?
Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, I want to be sure you understand that. No one gets hurt, but the law does get broken.
Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
You brought a case? Good.
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
Here you are! Two rich people!
These machines -- They're in here.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
Not much time.
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.
You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means?
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes.
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
I certainly hope not.
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
Yes, yes, but that's --
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
I'll get you a check.
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased?
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
Perk, remember?
Oh, come on, Roy.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
No?
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think?
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
What's up?
I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon.
Kaggs. Home office.
Hello.
This time...
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
Where's the five?
You're too young. You should be in school.
Scram. Go home.
I didn't teach you that.
Happy to see you looking so good.
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
Carter.
Sweet dreams, Blake.
Yes.
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
Care to join me?
That's it?
Charming.
I can be real stiff.
Only the real stiffs.
You take all your dates here. Blake?
Yeah, alright... I'll be there in ten.
The cemetery...
Where?
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
Carter.
Girl scouts.
Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
No blood on the knife.
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
That don't match either of the victim's.
One set of muddy shoe prints.
I like a woman who takes control.
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
Well, when you put it that way.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
Why am I here?
It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
Carter.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Mind if we sit down?
I'll be damned.
Doesn't look good.
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Pretty messy.  Parents have already been notified.  Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
It's Amy Kramer.
Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
Would somebody shut this guy up?
Another historical inaccuracy.
It's not historically accurate, that's all.
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
Yeah.  Oh, and they messed up your kitchen pretty good, too... Goodnight.
My office?
Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
Nothing's missing?
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
You sure?
Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
And miss the big game?  No way.
No.  Wait for the police.
Checking out your place.
Jimmy, what are you doing?
No shit.
No shit?!
I think someone broke into my house.
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
Yeah.
I'm okay.
I guess.  It's just hard to believe.
You really think Eddie killed her?
Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be quiet.
Then I'll get caught.
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
I can see that.  Why?
What are you doing here?!
Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
I can't afford to get caught.
Not me.
You stole it?
Where'd you get it?
Michael Meyers!
Linda!  He killed Linda!
Okay... thank you.
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
Can't you?
Can't you hold it?
I have to pee.
What is it?
Wait.
You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
Look, they're staring right at us.
Oh, don't be such a victim.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Let the party begin.
Very insightful.
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
Where's Shane?
Thanks!
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
You're so easy...
Shit, Linda!
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
Oh, they're so stupid... I'll just tell them he's going as a sausage casing.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
I'll pop a Benadryl.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
Shane's going as a condom.
Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
Ooooh, busted.
You're unbelievable.
Better her than me.
You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
What's this?
He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
Fuckin' A.
I did alright.
You aced it, didn't you?
He's in the bathroom.
Is Tim there?
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
Mom -- Who is this?
You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
Why?  You interested?
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
Pig.  What the hell happened this time?
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
He do that to you?
What if it's Kara?
Answer what?
Aren't you gonna answer that?
Then they can watch.
What if your parents come home?
Guess so ...
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
We can light our own tree at home.
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work.
Happy fuckin' Halloween.
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
Whatever happened to women in back?
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.
Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
Danny!!!
Mommy!!!
I promise.
Promise?
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
Mommy, I'm scared.
Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
You can't expect us to stay here --
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
Okay ... But just for tonight.
No, Mom -- keep it on!
Like what?
He says things.  Bad things.
You've been watching too much TV.
But I've seen him!
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
The voice man!  He's here!
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
You knew, didn't you, John?  You knew.
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
What is it this time?
You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.
See what I'm talkin' about?
Kids are what's ruining this country. Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn respect.
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
God ... this can't be true.
What should I do?
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
What makes you think he'll come here again?
Who are you?
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
It's not working!
Come on!
Wait a minute ...
What now?!
Kara, no!
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
He's gone.
Where's the baby?!
Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
Danny?!  Danny!
To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
Where are you going?
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
Halloween.
Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
It's a rune ... Thorn.
It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or --
Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family.  Here.  Look at this.
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
Here.  Let me try.
God, what's wrong with him?
Him.
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
You stay away from him!
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
My, God!  What have you done to him?
Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
No!!!
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
Who else knew I had the baby?!
No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
Won't you please join our club? Please?
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
I'm only ten years old.
Thought you were another wife, maybe.
Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake.  I don't really know him.
Never mind.  It's a dumb theory.  I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexual...but alcohol.  Peace.
Ja?
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
That is sad.
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
Premature ejaculation.
Because he was cruel?
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Yes.
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
I heard you were looking for me.
Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
You bet! "The Harold Ryan Fan Club." Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, "Go take a flying--
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
Yes, we do.
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
That you may discuss with the girl of your choice in the privacy of your room.
What we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room. It's twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars an hour. Anything else you desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tips are allowed. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.
What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
You mean I'm black?
Two officers have been assigned to the case. I can't keep them on indefinitely, but we'll go through every lead.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
Keep me informed of what he's up to. You help me, I'll help you.
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?

Hello. You want some information?
Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
Yes. I think it'll look better.
Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
Overpowering?
Sam?
Pavonine. It's the same tint as the stripe in the fabric.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
No, that would be much too overpowering.
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
What plan?
What is going on?
What?
I called every L.A. hotel. The Holiday Inn gave this as a referral number. Your office said you had no business in New York, so I figured you had come out here.  What's happening, Jake? What are you doing? Nobody's heard from you. Anne's worried sick. We didn't know if you were dead or alive.
Jake?
You should come around more often. You haven't been around for weeks. Anne complains she doesn't see you anymore.
How's your business, Jake?
I'll come with you. Let me pack some things.
Is Marsha there?
What happened?
What is it, Jake?
Anne wants to make sure you come over for dinner Sunday. With Kristen gone you'll be all alone.
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
Look, I know this chick Niki. She works at Les Girls. She would know. Honest.
I don't know.
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids.
Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff.
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
Hey man.
No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents.
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
I don't know nothing, man.
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
I don't know what you're talking about.
They're all about the same. You want something?
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
It's fifty cents admission. It's applicable to a purchase.
Fifty cents admission.
Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
In other words, you want to get laid?
What exactly do you have in mind?
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
Film making can be pretty expensive...
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
Hold it, mister.
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
What does that do?
Well, a boy goes like this, see.
Com'on, tell me.
You never heard of that?
What's that?
You ever play Chicken?
I don't know.
He asked me. You going with anybody?
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
To anybody.
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
Do you really think Kristen is just a runaway?
I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
I'm worried about Jake.
Oh.
Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
At least I improved myself. What's up?
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
No.
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
You working in San Diego now?
Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
Eh, Poli Sci?
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
And what are you studying?
Yes, I am.
You are at the University, Candy?
How do you do. I'm Mrs. Chasen. Come in.
Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.
Lady! Be quiet.
Wait here.
Where are the papers?
Then whose name is it registered in?
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Is this your shovel?
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
Out!
None of that, lady.
Okay, lady. Out.
Lady, let me get this straight.
Your tree.
Took it?
Isn't this your vehicle?
Could I see your registration?
How long have you been driving?
Come again.
Yes.
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred...
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
I'm a file clerk.
Edith was just telling me about her job.
I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
Not very.
How interesting.
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
And what do you do, my dear?
Fern. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance.
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
What kind of a car is it?
This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
What do you want?
This is insane.
Harold!
You don't care! "Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!" Listen to me...
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
A sunflower?
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
To whom?
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
Well, I want you to go to bed directly after dinner. You know how susceptible you are to colds. Harold has always been a delicate child. Even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally prone to illness - Harold, dear, eat up your beets...
Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?
Like a tea ceremony?
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
Oh, he's in the Army. I do so like the military, don't you? Those uniforms make men look so virile. I did "What Price Glory?" in summer stock. I played Charmaine - with a French accent.
Oh, is this your father?
Oh, I studied the guitar. I had to give it up. Gave me calluses on my fingers. As an actress I can't afford to have a tarnished instrument.
Do you play?
Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
Can't complain.
Oh yes. That's fine.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
But wait...
Well, I didn't.
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
Yes.
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Time to play.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
We have no more surprises.
We've always been here.
It's different for us.
Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
Oh, I do. I do.
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
You knew?
I knew you'd come.
Frank.
Julia.
Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
'Fraid not, baby. He belongs here. With me. We're the same. Brothers. Equal and opposite. Pure appetite. Pure banality. Too much feeling. None at all.
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
Shit. Bull. Shit.
Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
I knew you'd come back.
Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
I want to go back!
It certainly is.
It's coming.
She certainly has.
She's done it.
I know.
It's a beautiful dress...
No. You look...
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
Yes... Yes. You look...
It's been Hell.
I'm scared.
I've got to finish it.
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
I... remember.
Nonsense, I...
What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
Then why are you here?
Who?
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.
Yeah.
Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap.
Oh, excuse me...
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
They were over here, Professor.
Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any.
Is he serious??
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
See what??
I need to touch it to "see"...
Oh, right --
Remind me why I keep doing this.
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
You were burned by some organic acid.
No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
Red, I found something --
Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
You mean, outside... with her.
Story of my life.
It doesn't say --
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
-- Hound of resurrection?
hound of resurrection --
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
From where??!!
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
The freak in the gas mask --
Oh, I'll bet you have.
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
Three days too late for that one, "professor."
I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
Here. You'll need one of these.
Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
You are a Catholic??
In private, if you don't mind...
What is it?
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
I think that is its hand.
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
No. It was red. Bright red.
What the hell was that? An ape?
That makes him more than a hundred --
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
C'mon -- Rasputin??
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Do you believe in hell?
No. It's not.
It's almost over!!
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
He's just going through a phase --
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
I thought you liked being on TV.
Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
It's her choice --  She's human --
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
Don't look! Turn around.
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
I worry about you.
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
Son. About Rasputin --
A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.
Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
You're doing fine.
Did he, now?
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence "Abe" Sapien.
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
We're on the move.
Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
Well, you did break out --
Manning says I'm too soft on you --  The candy. Give him the candy.
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
She's dead.
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
Thank you.
You never, ever light a cigar that way.
You call that thing a cigar??
I'm in charge. We go back!
-- should go back. Now!
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
Each of us gets a belt.
We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
Marco...
I like that...
Red, I --
I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
No. Myers is taking me.
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
Goodnight.
No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
You better have that looked at.
Hit me.
You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
What -- ?
Coffee's warming me up.
Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
I know.
A brute.
Cocky.
He's just pushy.
Doesn't sounds like him.
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
Two steps back, please.
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
What's the problem?
Oh, sod you.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Will you sign for the bed?
We're leaving.
Want to buy a bed?
It's my lucky day.
Lucky man.
Oh.
Got her mother's looks.
That your daughter?
Do you really need this bed, lady?
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
We'll get you a phone as long as you promise to stay put.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
You were holding onto it like grim death.
First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
You took quite a beating. You must lie down.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
Please. Get back into bed.
Too much drink. Better empty my bladder.
Oh Christ.
You know you are. Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on.
You know, you're very beautiful.
Why don't you do the same?
Yeah, why don't I?
First time for everything.
I suppose not.
What's going on?
This isn't the bedroom.
No personal details?
No, not much.
Is this your place ?
That's more like it.
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
Well, isn't it?
I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.
I suppose that's right.
You know it's not often I... you know...
Oh?
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
Plain soda?
What are you drinking?
I wonder, maybe...
Drinking alone.
Not much fun, is it?
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
Try me.
Of course. This isn't a prison you know.  Look if you'd prefer to tell ME what happened, instead of a policeman --
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
What a pretty tune.
I won't be a moment.
I'll get the doctor.
You're awake. Good girl.
I beg your pardon?
That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
Really.
I don't know.
I have a television.
Well what about the new Echo --
They always seemed...
I have all of the others.
What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
Why not?
Great.  Can I have it then?
I'm looking for a record for my daughter.  For her birthday.  "I Just Called To Say I Love You." Do you have it?
Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more.  In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.  Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.  And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself?  Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.  A little sunnier.  Sparkier.  I don't know.  You know what people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation.
There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Hey Rob.
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Maybe I should talk to him.
You look upset.
Laura?  Are you okay?
Think about it, Rob.
So shall we leave it at that then?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Think about it, Rob.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
Well I don't know what happens now, apart from you meet someone, you move in, she goes.  You meet someone, you move in, she goes.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
I knew this was going to happen.
And after that?
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
Well call her mother.
What do you mean?  Where did she go?
Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...
How's the store?
Everything all right?
Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
What's the name of your label?
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
I'm Vince.
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
Records are those big round black things, right?
No, we...
Well we don't.
Naw.  Those are for us.
I warned you.
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't get the taste out of her mouth.
He'd want to know about all this.
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
Find the father.  That should clear things up.
How old is Richard?
Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.
Maybe he's hiding from something.
You're the expert.
Huh?
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore.
This one came unassembled.
Happy birthday.
You're very macabre.
That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
Carl Smith.
There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The young lady just couldn't make it through labor.  Never even saw her son.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
No.
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
He was unsual.
Would you like more tea?
Anything in Maryland is close.
Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
-Okay okay.
This is against the rules.
Call your mother.  You never call her.
Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
You're never "just curious".  You've met my neice, Brenna.
Forget it.
Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
You always were hard to impress.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
Good way to lose your job.
It's that important?
You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
Why?
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
-Auditorium nostrum-
-Luceat ei-
-Et lux perpetua-
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
Do what you must.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
Please not be touching me, Conor.
Me father has taken back my hand.
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
Some think not.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
I have no future husband.
David.
Kiss me.
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
Something pretty.
Oh please.  Another one.
So sure?
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
Finish yours?
Finish your prayers?
Romirez is dust.
Romirez understood.  Not you.
I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
You're wrong.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
No doubt.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
Not so scared.
It's all we have.
Tradition.
State of grace and all that.
Certainly not me.
Who am I deceiving?
Not likely.
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
Won't get it.  We are a sacrifice.  A diversion.
We need more time.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
Complete your inspection?
I had no choice.
You see Major?  You are not so different...
Either you are with me or against me.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Do not turn your back on me.
Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.
Don't threaten me, Private.
Stay out of it.
We must talk.
It never changes, Major.
It can be different.  It must be.
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
Then it is time two of us did. You are very young.  I was once young.  I can help.
We have no understanding.
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
If you wish to play games, Major.
Equals?
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
You seem to understand a great deal.
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
Second musketeer.
What is your position?
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
Mulet.
Your name?
He's a MacLeod.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
Must he go?
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
Have you time for some- thing to eat?
Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
Your father must be smart.
Where did you learn that?
Thanks.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
You'd think he'd had practice.
Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
Figure she's with him?
We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
None of this would be happening if you hadn't run...
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
The last four.
Smith.  Carl Smith.
I don't know.
You don't run as hard, MacLeod. You just don't run as hard anymore.
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
I knew his great-grandfather.
I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
-Since you last saw me.
He always did.
Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
It is the gathering, my friend.  The settling of old scores.
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
Head still secure to the neck.
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
Spare a chair?
Get up.
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
It's all we have.
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
This isn't done.  Get up.
As you wish.
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
MACLEOD!
I do hope she enjoys a good show.
Friend of yours?
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
Long time.
Yes laddie, I have her.
Give me an address where I can forward Miss Cart- wright's head.
I want you to come to me.
We have some unfinished business.
They were Steven, they were.  It's been a miracle it has.  He lasted right through and healed.  No one in the village has ever seen anything like it.  Ever.
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
You're a kind man to be sure.
I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
Just your pappy scared some.
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
Morning Mr. North
I'll send them right up.
The resemblance is amazing.
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
Oh yes, more than enough.
When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
Why don't you fellows get your own news?
Open this door!
What's the idea of locking this?
Well, congratulations! Good luck!
What doing?
Are you back?
Hildy!
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
I got my rhyming dictionary in --
Sort of a Jack London style?
Seventy-five.
No. Roy. Roy V.
What?
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
How do you mean?
Excuse me, I just want to --
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
Let me out! Let me out of here!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!
You know you did!
What's that -- what's that?
I always have both.
Sure, boss.
You know me. The shirt off my back.
Who do you want?
Anything you want, Boss.
Western an' Thirty-fourth.
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
He's on my phone. He just called me.
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
Walter!
Let's see the money.
It's a deal. Let me up.
How much?
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
I think it is.
No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over.
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
They're always after me for interviews.
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
Point the gun at me!
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
We know what you're up to.
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
What a chase!
So long, Hildy.
I'll call.
Good coffee, isn't it?
That's all right.
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
Little rum in yours, too?
I can't complain.
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
No, I couldn't do that.
Yeah. But I --
Earl Williams. The reprieve.
You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
Five hundred dollars.
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
I can't.
Now, Hildy --
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
All right, Judge.
Was I? The driver got knocked cold.
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
We run smack into a police patrol. You know what I mean? We broke it in half!
I'm telling you!
My name is Louis Peluso.
Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
I'll go right after it.
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
Phone for you, Hildy.
Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
Okay.  Forget it.
Okay, Hildy.  Well, we can't get any official statement --
Did you get that, Hildy?
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
You fight it cut.
What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?
Huh?
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
First you got to sign a receipt.
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
That man there!
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
Hey --
What's the idea?
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
They'll get him! They'll get him!
There's somethin' funny going on around here.
What's that?
What do you mean?
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
They're not human!
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
Here's the picture of my wife.
They wouldn't take it.
You can't bribe me!
Is it hard?
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
Pinkus.
But how do I know...?
This puts me in a peculiar hole.
Yeah?
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
No, I don't think so.
I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
You mean here in the city?
The what?
Who? Me?
Forty dollars.
Huh?
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
What's your hurry?
Say, Hildy...
Get the cops, somebody.
Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
Look out!
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.
It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job.  Take it away, Fred Wilson!
She and Mollie were talking.
The door was locked.
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
What's he want?
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right.
I give that marriage six months.
Baldwin -- his name is.
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
Apparently so.
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
It's true.
You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
Only till they get you into the local school.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
Very well, Grandpa.
Give him the you-know-what.
I concede I was insistent, but how the Devil...
But Grandpa, you said...
This is going too far, young man.
Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you.
Why?
Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
I know.
That was a googly!
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
Never let a rat creep up on you.
Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
Can I try?
So it was. Sheila. This boy will go far.
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
What's that?
They'll have to go to a shop to buy a map, stupid. Then they'll give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay tork.
Won't they have maps?
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.
OK. You're in.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Bloody.
Bloody.
Sod.
Sod.
Bugger off.
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
I only know one.
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
Say them.
Yes.
Do you know any swear words?
I don't mind.
You want to join our gang?
They're not.
My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."
Who told you that?
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
What's that?
I know a secret.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
I never was.
Looking for shrapnel.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
Yes, she did, didn't she?
No, she didn't.
Pauline's mum got killed.
Liar. Mummy keep still and Daddy moves on top of her. That's what they do when they know how.
Pauline.
Who with?
It's easy. I've done it.
I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
We thought it was poison.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
You do it. You're a girl.
Ask her yourself.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
Could.
You couldn't.
Would.
You wouldn't.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
Well, for the baby, really.
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
It's Canadian. Where'd you get it?
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
It's not the same.
Can't we just see the end?
...and six...
...and four and five...
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
I did see them. I did.
You said that last year, Dad.
It's like telling fibs.
But Dad, It's the News.
Crocodiles! Aah!
Who pays for them?
Wow!
What's that?
Please yourself.
I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
I don't know?
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
Didn't you feel the house rock? You must have seen all those shell bursts.
Boy, that was some air-raid.
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
I mean, no suspenders. They just kinda' disappear up your ass.
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
It was great for me, how was it for you.
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
How are we going to cope?
Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
Or what?
Is it peace in out time?
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
And...and...Henry Chapman's girl, was it Thelma? No, I can see those cornflower eyes...I've lost your name, my sweetness.
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
Am I? Maybe I am.
Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
It's not fair on them. It's selfish to keep them with you.
Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
Who's your Daddy!
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
No, I told you...
Baby! Stop!
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
What about R.J.?
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
Hey, wait take this.
Holy crap, thanks!
Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five dollars.
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
I don't.
I don't drive cross country.
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
Enough talk, write.
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
How's about you give me those same directions.
Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
Is that all... think real hard.
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
And...
Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around... asking stupid questions.
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
Hmmmmmmmmm?
Come on, get with the facts.
You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
What I need are some answers.
Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?
Fuck your grandmother.
I hear ya.
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
Goddamn.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
What?
Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
That kid is one horny retard.
Fascinating.
Yeah, he's all hot on her after he found some of his dad's old nudie books hidden in the basement. He keeps 'em taped inside his school workbook.
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
Hmmmmm.
I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky, love June.
He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started. I don't think Earl ever meant to harm us... but Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
He should be back in a couple hours.
That's nice.
No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
Well, just promise me you'll be careful... alright, alright see ya soon... good-bye.
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
Yep, I found something.
You find something, Georgie?
God damn.
Yep, I suppose it is.
That's the understatement of the year.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
Not yet.
Recover any bodies?
Yeah, no mercy here.
Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
What'd we here, Georgie?
Yes, sir.
Open up the trunk.
Huh?
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
Keys.
What'd ya got there?
Aw, honey you know I can't do that.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
Firefly.
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
What do they call you, sweety?
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner.
I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.
Oh really, well I hope something changes your mind some day.
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
Oh, it's real... as real as I want it to be, mamma...  ...look, see the magic in my brush strokes.
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
Let's go see.
Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?
Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
Thank you.
Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all.
Please, just a minute.
I um... no, I don't think so...
Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen her, sorry.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
Well hello, officer.
Well, go get her.
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Wait, I want to say good-bye.
Get in... now!
Yes! I'm the one who beats you when you're bad...
Who's your Daddy!
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy...
Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
What should I do?
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
I don't know. I only saw one.
What! God damn, how many?
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
Grampa... watch the language.
Right.
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
Call Wydell.
Jesus Christ.
Shit... fuck procedure.
Tell it to my daughter.
I ain't got a warrant.
We gotta break it open.
Over here, inside the smokehouse.
Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
Shhhh... you hear that?
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
Where we headed?
Turn up this road.
My Denise is a smart girl, she wouldn't do anything stupid, and her boyfriend, he always seemed like a good kid.
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.
Fit the profile?
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
George Willis...  ...any leads?
Hey.
I pray to God there is.
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
What about the body you found?
Dr. Satan?
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
That's it?
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Willis?
We found one.
Over.
Excuse me for a second.
Wydell.
Right...  ...come on.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.
Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
That must be him.
I guess not.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
Call the chief... We found 'em.
Plates match.
What.
Aw, fuck.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
I always favored the Hulk.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
Your Spidey senses tingling.
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
Right.
Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
It's going famously, son, famously!
Tell him, Harold.
Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up.
Tell him, Harold.
And think about what you've done.
And?
No "buts." Go to your room now.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
You're fucked up, Lila.  Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake.
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.
No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
I'm going to miss you.
With pleasure.
Done!
Let's get you out of here. Come stay with me until you get your strength back.  Free electrolysis, if you want it! We'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
Nathan told my brother.
Lila, I want to help you.
Please, honey, let me in.
Lila, it's Rosie.
Stand on a stepladder sometimes.
Yeah. My brother told me.
Be still my crotch.
Oh?
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
No. I married a midget.
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
Yeah?
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
Yeah. Says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother. And according to my brother Nathan's abormally close with his mother.
My brother says he likes you, too.
So?
Yeah, well my brother is his shrink.
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
My brother is discreet.
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
Loves animals. Loves you.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
You still in the market for a real boy?
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
Progress!
And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
Yes... Derek.
I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man.
Wait!
It's open...  What'll you have?
Right.
Check!
You want a chaser?
About sixty, seventy bucks.
Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
What do you guys sell?
Comin' in or goin' out?
Pittsburgh?
Boys just passing through?
Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
You well-heeled, partner?
Want some free advice?
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
What kind of straight pool game you like?
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
What's your game? What do you shoot?
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
Ten dollars.
Half and a dollar.
Oh man, you're way out of our league.
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
Yeah, I'm quittin'.
You better not miss, friend.
Heads.
Okay, friend. You're on.
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
Okay.
Try me.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
How much are you ahead?
You quittin' too?
Okay, friend.
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
Hi.
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
What?
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
It was at Diane's party in Malibu and I had just broken up with Todd and I was loaded for bear, any man who had the nerve to come at me -- watch out.  So you come sauntering in -- you know that saunter you do. That watch out, baby, here comes Mr. Smooth thing.
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
Round back.
You built things.
So, what do you do?
You got that right.
Only got one kind.
Need some gas?
Good night.
It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
George, you're acting very strangely.
Yes -- but ...
You did?  Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried.
Where's your car?
What happened to you?  Who was that?
I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
You don't have to.  The school bus stops right outside here, at 7:30. I've got to run.
I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
About what?
May I ask why?
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
Oh, I can't remember.  But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed.
It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself.
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
What?
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
Your father asked you a question.
George, where have you been?
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
I know.  But you have a full day of school tomorrow --  You, too.
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
They're from out of state.  Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.
Oh?
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
Cool.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
It's really nice of you to help us.
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
Think nothing of it, Spanky.
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
Punched the President? Oh my god.
I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.
What'd I say?
David, you're drunk.
This I can see.
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
You punched the President in the face?
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
You can do that?
It's perfect the line is busy?
You try Martin?
Spunky?
Not listed, huh?
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
What the hell is that?
All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David. They want HBO, they'll call you.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
Three, four. Move on. It's not healthy.
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.
So think already.
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
This is ridiculous.
It had been deemed classified.
Mr. President, we must launch. A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!
That's impossible...
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
It's... slowing down, Sir.
Well, er... it's slowing down.
No Sir. Definitely not.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
Oh. Sorry.
Really? Ballet?
So, what do you do for a living?
Was his father stationed here?
Your son.
Stevie... I can't...
We're already over Mach 2!
I didn't even see them fire!
Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
I hear you.
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
But I gave you some this morning.
That'd be cool!
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
I don't need it.
You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your medicine.
It's all fuzzy.
Stop it.
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
How' he doing?
There's a group heading south, they said there's a hospital just a couple hours away. I think we should follow them.
We should leave too.
I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
They let you out?
Damn it, he was doing you a favor. You know how hard it is to find someone who doesn't think you're completely crazy? What are we supposed to do now? Huh? Where are we supposed to go now?
You sure?
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Mr. President?
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left to defend.
I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
What the hell's going on?
But, Mr. President...
We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me.
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
Die.
Peace? No peace.
Many worlds...
Here... now.
Air... water... your "sun."
The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
Papers, sir. Got it here.
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
And I am his.
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
You are on your own?
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
Tapestries?
Are you expected?
I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me.
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
A long time to wait.
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
But, Indy --
I'll take the camels.
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them.
Get that camel out of the way!
In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border.
Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
My name is Kazim.
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
My soul is prepared. How's yours?
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
No.
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi.
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot.
Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.
Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
The British worry so about their Empire -- it makes us feel like well- cared-for children.
Just a routine inspection tour.
Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".
Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
Miss Scott panicked?
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.
This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
Of course. Admittedly, it's taken time. Britain's controlled India for almost two hundred years now.
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
Charming.
Interested in local curios?
Who?
What?
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
I believe we're being called to dinner.
I sense the fumes of opium in all this. Perhaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai.
Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
You understand what he tells us?
Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones...
There, you see, Captain. A rock!
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
Their stories are just fear and folklore.
There are no stories anymore.
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.
Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?
I would say you look rather lost.  But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home...
At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.
You have insulted my son.
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
Nee chin lie how ma?
Dr. Jones.
What?
Read you loud and clear, Indy!
Behind you!
This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
Why they glow like that?
What does it mean, Indy?
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
Yeah, that's what happened...
Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! Then he talk in this real scary voice!
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
What you look at, Indy?
Indy, look!
I ride with you, Indy?
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
Indy?
Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
No, the stones are mine!
Give me the stones!
You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
You do not believe me? You will, Dr. Jones. You will become a true believer.
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
Long ago -- before my father's father.
No. We pray to Krishna to help us find the stone. It was Krishna who made you fall from sky -- so you can got to Pankot Palace. To find sivalinga -- and bring back to us.
It is why Krishna brought you here.
They came from Palace and took sivalinga from out village.
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.
You will go to palace there.
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
Willie, come on!
What for?
They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
I get it!
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
JOE What abilities...?
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
They have stolen state property.
It's a long story.
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
I take the last chip in with me. I use it, to control re-enlargement, from inside.
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
Me.
Who's our little man?
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
Impossible.
She found out what she could ...and delivered him here.
Rene?
I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
**?!!
You've cut your hair?
You didn't tell us you were coming?
It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
Bit expensive, sir.
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
Sir?
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
What Job?
Ah...no sir. He was here for a job interview.
He work for us?
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
Surveilliance on them all.
We'll have to let them go.
We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?
You have nothing...
They took the tapes.
Surveillance Cameras?
Enough ROmance.
Yes?
Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you a fee. Make up for what you lost on the tour.
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
That crazy guy?
What are you doing here, where've you been?
Join us.
Who is your friend?
And...you know Jan Gruner?
What brings you here?
And how do you service foreigners.
You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
That name's familiar.
We insist.
Sue who?
Was quite excited, when he came in...
Been hearing voices.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Al?
Who?
Why would we want to hurt you?
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
Take the card.
Joe.
Look, we'll bring your car home. just take it easy until the effects wear off. You need anything, just call this number.
You'll feel better
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
Don't you want to get out?
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
We're here.
Well...
Fine. You look fine.
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
Right.
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
When you remember...
When you do...
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
You may not remember things.
It may have been affected.
Your memory.
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
Just give me the keys.
You may you find all the solitude you want.
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
I noticed you staring.
Yessir...very good sir.
Ahhh. Good choice, sir.
Sir?
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
Sir?
I didn't say anything.
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
Nothing.
Nothing.
What's what?
I don't know.
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
Excuse me?
What could you find in this place?
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
Is there anything else?
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
Mom...what are you doing here?
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
Yes.
Tear it apart?
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
Could I have it, please.
Just one. The back up.
It will be fine. You have another.
It is?
It's alright.
The experiment. The danger...
Why not?
You can't take that.
Why?
Wait.
No?
It doesn't hurt.
It will.
It'l be alright.
Ow?...
Perfectly.
The other working.
Yes.
This the only spare?
Thank you.
Right there.
What about Al...
So we better get started.
It'l take months.
Whoever took it does.
Look, nobody knows we did it.
Too much.
What does he know?
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
Poor bastard.
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
In the backyard.
I heard them.
What's that outside, Daddy?
Can I go over to Janeane's house?
I'll take some.
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
Okay.
For reading.
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Hi, Daddy.
There's Dad, on TV.
Mom.
Yeah.
He's into kind of little cars, that...
Three hours.
We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
Lowell?
Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
Are you all right?
I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
What? Forget it.
Monday.
I'll be there.
Sure. Where?
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
The sub-heading is, "Brown & Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic." It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle-blower."
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking for you...
Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
Sure.
What was that about?
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
Alright, alright.
I don't know what he was thinking.
What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
What does that do?
Okay.
Oh, I love that stuff.
What are you cooking?
Maybe later.
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
And what are you implying?
So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave...
We're doing this with or without you, Lowell. If you like, I can assign another producer to edit your show...
I'm afraid you are.
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview.
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
What caliber is your gun?
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
Okay.
What about you, you got a crew already?
Hey, Lowell.
Mike... Mike... Mike...
Well, at the end of the day... because of your segment... the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company... could own CBS.
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
Are you sure?
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
Call me back in ten.
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Hi, baby.
Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.
Hey, Lowell.
No.  I'm assuming the cave-in begins with the threat of litigation from Big Tobacco. Are we talking... are we talking Brown & Williamson, here?
Lowell?
Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
You're sure you want to do this?
Okay.  Lowell?
Hello?
"60 Minutes," the television show?
"60 Minutes"?
Did you say Berman?
Who's calling?
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
Is it too late?
...you fucked me!
All right. See you...
...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
Alright?
It would be better if he called us.
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
That's right...
I'll call you then.
Alright.
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
How have you liked your stay?
Coffee?
I can't say that!
He doesn't seem to be listening...
What?
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
Where you staying now?
What do you mean there is no family?
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
What are you talking about?
You called me.
Well, what do you really think, though?
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
Just give me an example...
Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
Right.
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
Object!
It acts as a...
Object to the form!
It acts as a drug on the body?
Object to the form of the question!
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
Hello.
I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
That's why we hire scientists...
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
Yeah, I know you do...  You know, I came up through sales. One of the reasons I was a great salesman, was I never made a promise I couldn't keep.  I knew that if I ever broke my promise I'd suffer the consequence...
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?
They hate each other --
He --
Well, I wouldn't say --
You're in a rush.
Is that... one person?
Who do you want me to kill?
Who's the pigeon?
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!
Who's the pigeon?
That's his lawyer.
No...
Mr. Dumbarton.
Sustained.
Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.
Mr. Massey?
We rest, Your Honor.
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
Uh... poetry recitation.
Grounds?
Objection, your honor!
He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.
What is your husband's profession?
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
It sounded like a bell.
Oh boy. If he only knew.
Is Tong older than Ming?
You said 'yes' didn't you?
You're vulnerable.
I begged you to have a baby!
Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
Why do you think she did it?
You like kids.
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
So who'd you hire?
Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.
He was right, wasn't he?
Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
You used his credit card.
Is this a lover?
Who's that?
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.
You ruined my life you sonofabitch. Gimme those.
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
Wait. I know you.
He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
She's here now.
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
Mr. Massey --
When you have a moment.
We've outlined a settlement...
That's attorney client privilege.  Sorry, Miles. But as a great and clever man once said, What's good for the goose --
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
And it's good!
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
...arty farty!
Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
Oh brother. Here we go.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Ha Ha.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
That's delusional.
My client has ruled that out.
So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
When she was a tiny girl? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? She never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? She always said --  "When I grow up, I want to be divorced."
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.
Hi, Sweetie.
Mother?
We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
And only two are hers.
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
Maybe next time.
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
Three is not Farrow.
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sirshe sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
Oh, no, sir. No different than
Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
Yes, sir?
If you really mean it, I will.
Why should she? After all
might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I
What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?
What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
Lower the boats!
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one
Yessir. She refuses them all.
She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today.
What happened?
Yes, of course.
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye.
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that
Yes, sir.
What would you like to have me do?
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
You talk as if
Why; naturally, I
You've made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
But it's King Westley on the phone.
They're the finest detective agency in the country, sir.
They're practically all the same, sir.
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
Thanks.
I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess.
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New Yorkand if we didn't go, she might lose it.
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
But the lady says
"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
. . . turn."
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn As life's corners I . . .
Phone for help?  We're right in the middle of nowhere. There isn't a town within ten miles of here.
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
Maybe they doand maybe they don't.
Yeah?
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
Hey, whadda you tryin' to dokid me?
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
What do you think you're doing!
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller.
Whadda you want!
Not interested.
Yep! The Walls of Jericho.
I just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish.  If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it, what's all the shootin' for, will you tell me? After all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed  Right now, that hay feels pretty good to you, doesn't it? Sure it does. 'Cause you were tiredand it's the only thing around.
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Whome?  Want to see me?
Come here, you little fool!
sixseveneightnine
ONETWOTHREEFOURFIVE
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
Whatever you say, darling.
You bet we did.
How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
Sorry, Miss.
Eight o'clock tonight.
Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
Left twenty minutes ago.
In about fifteen minutes.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything.  Kinda surprised, huh? It's just like I told you, Zeke. They ain't married a'tall . . .
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Yesif he is your husband.
What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady
I'm hungry.
What time is it?
Yes?
Oh, by the waywhat's your name?
Oh, excuse me.
How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
The dame's too smart for him.
Yeah!
I said, the old man's screwy!
What's 'at?
The old man's screwy!
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Up yonder. See the lights?
Any of your passengers want a place to sleepthere's an auto camp up yonder a piece.
Bridge washed outaround Dawson.
Yes.
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Mr. Gordon
I ain't got a hat.
ain't got a hat
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
I dunno.
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
A trumpet?
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
What do you reckon that's for?
Yeah?
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
Yeah.
Funny couple, ain't they?
Collect?
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub ofof"
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is"  No, do you really?
Yes, Ma.
Zeke.  Git!
Yeah.
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Not a minute!
Yeah, you'll have to git .
Thenyou'll have to git !
Oh!!
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
See that. They're gone!
That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.  Come on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it.
Who?
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
I don't trust him.
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
Mebbe.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
There you gotrustin' people again. How many times did I tell you
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
"Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23.  Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc..."
Without them, it's going to be near impossible, chief, to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA.  We got the same problem with the governors. All of them.  Reagan in California won't give us Brading, Ohio refuses Orville Townsend, Texas on Arcacha, and Nebraska on Sandra Moffet.
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks.  If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
Get home my ass.  We're going to the office, have another drink.  I want some company tonight.
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
Yes, you are.  Look we know Oswald didn't pull that trigger.  Castro did.  But if that comes out, there's gonna be a war, boy - millions of people are gonna die.  That's a hell of a lot more important than Jim Garrison.  Goddammit, look at me when I talk to you!  You're too goddamn self- opinionated, now shut up.  If you got a brain in that thick skull of yours, listen to me.  Listen real hard.
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Bill.
Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
...well the party got crazier and crazier, one of those, y'know "beatnik" type things.
Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.
Yeah, strange guy.  Dave introduced him as...
...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...
Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim.
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
Why?
I did.
Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
...Oswald?
Oh yes, there were admirals - and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the Army you just follow orders, and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told - as I recall it was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon General of the Navy - we were specifically told not to discuss the case.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
No.
I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
I had the cause of death.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
That's our case!
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
What?
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
I'm scared.
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
Are we going away, Daddy?
Daddy!  Where have you been?
A rhinoceros.  Can I stay up another hour?
Dad, look what I drew.
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
...you heard echoes.
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
I want the truth.
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
No, you don't!
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
Four to six.
How many shots you say you heard?
These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
Well... yeah.
Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
Honey, another one of these.  This one's as weak as cricket pee-pee. Yessir, you mark my words, Jim, Vietnam's gonna cost Johnson '68 and it's gonna put that other varmint Nixon in - then watch your hide, 'cause there ain't no offramps on a freeway to Hell!
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
Don't get me started on that.  Those Warren Commission fellows were pickin' gnat shit out of pepper.  No one's gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore.
Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.
No, it can't!
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
Are they?  Why would they?
Some people would say you're paranoid.
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
Sure sounds like he's winning.
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
She's the best damn witness we have!
Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
Nonsense.  You should be in a job where you can make decisions that have impact, affect the world.  Here you're trying to climb up the steep side of Mount Everest.
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
That's all you've had all this time?
How many men are working with you on this?
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
Splendid, love to see them.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
Uh huh.
Do you walk home?
Yes.
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
And how tall are you?
Six.
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
That sounds fun.
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
Virginia.
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Yes?
Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. Chief Justice, you have a lost cause. All I want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it to me. Because as it stands now - and the truth serum - how do you pronounce it - Pentothal - whatever it is. They will not give it to me, because I want to tell the truth... And then I want to leave this world.
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
What are they?
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
When are you going back to Washington, sir?
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
Oh, that's not a problem.
Not a problem.
Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit.
Can I help you?
Won't forget?
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
Yes, Max, I understand.
I understand.
I understand.
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
I know. That's why I went.
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.
And cooperate? You might get probation.
I beg your pardon?
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
He say is a surprise.
Yes'm.
Sometimes every day, for a while.
Most of the times.
He say we like the same thing as married.
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
Cops can't locate him, huh?
Have fun.
Watcha gonna see?
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
I'll give you his beeper.
He's around.
He ain't here right now.
Cherry Bail Bonds.
Dream on!
It's all been a dream.
Remember?
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
What isn't happening?
Then what are you doing here?
What are you then?
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
Where do you want to go?
Well, how do I look?
What do you want?
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
Hiya Jake. That was some dance.
It's fun.
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
Are you all right?
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
Me, too.
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.
You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
Grass never did that to me.
Yeah, ever since that ...
Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?
Hey, you're talkin' about Paul. Who'd want to hurt him?
How do you know?
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
LET GO!
Daddy. Let go.
You're hurting me!
Daddy!
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Short? It's ended.
You know, you got a strange line here.
You see this line here? It's your life line. Here's where you were born. And this is where you got married. You're a married man, huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.
You have an unusual hand.
Don't go.
Wait ... Daddy.
Mom, it's ...
It's cold.
There was a bang.
Daddy, what was that noise?
I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay?
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
You mind? I'm eating, huh?
You need ... a doctor.
Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
Ah! Well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they?
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here?
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
What else did he say, Jake?
What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange.
That was set. I'm tellin' you.
But the paper ...
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
Why do you say that?
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
You think they're connected?
Excuse me a minute. I'll be right back.
He say what they looked like?
How long had that been going on?
What do you mean, demons?
I say you should get a shrink.
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
Not me, buddy.
Dr. Carlson's dead?
Shit!
It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over.
I'venever understood you, you know that? You were by far the best pupil I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. Who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons. Maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob. Nothing.
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
I don't know what to say.
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,  this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
Well, try not to get burned. You have a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone tempt you away from it.
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Ah!
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
Likewise.
Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that.
Are you in the service?
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
What's your name?
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
Carlson? Is he new here?
Jacob, what can I do?
No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
Go to sleep.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
I don't want to know.
It's not healthy with it closed.
I'm not cold.
What was that?
I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
Who did?
Your back? Did you fall?
If you're lucky.
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
Hot. Where do I sign?
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
I know. That's why I'm asking.
How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
I no from around here.
Push 'em back.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
He'll never make it.
Total delirium.
He's burning up.
Dream on!
Clear the area. This is an order!
We're not going to hurt you.
Please come quietly.
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
Push 'em back.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Total delirium.
He's burning up.
Of course it is. What else could it be?
I'm sorry.
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
Lennox Hospital.
Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?
We're doing everything we can.
I'll page him.
Do you want me to get someone?
No one knows. They say it blew up.
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
A car accident.
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
Can I help you?
Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy.
On top of him?
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
Is he all right?
I have some ice from the machine.
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
I don't have all day, kid.
Alright, asshole.
Okay, enough of this shit.
Oh, come on!
Yes it does.
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
He's not part of the program.
Pause play.
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
Speaking of which, duck!
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
You got lucky.
That's nine to four, geek-boy.
Punk?
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Delongpre! Out of time!
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Done?
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done.
We made it?
Minimal.
I don't know. Nothing.
What?
His mother?
If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
Can we blow it with just two?
We don't have a choice!
We can't lead him into the other hull!
What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
What's that?
No.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
What are you doing?!!
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
It's locked!
Could you show a little compassion?!
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
Goodbye old friend.
We don't have time to argue!
We're not leaving Crutch!
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
What do you mean, not enough time?
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
Duck fuckers?
Sergeant!
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Rizzo did.
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Sergeant? We thought you were...
He came for me, I had to run!
Where the hell were you?!!
He....He...
Where have you been?!!
Thorgan, pull us in.
Okay that hurt.
Kkinsa! Open the doors!
What?!
Uh-oh.
This is gonna work. If he sticks to the program. Will he? Stick to the program?
Thorgan, suit up.
Goodbye, my love.
Let's move out!
Done!
Two more charges to go.
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
What are you doing back?!!
Kay-Em!
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
Hey! I'm not ready.
They're back here.
I'll need system four converters.
What are you gonna do, tell me?
We're not supposed to do that.
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
The hull's imploding!
Shit!
I think I broke my arm.
Everyone okay?
Where'd you get the gun?
Better let me.
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
You see that?
And you said high school was boring.
Nice touch.
Cool.
Creepy.
Hey, easy now.
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
Boeman, the ships not here.
Suit up.
Earth II.
And now we're all out of it.
It bought us some time.
Faster! Don't we have another gun?
Hurry!
I don't know!
Then what do we do?!
Then stop talking and work faster!
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
Where is...?
Thorgan? You coming?!
I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
How many?
We could convert fission transistors.
We'd need charges.
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
Sergeant!
But I didn't see...
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
Yeah yeah. Got it.
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
Wait a minute...I need...
Fine, just stay out of my way.  Hit it.
What the hell are you doing?
That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
I am an expert!
Get them in the lab!
Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?!
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Where is he?
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Negative.
Fuckin A...
Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Pull me in!
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
I get it.
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
Old woman?
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
You okay?!
I'm stuck!
Rizzo, pull away!
I know you.
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
I think so, why?
Did you like it?
I think I had some when I was eight.
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
Rizzo, you okay?
You'll be fine.
Okay, good tip.
You wanna release your air tanks?
Eat me.
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
Oh sure, all the time.
Got it.  You ever space walked?
Wait around on your asses all day.  I'll need a distraction.
You?
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
Not so bad.
See? We're not so bad.
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
I couldn't save them.
And what happend to ...?
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
Were you close to your father?
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh? You must have been a very lonely girl.
I thought you meant...
My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
That's why I'm here.
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
What's this?
Hey!!
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
Hey.
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
Rizzo?!
What if we don't?
What if you miss?
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
We're screwed!
I guessed.
Med-kit?
Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
No you don't!
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
Guys!!! The shuttle?
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
Rizzo, he's out there.
Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
Outta here?
I hope so.
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
We have to get off this ship.
Where are you going?
They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the  shuttle.
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
No shit. I got no problem with that.
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
Oh I like her a lot.
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
That's really funny.
More time...shit, she's had 400 years...
She needs a little time.
Well?
She broke my fucking nose!
Spunky . . .
I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
It's time.
We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
Now what?
Shut up, Thorgan!
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
Well, do something!
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
I'll help you in.
Just come on, I've got an idea.
Okay?!!
Again?! Jesus!
Kaboom.
I'm on my way.
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
He's right behind us!
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
We're screwed.
Yuck.
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
NO!
Close the fucking door!
They'll make it.
They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
He was chasing me!
You lost the charge?
I...I don't know what I did...
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
Push off toward us.
I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.
Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
GO, GO, GO!
And what's with the headgear?
Thank you.
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
Just get us to the ship!
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
I'm missing two!
You're leaving me here alone?
You're so bossy.
Would you?
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
So what else is new?
Hurry! She's lost it!
Let's just get out of here.
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
That ought'a help the situation.
I'm gonna spew.
Small brains make your balls itch?
This is what it means right here.
Crutch?
What do we do?!!
Jesus! Can't you knock?  Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
What are you doing?
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
Oh my God! Adrienne?
Jesus!
You prefer an apple?
Later.
You're quicker than usual.
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
I don't know...sorry?
Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?
I'm just saying.
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
No.
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
Maybe she tripped.
I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
You killed him?
Are there any other shuttles?
I'm surrounded by idiots.
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
Barbie from hell...
Robot huh?
I missed you too.
Kay-em you okay?
Kay-Em we made it!
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
Kay-Em, you okay?
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
Good point.
Sorry, sorry.
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Almost done.
Come here, might as well fix that arm.
Am I in there?
Oh shit! There he is!
The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
No! He's coming with us!
Leave him behind!
Defense droids. I'm on it.
Kicker!
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out.
We're missing two of the kids!
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
But?!!
I gotta go back.
What?!!
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
Thirty seconds.
Then open the doors!
The power's back up!
Keep trying!
Something's wrong.
I just know.
How do you know?
Ssh.
What?
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
I don't understand...what does he want?
See you then . . . doctor.
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
I'm sending you the files.
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
Three...two...one...
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
You're crazy!
How do you open the damn door?
4You're not going anywhere.
Guys, please come with me!
That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
More soldiers?
They can deal with this sort of thing.
What good will that do?
Are we locked down?
You wanna die?
You're not going anywhere.
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
Get him out of there!
Azrael can you repeat that?
I didn't say he was alive.
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
Are you finished?
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
Jason? He's on this ship?!
That's right, now if you could...
But...I...400 years?
We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
30? How long was I out?
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
Nanotechnology.
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Obviously so.
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
It's okay.
Guys, he's right behind us!
Sure but what good will that do?
Can we get through these?
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
Yes!
Exactly.
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
What have I done?! Idiots.
What have you done?
Old Earth?
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
Hockey player? He's not a ...
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
My cars. And a comic book.
Sure, Dad.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
My boat's neat, dad!
Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
Some friends and me took a house.
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
I didn't know her.
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.
...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
What's the matter with my printing?
Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there.
We never had any. What's the problem?
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
We're not even sure what it was.
Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!
Do I set the goddam hook?
Look at him take it!
I can't believe that people pay money to go fishing. This is really dumb. This isn't even relaxing... it's just boring.
Twenty years.
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
Set?
One more after this, then I'm going home.
We're blowin' half the bounty on bait --
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
Leg of lamb this time?
Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind three nibbles back.
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
You wanna call it a night after here?
Well... is everything all right?
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
I've got all these signs here...
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
I just hope you don't consider her a close friend.
You know how I feel about her.
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
But it's breakfast for supper. Your favorite, Paulie. I made French toast and sausage. Patties, not linkies, just like you like it.
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
Me neither. But I'm going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count. See you.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
What a trip, man.
Did you hear it's yours?
Just like our moms and teachers!
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Hey man.
What are you talking about?
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
Excuse me?
No... I guess not.
I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?
Good, I'll be sure to do that, Amanda. I'll make a note of it.
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
What? My eyes are not lying!
Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
I heard that was you.
No thanks. I'm off pills.
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
Your name, please?
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
Well, it's not. You're not a lion in a pride!  These kids, acting like lions with their unplanned pregnancies and their Sunny Delights.
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
No sir.
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
Turkey mostly.
Vernon, Florida.
Not so good. You sure you have to?
Walter Livesy.
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed to leave?
Nervous?
Any word from that gallery?
...Janitor's job.
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
...That'd be my guess.
...Diebold?
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
What about the owner of the house...  ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
Without his car?
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
Where would we find him?
Could be.
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
His Parole Officer.
Who are you?
What happened?
Now you gotta be careful.
You're clean.
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
Were they wearing condoms?
With how many people?
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
How many times have you gone unprotected?
Yes. Altogether.
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
How old you?
Yeah. Do it again.
Yeah me too.
Man we fucked him up.
Yo, we might have killed him. You think?
You sure?
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
I had a female vagina last night.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
You goin'?
Where you goin' tonight?
Where you at?
Casper! Was up kid?
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
What the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat down?
What?
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
Here. Swallow.
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
Bang up stuff.
I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex.
Oh man. You gotta see this. It's a spectacle. A real spectacle.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
Do you care about me?
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
I wouldn't believe it?
Why is that?
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
Because, you know why. You know.
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
Yeah.
I guess so.
Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance.
Come dance.
Dance!
I'm sorry.
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Were you protected?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
How old are you?
Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
Hello.
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
Yeah?
Whah you say? Dissdee?
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
Whah is dissdee?
Whah?
Have you ever swallowed it before?
And you don't get shit out of it.
Because he can like climax you up to that...
Yep.
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
You know. Because sometimes the foreplay is just so good. And then when it actually comes time for sex. It's like the worst letdown.
Yep.
You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.
Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I start thinking about what I'm gonna eat afterwards.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Oh shit.
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Yeah.
Sweet.
Yep.
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
What?!
Holy shit. That's all true?
Oh god. That's horrible.
No.
Yeah?
I hate 'em.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
Four-thirty in the morning?
When are you gonna be back?
Shh.
That's right.
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
Hi Telly. Where you been?
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
I don't know, eight or nine.
You want a wip-it?
What are you guys doing?
Hello?
Hello?
Yeah.
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half.
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Slow.
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
I can't man.
What man? What is it?
What's the first street?
What are you talking about?
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
You want me to what?
How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
Very good.  How did you know?
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
The game's over.  You lost.
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
No you haven't.  And even if you had it doesn't matter.  Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call.
By that time the game will be over.
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
Hello, Peter.
--you're hopeless!  You can't even read a sentence!  Didn't they teach you punctuation in school?  The game ends tonight!
Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought of that.  If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.
The police haven't told you?
I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
Very good.
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
Very nice speech, Peter.  Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu?  There's an old wooden bench in the garden.  Next to it is a rock.  You'll find a message for you under it.  Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are.
The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
What makes you think I was there?
What?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
Have you any idea what the message is?
So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
Pain?  Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
Just for that no hint today.
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
Because she's the type.
Not really.
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town.  Upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown.  Crawling through the window.  At the end of Miss Emma's street.  Her God has gone and left his home.  So her and I can meet."
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
You'll find her.
I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
No, only the path she chose to travel.
To get your attention.
Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
Hello, Peter.
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
Hello, Peter.
Don't you see?  I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat with them all.  I held their hands.  I stroked their hair.  I was with them to the end.  I took away the blood.  I washed them.  Their crossing was peaceful.
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
You don't understand.
The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
1985.  Hans Korshaud.
There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
Now what?
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
Nope.  Nothing.
No problem.  We're in.
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
Okay.  Nice meeting you.
No... but I can tell.  A woman knows these things.
I know he really likes you.
Do you like my dad?
Boys.
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
Uh huh.
Who's Kathy?
But you promised.
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
You ready?
Thanks, David.
What is it, dad?
No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.
Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
Okay.
That has nothing to do with it.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
Congratulations, dad.
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
Yeah.
Wait, I've saved the best for last. Andy, hit the lights, will you?
This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
Not a drop.  Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross.
He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
No Frank.  No prints.
No prints.
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
Bingo.
Not that I can see.  We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
Six, eight hours tops.
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
Through a rental agency.
Ten days ago.
You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.
Feel like practicing?
She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?
Exactly... and you did this.
What do you see here?
Whatever's on your mind.
Just thought you might want to talk.
You're always in the middle of a match.
Peter...
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
He knows you're aware of that.
"Carefully".  "Carefully". "Carefully".
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
Bainbridge Books.
We'll call you back.
I can check and call you back.
Bainbridge Books.
Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
I'm not nervous.
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command!  You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
You will go alone.
You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
Of course it was.
You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
Each to his fate.
Yes. It is today.
I road them often in my youth.
They can be saddled.
Do not let the waters touch you.
We must enter the swamp.
I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
You will not, then?
One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me.  Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
Let me comfort you.
You too are lonely.
Even by you?
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
Am I not worth returning to?
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
What else is left for a man without friends.
Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
No more, my lord - my friend. With Ergo the Magnificent by your side, your enemies are dead men.
My <u>friend</u>.
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
Once is enough, thank you.
Staying alive.
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
For that rudeness, peasant lout, I am going to leave you hanging by your heels when I depart. Which is right now.
Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
And mine goes with you.
My heart stays here.
I cannot go with you, my friend.
Quell?
And what do you think a small person lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination.
A small house.
A venison pie as big as a house.
No.
Can't I come, too?
We'll meet you at the inn.
Where are you going?
I'm glad.  I'm very glad.
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
What is that awful looking place?
I am Quell.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
You!
A <u>boar</u>? Those incompetent louts couldn't catch a piglet, much less a boar.
Would you settle for a boar?
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
No, no. I'm with you, boy.
Would you desert your friends?
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
We meant only to please you.
It's right behind you.
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
I don't think it's working.
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
I only want one.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
I'd wish for a puppy.
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
I'm hungry.
I ...  ... am Titch.
I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
You can have half.
You do?
I have a cinnamon bar.
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
No.
Sugarballs?
No.
Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little.  Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin.  Let me climb to the top and sing to it.
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
Hush!
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
Oh, my poor stew!
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
Food for crows.
And do you think I live on air?
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel with thieves and robbers.
Put me down, you lout!
Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
They'll trample him to death!
Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me.
<u>Me</u>? Travel with <u>you</u>? I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision. And I do not travel with peasants and beggars. Goodbye!
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
He will not come. You will be my queen.
Then he will die!
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
Then look!
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
A fine match.
A match for your son, I think.
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
That I am, my lady.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
I knew.
I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
Yes.
It is important to assure the succession.
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
Freylag's stronghold?
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
What news from our friends?
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
Modred! Impossible!
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
How many did you lose?
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
Yes. We lost five.
You were attacked in the forest?
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
Can you see?
I will seek the Fortress for you.
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
With an old voice?
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
Yeah... How do you know it?
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in.  But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself.
Why do you want to know?
...Good...  But what's special in him?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?
Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
Take them, you never know... If you want to have some fun. Take, it's a gift.
Take...
I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  That's why you can't have a bank account!
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Do you need money?
That's what I later told myself!  No, Tony, forget Leon! It can't be him, he likes too much his job to make such a slaughter!
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
...You moved too, didn't you?
Don't fear.
...One second.
...Yes?
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
Yes?
Huh?
Huh, that's good!
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
Huh? That's smart!
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
How are you, Miss?
Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.
...OK... Good.
Ten dollars... A month.
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
You can't sit here like that.
Salute.
Salute.
...Yeah.
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
It's a specialty down there.  It's a fishing boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. Then, near the cabin, a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout.
No...
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
Yes... Twice.
Have you ever been in Messina, son?
No... Dino's.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
Is he still alive?
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
...Who sent you?
I know... But I'm a little pressed.
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
But... He works for your same employer?
Emilio? Due grappe!  ...Why the hell did you come here?
Messina.
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
These guys have no place.  They change virtually everyday. And his name...  It's a surname.
May we have this wolf's name and address?
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
...Even his mother wouldn't.
Do you recognize him?
Then...
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.
Here comes the resume.
This smells good.
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
For a walk.  I don't know.
He probably just went somewhere.
Don't wait by the phone.  If he's really been walking this whole time, he's out of our jurisdiction...
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
How long does this... Mania last?
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
What would you like us to do?
Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
You need a ride, Preacher?
Are you a preacher?
Mine.
It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
It can, but it'll have to wait in line.
The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, "Claudication,"  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
I've seen it before.
I know what you're getting at.
Yes -- you are.
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
So what's the deal Maurice?
You don't have to prove anything to her.
Doubts?  About what?
That's a reasonable assumption.
Most certainly.
Why?
I see.
From where?
To where?
I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
Out of the car.  He jumped out of the god damn car!
Jumped where?
Shit!  He jumped!
That's all right isn't it?
I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
P-A-R-K-E-R.  Right.  Get on the horn with Philly.  Call me here.
Hansen's whipped.  Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home.  Why?
A marriage certificate?  Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
If he is, half the town has seen us take him out for dinner like a couple of jack-asses.
This guy's not a murderer.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
Not our problem.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
Not our problem.
Red flags man.
If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
Red flag, man.
His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
What's his story?
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
Nine.
That's me.
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
You tell stories?
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
Yeah!
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
This is the route approved by triple A.  Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you'd still be looking at roughly the same distance...
What was that?
Damn baby, relax.  I'm getting to it.  From Philadelphia following the route highlighted to Pacifica California -- you're traveling an estimated three thousand two hundred miles...
Each inch represents 150 miles...
Maybe.
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
Umm, Coalville Utah.
Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.
God damn, you're right... You don't say much Michelle, but what you say is golden.
Umm, no.  It's just that --
What are you saying?  This story is too big for this paper?
The Gazette's small huh?
Mammoth.
This story is big huh?
She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
Don't do this.
I do.
I can't do it.  I want you to finish, but I want you to live more.
Come on Mr. Parker.
Saluting.
I was thinking you could open another store with investors.  I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
You were right.  From the heart is always better.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
You're amazing.
Tom Joad?
What Mr. Parker?
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
Why know?
I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
She knew you loved her.
Oh, a coastal city.  That's good.
You're walking to California?
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
Phileas Fogg?
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
Walking where?
When are you leaving?
Where?
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
Are you firing me?
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them.
What happened?
Pulitzer, here I come.
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
You're amazing.
Someone should be with you.
... My father.
Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give you your fish sticks.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
You're in pain.
Steph.
In a hospital.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
Yes.
He's getting my sweater from the car.  I said there was a breeze.  I told him not to go.
Forty-seven years.
You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
Is it a boy or a girl?
Good morning.
What's your shoe size?
I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
How are you feeling?
Hello, Mr. Parker.
This is my only chance to get a watch like that.  It would mean a lot to me and my family.  Please take it.  It really isn't that much.
I really want that watch.
No.  I won't take it unless I pay for it... Let's see, that's a pretty nice watch -- I can see that.
I've always wanted a watch like that.
We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times.
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
Water?
Sparkling apple cider?
Coffee?
Orange soda?
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
What do you want?
There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
How much, do you think?
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
Right here at the hotel. Why?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
Do I look that obvious? My name's Paul.
About ready for another drink?
Sera... please go.
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
Have you told anyone that I'm here?
Yes? What?
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
A full night on the street and this is all?
Where have you been?
All of it. I need to buy many things... all of it!
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
With an old friend.
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
You have been lonely?
I will keep you safe. We are both older.
You have been lonely?
I want this, Sera. I need this!
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
But it's a top three school --
Harvard Law School?
Who?
You're fired. I have new representation.
What?
Get up.
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
I believe we are.
Are we done for today?
I'll take that as a no.
Go to hell.
Were you with another man?
I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
I loved him!
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
Why would I kill my husband?
Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
I can't tell you.
What alibi?
To me it is. He doesn't trust me. Why should I trust him?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
Is he always such an ass?
He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house once --
What's going on?
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
I'm a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I'd lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
It's so shameful...
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
Huh?
Come again?
Who's askin'?
I do. I'm not allowing it.
You're not going up there.
I'm a man who knows what I want.
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
About the alibi --
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
Sit down.
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
What are you talking about?
Why the hell not?
Did you get it?
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
Just the love in my heart.
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
No, she was crying her eyes out.
Was she carrying a weapon?
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
What did you see when you entered the house?
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
Uh -- both?
I'm sorry?
-- uh --
What?
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
Well, I recommend knowing before speaking. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt.
I don't know.
-- his life?
How about --
I think so...
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
Yes?
Aristotle.
Yes?
Name?
Relation?
Licensed attorney or family member?
Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
I'm a bitch.
Maybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case.
You almost had me fooled.
He's already got his coffee -- maybe he needs a donut.
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
The idiot speaks.
Our group is full.
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
Where's Warner?
We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.
I got bangs!
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
Absolutely!
What, like on va-kay?
Are you sure?
How could this happen?
Oh, he is so over on this campus.
What happened?
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
Helloo... he just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got "The Rock".
You don't really believe she's innocent?
That's the story she'll be telling the jury. We just have to prove it.
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
Well, in all likelihood, she's completely guilty as well. She was seen standing over her husband's dead body.
Amazing how?
Maiden name -- Daniels.  You know her?
It's pink.
You should. Do you have a resume?
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
Yes? Ms. Woods?
Why not?
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
Your what?
Uh, no. Maybe you should try the Lido deck.
Class schedule, map, book list.
Chuck.
Three months.
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
Yes.
I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.
Haven't you seen the cabana boy?
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
I never met the woman, but from what my daughter tells me, she's quite the cun --
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.
There he is!
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
Wait -- Cecil has a condo in Tahoe. Let's go there!
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
Is it a Kappa?
Where's the Rock?
Fire moat... why do that?
We come watch... we come watch...
You go?  Not watch fun?
Then we smash 'em?
Fool's magic.
Why so few?
You go to lady now?
More fun win battle?
We watch... good fun...
Birdies... pretty...
We go out, smash 'em now?
Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.
What?
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
You come stealee tleasoo?
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
Flozen foleva not good.
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
You come stealee tleasoo?
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
There's a coil of golden thread fine as spider web yet naught can break it... and a silver key no lock can resist.
Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
Who might these friends be?
Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
Sorry.
How're these?
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
Aye... my Lord...
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
Sweet slippers of Oisin!
Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
Three cheers for our champion.
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
You see!  You see!
No, no, no... this is different!
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
Nay.  Jack's the dragon-slayer, ain't you, Jack.
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work.
Step lively now!
Thought the weather terrible of late.
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
Sorry, Jack.
Hello, Jack.
Or a kite...!  We could make a kite... Let the wind do the work --
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
What care the bones when the soul is free?
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
Up ahead!
Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
Small miracles better than no miracles...
Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
What's she doing?
What do we do now?
The fastest in the world.
May God protect you.
You're well equipped, I'd say. Legendary arms...
Uhm... fine work.
Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
How came you by this blade?
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
In a dream.
Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
Nay.  Castle Couer de Noir is Devil's work... built with sorrow and grief...
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
You follow.
That very nice.
To Castle Couer de Noir?
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
Jimmy Squarefoot no lost.
Lost?
The Black Baron, you say?
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
With Dale.  Oh, and I got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through!
We did a lot of the wiring too.
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
He was there and then he wasn't!
Dad's disappeared!
I'm not cheating!  I'm not looking!
What are you doing?
Marco!
When does George get to come see his house?
I checked everywhere.  He's not there.
He's not there.
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?
And video games after!
Did you know him before you knew Dad?
Sam!
We can work.
I wanna be with you today.
Are you going to see Sam again?
I love red!  That's my favorite color!
What color?
Who are you?
I don't think Dad wants you home.
I would have anyway.
Mom said I should.
Atonement.
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
Has he eaten anything at all?
Why?  What do you mean?
I couldn't sleep last night.
Oh God, we don't want the police!
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
I couldn't get it to go down.
I put him to work.
Here, honey!
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
We've known each other since grade school.
You've been good this week.
And of course the Beck's, with the...
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
Months.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
Well, if it is, we have a problem.
Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
I hate to ask about a window.
Allowed outside the enclosed area.
An exhaust system or a window is code.
Oh, yes.
Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
Mr. Stevens?
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
You're here early today.
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
I want you both to stay.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
I didn't recognize you!
Sam?
She didn't really say.
She's out with a friend.
Where are you?  You're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  I want you in me now!
And you thought they might be under her dress?
I did warn you.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
George, this is the third time.
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
This has got to stop!
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
Hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer.
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.
No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
Good for you.
Can you build a house in four months?
No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
What kind of house?
What would you do?
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
God, you look like crap, George.
It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
I know there's an explanation.
At least your father tried, George.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
Left you this place.
We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
I don't even care if he ever comes back.
Because Dad left?
It's okay.
I just wanted to know where Mom was?
How many bedrooms will your house have?
I could use the money.
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing.  She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
Don't even...I'm there.
You got the money?
Nothing.
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
Been thinking?
Then you tell me, what just happened?
What the fuck?
What are you talking about?
He said he heard hammering.
I guess I could teach you some things.
Do you know anything about building a house?
Why?
It's not ours.  It's George's.
Hey.
Dad's home, already?
Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!
Yes, it is.
Someone stop her!
Can we really help build a house?
All day again?
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
Dad said it first.
Queer.
Why?
Better make it a week.
A night in the hole?
That's my girl.
Nigger.
No, nigger.
Nagger?
They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger?
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
He's a big one.
And the baby?
She's doing just fine.
Is Mae Rose okay?
She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
Not for me, it ain't.
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
Hell with him. It ain't that.
Cost you a pair of nylons.
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
At least the kid's getting out. Isn't this what you wanted?
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
Sharp.
Yeah...
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
No, but...
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
Want me to come back some other time?
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
She always said that if you were on the outside...
Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
She got married last month.
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?
He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
Goodnight, Claude.
I'll be right back.
You know I trust you, Claude.
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
You know, I'm fixing on retiring at the end of the summer, gonna try to enjoy what few years I have left. What do you think of this place? It's one of those new retirement communities down on the Gulf.
Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.
We'll see what those slippers feel like after, say, 24 hours. And if you step down off them bottles -- if one toe so much as touches the dirt -- one of these boys is gonna shoot you dead. Let's see. We need a special man for this job.
Comfortable?
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
I don't need the Baptists on my back, but I suppose I could issue a temporary marriage license for a nominal fee.
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
Sure, Claude, whatever you say.
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
But I'm having a good time...
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
He looks like he can take care of himself.
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
Can't you remember your own name?
I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
I've never seen you in here before.
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
You ever done time before?
How you doin'?
How about some steak sauce?
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
You got your own nightclub?
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
You heard what the man said! Move it!
Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!
That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
Movin' it out, boss.
Move it out.
All in, boss!
You heard the boss! Let's move!
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
Life, huh? They step outta line again, we'll shorten up that sentence real fast.
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
He's from New York City. That one, too.
State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.
Why ain't that pick swinging?
Why ain't his pick swinging?
Where am I at, man?
Hey, Ray...
You mean Louis Armstrong?
So it don't exist.
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
What do you think about that?
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story.  Nigger, you crying?
What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
Oh, right. Well, why didn't they get those pardons?
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
Hey, the dude's holdin'.
Nothing to it, really. Claude figured they could steal a couple of bodies from the morgue. They got a couple of crackers working there don't know their asses from their elbows. Then they was gonna set fire to the infirmary and make it look like those bodies was them that got stuck inside. Claude figured during the commotion, it wouldn't be too hard to slip onto one of the fire trucks and hang tight until it rolled right on out of here in the morning.
Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
It's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. Just don't make a habit of it.
Of course nobody believed Ray and Claude.
Just like Elvis.
Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.
What were they, bootleggers?
Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
1932? That's like, that's like...
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
Don't you lie to me, Rayford.  You still have your daddy's watch?  Well, this is all I can give you. I wish it was more.
Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
Rayford!
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
Wait for the firemen!
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
Is everyone here?
What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
What's going on here?
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
Thank you, Claude. That'll be all for tonight.
You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.
Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
I prefer bourbon.
Lemonade?
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
Shoot him, Wilkins!
I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.
Something like that, yes.
Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
Are you offering me a bribe?
Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
Who?
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
Appreciate it.
Jenny?
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
What's the Boom Boom Room?
They run but they never get too far.
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
That's a long story...
Me? Willie Long.
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
You found him.
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going.
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
I'm interested. Keep talking.
Where'd you get this?
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
Absolutely not.
Is this a joke?
Little Nicky.
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
I hear a train coming. Drink.
Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
He's sick?
You shouldn't have come here.
Don't do it!
No!
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
You mother...
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
All right. Let me out.
Hello, Cassius.
Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
"Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.
It's our time, brother.
...their damned souls will be ours.
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
We could create our own hell there.
What do you think about... Earth?
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
That's what I thought!
Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
It's just such a slap in the face.
And he's dead serious.
You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
You want a queen? Got one right here.
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
I'm calling you out, brother...
Urr... uggg... errr...
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
Uh. No it won't?
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
And give you a good buzz.
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
Sure, why not?
But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
Noon...
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
She goes to Parson's, right?
Show him Central Park.
You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
So excited.
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
Where is he? He's late.
Did you just talk?
What's Nicky doing down there?
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
You did it for Namath.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky.  You get your ass back up there. You save your father!
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
Knock, knock.
Bus?
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Thanks.
Hey.
That's what I'm thinkin'...
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
Boogerland!
What was it called, sir.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
It's Stanley, sir.
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
I started slow, though. For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I'll take the soup.
I know, your wickedness.
You know, I was the one who created Hell.
You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
Oh, would you grow up.
Easy, Liberace.
No.
By she, do you mean he?
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
This don't look good.
Peppermint... alright.
Schnapps...
We know where to find Nicky.
Looking for the chief.
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
You sure you're down with this?
We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
That's a big pass, Elton John.
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
Look who's back from the dead.
The Dark Prince is here.
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
Yeah. You do it.
Should we wake him up?
Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
What's with that guy?
Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
There's our man.
'Bout time...
Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
Come on. One more time.
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
That way.
I was DeNiro!
Yes, great movie...
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
You keep a bat under your seat?
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
You followed him?
So I followed him...
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
You gotta kill yourself.
Dude. Seriously?
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
Please. You got to.
You got the wrong window again, man.
Andrew.
I don't need luck. I'm good.
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
Hello.
I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
A black guy?
And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
Why is that funny?
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
You callin' me a thief, my man?
See something you like, my man?
Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
Hurry... hurry... hurry.
Do you have anything special in mind?
Fine... Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.
I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
And I did it myself right on there.
I am.
It's a real privilege, Sandman.
Yes. Oh yes.  He was after you. I remember. You're running!
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
I'm very smart.
Here.
I'm Mary 2.
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
Do you want to see Doc?
Hello, Sandman.
Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
Too little?  Too little. Okay, wait for me.
Too little.
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Well? How do you like it?
Sure, I'm okay.
Pete... You okay?
You okay?... What's wrong?
You okay, man?
Pile in.
What's happenin'?
You want somethin'?
You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten Pin".
Good... You up for a drive?
You're not contagious are you?
Why not?
Why not?
What do you mean by that?
You're a musician?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
Maid? Relative?
Do you own a video camera?
The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.
Very strange.
There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
What's that, Ed?
You know what I think?
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
Ours, Ed.
His or ours?
What a fuckin' job.
Yeah... Laurent.
You recognize that guy?
Yeah.
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
Or not so recently?
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
Or something.
You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.
If anything else happens, you'll call us.
As best we can.
We'll keep a watch on the house.
Anybody else have a key to the house.
Might be a good time to try using it again.
Right... This just glided along.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
How'd the camera get so high like that?
Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
Yes, I believe so.
I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
Wonderful, Pete. Really wonderful. Alotta people Pete... alotta people are gonna be very happy.
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
No.
We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
Never saw him before in my life.
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
The police called us.
You don't look so good.
Sit down.
Sit down a minute.
Do ya good.
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
No.
Have you made any charges against him?
Same as always. Pete takes care of himself.
His physical condition.
His condition? What do you mean?
Yes.
The wife killer?
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
We saw you that night, Pete.
No... Here he comes.
You talk to him?
Out in back.
Where's Pete?
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
We'll get a tail put on him.
You just gonna let him go?
What's the word on the street?
One of the guards must have leaked it.
Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
Did you ask him who he is?
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
Where is he now?
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
Repeat that, Bill.
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
Yeah, Mack?
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
Who is it?
No, sir, it's not.
That's not Fred Madison?
I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
Pete, what happened to you?
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
I want to see him.
He didn't come home.
What about yesterday?
When he went to work, right.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
I wouldn't know how.
He won't give his name.
We know that.
What's the matter?
Do you remember?
Coming up.
I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. I've never seen this man before. Neither have the guards. I don't think he's in the system.
A headache?
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
Not even close.
He's not Madison?
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
Who is this man?
I don't know yet.
What is this, Rogoff?
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
No.
I won't ever tailgate.
I... I didn't say anything...
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
Tone deaf.
What's your axe?
There's no other bedroom?
Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
What is it?
I can't give you anymore. I'll talk to the doctor.
What's bothering you, Madison?
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
Something wrong?
Alice who?
At your house.
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
At your house. Don't you remember?
We've met before, haven't we?
I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
The heart, I guess.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
Which would you choose?
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
They're gonna cook him.
How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.
We just killed a couple of people...
At your house. Don't you remember?
Let me have it.  "Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."
Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.
I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
Yes, sir.
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
All of it?
"Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria. Conway can tell nothing of his experiences. Is suffering from complete loss of memory. Signed, Gainsford."
Oh, read it!
Cable from Gainsford.
If you want me to!
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Nothing. Why?
Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
No.
Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
You get out of here! If any of you men think you can come busting in here-
What do you want?
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
Are you taking me?
No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
I thought so!  He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy.  Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
We have reason. It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw all the nations strengthening, not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy. I saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army. I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder, would rage so hotly over the world that every book, every treasure, would be doomed to destruction. This vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to gather together all the things of beauty and culture that I could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing.  Look at the world today! Is there anything more pitiful?  What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other, propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. The time must come, my friend, when this orgy will spend itself, when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword. Against that time is why I avoided death and am here, and why you were brought here. For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life. And it is our hope that they may find it here. For here we shall be with their books and their music and a way of life based on one simple rule: Be Kind.  When that day comes, it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world.  Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured each other, the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall inherit the earth.
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
Sondra Bizet.
That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
What is it, my son?
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
Yes.
Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.  For I am going to die.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
Thank you.
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
Please don't go.
And if I say yes?
Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.
I gotta be honest about something.
And Goodwill Toward Man?
I guess I lost:
What the hell...
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
Hesitated, sir.
It'll make sense later?
So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.
Yes, sir.
What happens if I say no?
No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir.
They don't?
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
You do?
All the time, sir.
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
Actually, sir--
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Then where did it-- ? Sir.  Forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--
Well this didn't.
Bull... loney- Sir.  I'm sorry.  Sir, I'm sorry. Sir.  I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  I mean, everything here comes from you.
Actually, it didn't come from me.
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
Kay...
Home?  You gotta be kidding me.    Black?
'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
Helluva night, isn't it?
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
Kay, listen, I dunno what got into--
Kay, I'm sorry...
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
I'd go with number three.
What?
Why?  What are you gonna do?
Sir, you can't just--
Sir--
What?  Who the hell are you?
You're not taking me in!
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
I understand.  I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
I figured it didn't matter.  It's my last day of business.   I was wrong.  I'm sorry.  Hey, look what I got for you-- a free-floating plasma pad? --One of the good ones, too, with zoids.
The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
No.
Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
Come on now.  People are smart.
How could it not?
It's... coming.
I dunno. One?
Yeah, wall, you know, I was just going there... to pick then up.
Er. well, nowhere special.
Nowhere.
How'd you know that?  Kay?
Actually, yeah--
Noon exactly.
Yeah, Kay?
Nope.  Nothing at all.
Nothing.
We've got about eight or nine prospects	I want you look--
I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
I promised I wouldn't tell.
Found it.
I wanna make a deal.
Will it lower the curve?
What if I don't?
They're not my pals--
That and, well... I want my friends to see me on CNN.    Okay, I will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup.  We'll gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it.
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
That's why you have doors, Mr. President.  Keys, however, are to lock the doors.  And locks, as you know, are to keep people out.  Why? Fear.  You humans are afraid.  So you set up boundaries.  Borders. Your car.  Your home.  Your country.  All the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you.  Well I am here to let that enemy go.  Because there's a border you didn't even know existed.  It's the border to the Universe.  And unlike your other borders, you humans didn't set this border up to keep other planets from you.  It was set up by others, to keep you away from them.  Until now.  Because I have been sent here to open the door.  To present you, so to speak, with the key to the universe.
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs.  But whatever you do, don't scratch.
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
Here --
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
They were performance pieces.
Yes, you did.
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
Oh, yes.
You don't remember me, do you?
Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
That's not much.
Whatever you say, John.
Why?
And replace them with new ones.
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
It's actually kind of a rush.  They say you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes.  That all your dreams come true.
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
No... we have the two previsions from the twins right here, but...  ... I can't pull up any data from the female.  Probably just a glitch.
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Not to mention, "Saved by the bell".
Hence the expression...
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
For that, we have to go for a ride.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
That's an old one.  One of our first.
This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
Kill type?
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
Yes, sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners.
Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
Oh... Hi, John.
Do I know you?  Who are you?
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
She grabbed you?  Impossible.  The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
They're not in any pain.  We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep, but they can't be kept too awake either.
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
Uh, I'll try...
I guess that's all of it.
Tell me how.
Then take her to Radio Shack.
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
So?
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
Are you reading my mind right now?
She's a precog?
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
Well, hello there, honey-pie.
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
Lara, I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
He's dead, Lara.
You have an emergency call on your private line.
I padded your expense account for the last six months.
Congratulations, sir.
Sir, the press conference is starting.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
The guy from USA Today is here.
Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
No, I wanna kill my boss!
Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
Good.  What I can do is set you up down in the --
Right here.
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
I wanna kill my boss.
Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder...
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
It's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the Chief.  That you think I might, you know, fuck with him, if I had the chance...
That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
I forgot my glasses.
Howard --
Sure.  Raincheck.
Raincheck?
Ah.  That must be why you look so nice.
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
We could have lunch together.
I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
What about your meeting?
How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
Who?
He looks familiar.
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
They've never been separated before.
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
Good luck.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
You sure? I just made it.
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
You're Bobby, right?
We have snifters
When served warm --
Snifter are for warm drinks --
It's on West Broadway.
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
Women?
As far as...?
Thank you, sir.
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
All the suites are about the same.
What, sir?
Thank you very much, sir.
Are you sure?
Not on me, sir.
I can take you down there.
Yes, sir.
Now, Mr. Slade, you're in room 315.
Phone, room service, mini-bar. Any additional expense. If you need anything you can push the button marked 'Concierge', and they'll be able to help you.
...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
Somebody's getting comfortable.
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
We're in Fashion.
No.
Manhattan.
Come on. Let's go.
We used to take baths together.
Oh no. What is it this time.
But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
I know.
He's alright.
He's great, right. Is he great?
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
Should I fuck him?
He's okay.
Is he cute?
I'm having fun, Sean. Can you handle that...? Yeah. He doesn't judge me.
Holy shit.
Will you leave me alone, already...? No, Sean, it's over... I don't care... As a matter of fact, I am... Yeah. In his hotel room...
Bullshit.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
What the fuck was that about?
I love you. Come home.
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
No.
I don't know.
Uncle Bobby?
Hello.
I want spaghettis.
You're not my daddy.
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
He's not doing it.
No.
It's daytime.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
Ricky's not wearing one.
I -- I -- I... Don't...
Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
But what about them?
Whu --
You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
Tom, the Welsh dude --
I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas?
Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
Now that Limey motherfucker's jumpy and wants to change shit around on me. Maxie's gonna shit a Nokia when he hears about... Aw, shit, I better call him before he hears.
'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?.
That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?
Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
Ricky's taken care of.
Understand me?
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?
Depends what night.
Spa?
I can wait around if you want.
Well, this is the corner.
You don't know where you're going?
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Soho.
Traveling light. I like that.
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
I be off in a minute.  Say again...?
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
I'm on the phone.
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
Any time, bro.
Sorry, man, but...
He's not here.
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
Ruiz isn't here.
I want to leave right now.
I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
Yeah. I want it.
Where's the surprise?
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
Kinda. Yeah.
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
He's on the list.
Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
What?
You see a Ricky Slade?
How is it you're good? You on a list?
The line's over there.
Cool.
Cool. See you later.
You look good, man.
A little.
You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
S'up.
What's up, man.
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
Excuse me.
Yes.
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Yes?
You're up front. Everything's free up here.
How much is what?
I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
Yes?
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
You think it's funny, motherfucker?
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.
Different.
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
No. What is it?
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
You'll love it.
You're from LA, right?
The Soho Grand?
Soho Grand, right?
You rode?
Thanks.
Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.
We're square.
Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
Four fernet.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
Sure. You boys want anything?
That's none of your fucking business.
What?
Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
Outfit? What's he talking about?
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
Far as she knows you're John Gotti. Now put the shit down and act like you got some ass.
What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne.
Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
Man live by his rep.
I'll have it tomorrow.
Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.
And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
Next week, Brother Minister.
No, Brother Minister.
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
Down front as always.
Let's cancel.
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
I assumed...
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
Let some of us come down there.
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
Let's get out of this cold.
I'm tired of praying.
Just what are you saying?
Now just a moment, just a moment --
I told you we don't know for certain.
Just what is your question?
That's right.
I don't think we know for certain.
Why don't you just ask your question?
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
Let him finish.
Entirely.
You put it very well.
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
That was a very bad statement. The country loved this man, and you have made it hard in general for Muslims.
Did you see the papers today?
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
If you don't know, man, then I feel sorriest for you.
"His greatest greatness."
Are you Elijah's pimp?
Can I ask you something?
Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
If she got eyes, she do.
'Bout every other night, Red.
You know that gal?
And like a fool I believe it.
I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.
Shorty thought he hit us with 114 years till I explained what concurrently meant. It meant a minimum sentence of 10 years hard labor at the Charlestown State Prison. The date was February 1946. I wasn't quite 21. I had not yet begun to shave.
The sentences to run concurrently.
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew --
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
I do know I love you.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
I know where you're going.
I ain't stupid.
'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
If you don't move out through that door, you're going to be past all regretting.
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
Did you hear me?!
Your control over your children, therefore --
Get out.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
Murder.
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --
You're my father.
Let me die then.
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
Another one?
Please make way, please --
Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.
500.
You had the number.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
Me?
You evil this morning.
You the man.
Sweetie, they're almost ready.
You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.
...That isn't a whore?
Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
I'm the man.
That's right.
Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge?
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
Watch your tongue, boy.
Eddie, let's see that blotter.
Who the hell are they?
You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
Yes sir.
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
I wasn't there. Like I was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse. Like I was invisible.
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
They talked about me like
He's bright.
I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
[Senor?]
[Why?]
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
[Where are you coming from?]
Deal.
I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
Where do I find you?
I have connections.
So what do I get in return?
So where do we begin?
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
A lot of people are looking for you.
[Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.]
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[Daniel.]
[We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.]
[Si.]
[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[No!]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[The what?]
[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
[Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[One-one-three Arco Iris. Third floor.]
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
I don't know, but I know his face.
[The one who transferred Pinta to their car.]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[I don't know, I swear.]
[I don't know. No one knows.]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[I am the President of La Hermanidad.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[Do you know who I am?]
[I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth nothing. She is alive.]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[Her life for your life.]
[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[How much do you want?]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]
[His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
[Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper!]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[Yes. Many times.]
[And I had my men ready.]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
[Please, don't...]
[Correct!]
[Do you know who I am? I am the commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division.]
No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.
And what if amateurs try it?
How does it affect you?
Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
Is it loaded?
Have you used this type before?
What is it?
Show me, please.
Were you provided with a gun?
Camila. Camila Valencias.
What was her name?
Last night. Do you know something?
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
Where are you?
It's Creasy.
Rosanna Guerrero.
She understands men.
For an American she understands this country very well.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.
For a year?
You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
Do you know what she told me last night?
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
[OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will drive around the square two times. Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to I.D. the car.]
[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
[No. Why?]
[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]
[The car will not be powerful and have no trunk.]
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
[Yes.]
[You have the money.]
I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
It will be a hard break.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
That's ridiculous.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
What? Who?
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
Hmm?
I think it's fantastic.
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
Our daughter.
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
[Who's that?]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[And left three more dead men.]
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.]
[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
What?
Hey, Herbie...
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
I told you she wasn't attractive...
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
Marty, your mother wants you onna phone.
No, I'm not kidding.
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
I'll see you.
I'll see you around.
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
Where you going now?
I'm just here with another girl.
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!
Oh, that's a sad story.
That's the one.
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was either...
She was always a bit thin in the hips...
About eight o'clock.
What time is it?
I never thoughta that.
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And he says, "It was easy."
What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
Who buys Italian meat anymore? You think my wife buys Italian meat?  She goes to the A&P, picks up some lamb chops wrapped in cellophane, opens up a canna peas, and that's dinner, boy.
Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? What's he want? Five thousand down? You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice.
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Sure, great if you ain't married.
No, listen, that's my mother, I'm gonna pay for her...
Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
Sure, what?
Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
This is a good deal here, Marty.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
Hey, Marty, come over here a minute.
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses...
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
...and they sit down right next to me...
So these two girls come over to the bar...
You should be ashamed of yourself.
My son Frank, he was married when he was nineteen years old. Watsa matter with you?
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
Well...
I thought he was a big tall fat fellow. Didn't I meet him here one time? Big tall, fat fellow, he tried to sell me life insurance?
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
Ah, my mother, she drives me crazy. I hadda beg her to let me drive her over here. The martyr. She always gotta be the big martyr.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
I just this minute got the baby to sleep.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
Right.
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
Sure.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
On accounta...
I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
So she say, "You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn't throw it anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
Waddaya talking about?!!
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
Wadda you so sore about?
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
Tommy...
Virginia, I don't wanna hear no more about it!
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
I don't wanna talk about it!
Tommy...
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
Don't you think I feel lousy about this too?
I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
Tommy!
Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.
Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in...
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.
Okay.
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
What do you want me to do?
You talked to Walt?
Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski  Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.
There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
Stop him! Stop that man!
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
You boys'll have to go to work early.
Yes, O'Reilly?
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I just got word. We have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.
Good. You've both been working close to the front.
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
You  must  open  me  up  again?
That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?
...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
So long, Ho-Jon.
Wisconsin.
I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
I don't drink intoxicants.
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
We got to stop them right here.
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
I can't... couldn't.
Wait a second...
Don't stop now! Please...
Frank...
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
Godless buffoons, all of them.
Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Ravenous. What about you?
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
We think the same way.
We're a good team.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
I don't mind. If we give them something to talk about.
People will talk.
I have a tent to myself.
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
...And for our Supreme Commander over here and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington.
...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...
...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...
Give us this day our daily...
Is that liquor?
Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
But what about Major Houlihan?
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
A football game?
If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
Right.
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
What?
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
I found a doner.
A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
C-A-M-E-M...?
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
All of them?
Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
It's possible
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
I think we could still have a chance.
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
You think he won't.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
You're asking for somebody else?
Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
You should have been a marriage counselor.  But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
You're on his side all of the sudden?
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
Even if I weren't.
But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye.  You helped me pull together when I needed it.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
Very happily married.
But I'm married.
You're an attractive man.
Our minds?
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
How did you get called that?
Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
Who is knowing? But the drug I have find in his urine is solving all mysteries. By tomorrow will be gone his fast heart and high blood pressure. So I think maybe you will like to tell him goodbye. Okay?
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
You really say the cutest things.
It was really nice of you to take me along.
Second pint.
Thanks.
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
Yes, Reverend?
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
He's coming to.
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
That's about the only thing I don't do  that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer.
I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
Proud to know you, Trapper. Like to shake your hand if you'll hurry up and get that chest closed.  You still working the trains?
The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
I  wouldn't  wish  it  on  a  maneating  shark.
And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
I have not understood what you means.
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington.
I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
That's all the commitment you're offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
Your tent?
You don't aim to cause any trouble  But?
They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
What's wrong with you?
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
Yes, that's what I mean.
What's going on? Who started this?
And another one, but it's from the south.  There.
Damn.
Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
I can try, sir.
Can you make out what they're talking about?
Morning, Captain.
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Good morning, Colonel.
Yes, Colonel.
Oh, get out of here!
Sir?
Stop that, O'Rielly!
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Sir?
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Sir?
Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
Yes, dammit, and...
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
Yes, sir?
O'Reilly!
I out-coached that General Hammond.
What's that, Henry?
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
They can't do that to me!
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
I used to throw the javelin.
Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
In that case, here are ten basic plays. I think that's about all this bunch can handle.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
Good morning.
But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
Nice.
Nice.
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Did you get it, too?
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
Hello?
Devoted entirely to the interests of all the John Does all over the country. Which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. He will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. A man whom he, personally, recommends. A great humanitarian; the best friend the John Does have.
Yes. The John Doe Party.
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
Go ahead, open it, open it.
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
No, no, nothat's your seat.
All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
And, Miss MitchellI think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, er  This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell.
That's only the beginning. You play your cards right and you'll never have to worry about money again. Oh, I knew it.
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
How much money do you get?
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Oh.
That's good.
All set, Ann?
Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
He's watching the other door.
I ain't seen him for a week.
No.
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
That's
Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Bush leagues mostly.[5] Med. shot: To include the rest of them. They have their eyes glued on his face. ANN is very much interested.
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
I used to pitch.
Yeah, a little.
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
I know why you're hangin' aroundyou're stuck on a girlthat's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
All right. You're walking alongnot a nickel in your jeansfree as the windnobody bothers youhundreds of people pass yuh by in every line of businessshoes, hats, automobiles, radio, furniture, everything. They're all nice, lovable people, and they let you alone. Is that right?
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
The heelots!
And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
The heelots!
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy
Naw.
What Bert's trying to say iswellwe need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
You don't have toWhy, we're with you, Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . .
Just like you said on the radio, Mr. Doe.
Yeah. That'sthat's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
Grubbel's here. See?
Oh, yeah. We made Sourpuss chairman and decided to call ourselves The John Doe Club. And, say, incidentally, this is my wife. Come here, honey.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Yeah? Well, you can have it!
It makes no difference, Bertthe ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
A gag. A gag!
A what?
It must be some kind of a gag.
How could he be a fake?
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
No!
Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney
Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance.
And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
Well, anyway, II guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
Ththat's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.
Join the John Doe Club.
Yeh.
Four bits.
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
The elevators are still runnin'.
You bet I will! As fast as I can! Gonna get some canned goodsa fishing rod, and the rest I'm gonna give away.
I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
Aw, Long John . . . I tell youit's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither!
Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
No, sir. That spot under the bridge where we slept last night's good enough for me.
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
I think maybe you'd better. And ConnellI'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
Whyuh
Well?
Huh? Get what?
I want it as soon as possible.
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut andI'll eat him.
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and
Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.
No.
Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
No, I didn't.
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good peoplethey ought to run you out of the countryand I hope they do it!
Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
Did you write itor didn't you?
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
Were you paid for itor weren't you?
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
Is there anything wrong?
Why, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
Uh-huh.
Good night, John.
Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
Did you want to see her about something important?
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
It's good to see you. Sit down.
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
Have you got the speech I gave you?
Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you makeand it's all written out for you.
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
Well, when you get up on the radio, all you have to do is say the whole thing's a frame-up. Make you a hero sure as you're born!
I know one way you can do it.
And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his gloveflopped into a chairand has taken out his ocarina.
Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
Well, you know how they are in baseballif a guy's mixed up in a racket
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
That's too bad.
Nineteen!
I-it's all right, Mrs. Brewster. It was just a sea-gull.  Er. nothing's happened yet! No, I'm watching. Don't worry. Ju-just leave it all to me!
Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it?
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
No, sir.
Is there a crowd in the street?
Well, don't stand there, you idiot. Go and look. Open the window. Oh, why did he have to pick on my building?
I didn't see anything.
Out the window! Something just flew by!
What?
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
Shh!
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
Spencer of the Chronicle .
I'll take half of your action.
What's the line?
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
Apartment 306.
Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.
Where's the stereo?
Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things.
No shit! He's good!
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
Dinner's on you.
Floor seats.
Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
Not that we know of.
I don't know.
No -- you can't do that.
SWAT wants to go in.
Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
Clarence Teal.
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
Of course.
Could I please have a little water?
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
Where did you find an old recording like that?
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
What happened? Is there a problem?
It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.
Who is it?
Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
I won't get away with it.
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
Don't make do it, Mike.
Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!...
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...  They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
You don't want to know.
What happened, Mike.
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement.
So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
I hate fucking Springfield.
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
Tell my dad.
Huh?
It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
They want Walter dead!
Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
You can't help me, man.
Automatic.
What?!
Am I gettin' the car?
Really?
Then where's my FUCKING car!
Where's the car?
Wait a minute, lemme see that.
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
I what?
You signed out twice.
Is there a problem?
Hold on a second here.
Johnny who?
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
Who are you again?
Roper, we're into it...
Roper...
Being faxed over now.
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
Solis said to keep you clear of this.
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
Earl.
That's right.
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
Hi, Roper.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
Spread it out.
Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
Shut the fuck up and do what I say!
Open your shirt.
You can't kill me like this.
I'll give you something.
No. You just do shit for me right now.
For now that's all.
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.
Are you in charge, Roper?
Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
You don't have to come here.
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
Only that floor.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
She's the one to blame. Not me.
I ain't interested in your life story.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
True.
System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
-- You've made your point!  You've got control of the system.
Yes, I believe he has --
God-Damn you!
-- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?
They have nothing to do with this --
Yes.
There are two million people in there with you.
I need to take back what's mine.
What do you need?
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
What do you want?
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
This is Halden.
-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
Why --
Because I took it out of your memory.
How come I can't remember?
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
She said I have a son...
To live forever.
Why?
It's all been transferred.
Okay...
It's okay.
From the dream.
Wake up?!
It's time to wake up.
Nothing, go back to sleep.
What's happening?
That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
But this is impossible.
Just like you always wanted.
Guests?
The guests are here.
Yes.
It's all here...
No...
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
Someone who believes in miracles.
Who are you?!
About what?
You were right.
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
Do you believe in miracles?
-- If your life's so good up there Gena, what are you doing down here?
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
Your life that bad?
-- No.
This is how you pick up women --
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
And down here --
Only up there in the dream they called life.
But once the system touches the net, all links are severed.  Everybody dies.
One would assume so.
Until you're on the net where the corporation can't touch you, you can't open the system.  They'll eject it if you do.
Yes.
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  Redwood forests.  Oceans. Mountains --
Me?  Of course not.  That's why you're here.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
Dream?!
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
Yes...
You were the one who was dying.
Not real?
It's not real.
The new world.
In a computer program.
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
In here I am.
You are not a God.
Yes.
Divinity?
So wrong --
Not my problem.
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.
Then what?
No.
Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.
True.  But why?
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
-- He will.
But what if he doesn't --
It's his nature.
You sure he's going to come?
Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
And what about the reconfiguration?
Unfinished business.
Where the hell are you going?
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
-- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
The maze has been changed --
Have the staff apologize profusely and issue credit vouchers.  But remember, it's a capacity problem.  That's all.
What about the customers with reservations?
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
At least a day.
How long?
We're going to have to reconfigure.
How long 'till we can eject?
Take care?  Where the hell are you going --
Take care.
There is no --
The woman you're stuck on.
Who?
What's her name?
The weather.
What?
I'm South Dakota.
New York.
Where you plugged-in from?
If she's alive, you get it back.
Insurance?
Insurance.
Need the disk back!
Times Square.
Where?
An interface attendant.
Come on Tanner, think this through.
Then where is she?
There was no need to kill her.
Try harder.
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
To hide the evidence.
Why would I do that?
Then you had her killed.
Katie was digitized.
Not his style.
The truth.
What did he tell you?
-- Who did he digitize?!
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
Who did he digitize?
Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
Good question.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
That's right.
Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
He wouldn't say.
Why?
Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric.  He insisted it be kept vacant.
It's not used for anything.
A hotel?
The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
What is it?
The truth.
What?
One condition.
-- Christoph changed the maze.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.
Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
And you weren't involved.
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
-- I saw the program.
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
Try harder.
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
You're jumping to conclusions.
Go!
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
-- Yes.
He had access to the keys --
-- He won't.
Won't be time if he gets access --
Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
Two maze runners.
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.
He had keys.
Sorry?!
Not you.  A copy.
I know.
What?
Yes.
You weren't real.
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
It was a test.
Once they digitized you, they added it.
Yes.
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
Corporation can.
Identical.  One's you.  One's digital.
Night City.
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
-- You told me.
No.
-- Katie.
No.
I've got to get back.
Cleaning up a mess.
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Just like that --
Just like that?
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
There?
It was just there.
Try me.
Because you'll never believe me.
Why not?
This.  No point to it.
What's so funny?
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Don't know what you're talking about.
You don't need a lawyer.  We found the program on your laptop.
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?

IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
WE CAN'T BREAK FREE!
We get Ivan into the Comets PATH--
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
It's passing over earth as we speak!  Trajectory coordinates are 009843.
Wait a second...  What time is it?
He's on us!!
Speed?
We've got him locked!
Zordon...  he's gone.
What?!
Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late.
How can we reach Phaedos?
Ay, yi, yi, yi.  The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos... This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
Stylin'!
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
Now tell me... what do you see?
Wow.  Sand.
It will not harm you.
Yeah, right.
In the language of the Nathadians, "Nin" stands for "man", "jetti" stands for "animal".  Ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one.  Now, put your hands inside the flame.
Ah... sure.
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
So how can we get to it?
They're called squirbs.
Is this... food!
OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
I've got it!  We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
Release the power with the power.
There should be a way to open it.
We've come all this way for a rock wall?!
I've never been this sore in my life.
I can hardly walk...
Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
... What's happening to him?'
I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
I heard that!
Everybody hold on tight.  We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION!
1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!
What does that mean?!
Release the power WITH the power.
Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything.
That's pretty bad.
Activating Power Beam!
Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
WHITE TIGER!
SABER TOOTH TIGER!
... Let's take a look over there.
Anybody see anything?
Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!
Ay, yi, yi!  The Rangers are going to be CRUSHED!
... I just pray we're not too late.
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
... We must try to communicate with them.
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers...
Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
About twenty seconds in your time.
What's a Triac?
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
I see... a fox
In another time, another dimension.  It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies.  For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished.
Where did it originate?
It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.
This guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!
All systems go!
NINJA WOLF ZORD!
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
I think so.
You okay?
TRICERATOPS!
PTERODACTYL!
THERE'S THE COMET!
009843... 42... 41!  WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT!
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
Ryan's Comet!!
Two thirty three a.m.
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
NEW POWER COINS!!
Release the power with the power.
... Nothing.
We can take these guys!
That's the only way to the Monolith...
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
LET'S FLY!
I'm in!
Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
Let's go after him!!
Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.
... Not bad.
BULK!!
SKULL!!
A real shame.
There goes the neighborhood.
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
There's enough for everybody!
Here you go!  No pushing!
A stellar idea, Skull.
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
We could smell it's breath.
The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
And how do we release the power?
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
... A falcon?
Look closer.
It's... an eagle?
By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
And how do we do that?
SECOND COUSIN, THREE TIMES REMOVED.  NOW  GET OFF ME!
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
GET OFF ME!
Wait for me!
I'm outta here.
Did I say anything?
Just shut your gap!
How about Major Moron?
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
Hey, boss!
Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention...
We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
GO IVAN!!
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
You forgot to say 'Simon says."
What!
Quack like a'duck!
Simon says...
Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
But boss, what about their parents?
Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
You want me to place a few calls?
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric HORNITOR!  KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY.  ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD
What is THAT!
Dulcea!  That miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!
How'd you know?
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
Well... we were about to finish them off... when this huge monster came out of nowhere!
What do you mean "basically"?
"Basically".
So they've been destroyed?
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--
Mordant, go with them and report back to me!
We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
That was a CHEAP shot!
GO POWER RANGERS!
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions!
Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me!
Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
NINJA FALCON ZORD!
NINJA APE ZORD!
LET'S DO IT!?
THREE SECONDS!!
And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!
I am the mighty ape!
Strength in numbers!!
Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.
What's going on?!
How the heck?!...
Activating Power Scope!
Anybody see them?
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
You own a hotel, sir?
Sir, we do not use such names at our hotel.
And I ain't no nigger either!
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
There seems to be some confusion about your registration. I believe I can find you a place at the Ambassador. Many persons of the Jewish faith find it quite...
Awwh, Charlie.
But I've never served a day.
What are ya tellin' me, Charlie?
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left!
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
But ya got a Boss.
One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
And a lot more. Can we talk?
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
So Chicago's been good to ya.
But not you.
I remember reading a poem in college. "Sicily. Poor, noble isle...".
The goddamned bastards.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
Not another word.
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
You scare me, Charlie.
Whatever you say, Boss.
But from now on it's Lucky's spot.
Up here, Boss.
Scared.
What do you mean?
I guess I am. Just a little.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
No. Not everything.
And now you have everything.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
Life knocked me back.
So what happened?
I had everything. Once.
Why should I be?
Are you frightened?
Don't worry. I got friends to take care of that.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
I got my partner in there!
Could we step outside?
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
When my money moves, I go with it.
If we have to.
We could lose the deal!
He's got a line on the good stuff.
From your mouth ta God's ear.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
What's that divided four ways?
Four-twenty-eight.
Can't we get a couple whores over?
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
But if ya can't catch the guys...
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
He was around...
Shane was a friend of yours?
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
Maranzano. Ta ice you.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
How's Bugsy doin'?
We got our boys paintin' the house next door. Around the clock. We're gonna keep old man Profaci alive if it takes twenty coats.
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
The deal's too good, Frankie
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
That ain't what your mama said.
You ain't even a man yet.
Long as Charlie says.
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
I thought we just wanted to be left alone to run our business.
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
That's it.
Well...
Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
I'm gonna lose you, Charlie.
But there's...
Charlie?
Would it be painful for you?
You must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
My friends have a country house we can use for a while.
I booked passage to London.
So you all make the same mistakes?
You could have stopped him.
Why? You're the innocent one.
It's too late.
It's a mask.
You're sure?
I needed to see you again.
I was calling yesterday.
I'm already late.
I must be going.
No. I'm here with you.
For being a man.
No. They envy you.
Inside, they were talking of you.
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
Who'll make the rules?
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
Charlie!
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
They don't give a shit about us!
Come off it, Bugs.
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
You disrespect our tradition.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
The terms will be mine.
We must be friends, Charlie.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
No worry, Charlie. I will kill them for you. No one will know.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.
Coming with me will be a delicate matter. We will work it out. But Charlie...
We learn from life.
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
Share with them as you wish. Do business with them on your own. But no filthy Jew will ever be a brother to me.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
You get fifteen percent.
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
He's an animal!
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
And how many soldiers do you have?
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
I must know more of you, my son.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
A peaceful and prosperous retirement.
Bring order out of chaos. If you lead... they'll follow.
So change it.
The Big Picture.
Strategy.
A hundred years ago Austria was run by a prince named Metternich. Austria was weak, and it's neighbors were strong. But they were ruled by passionate men, while Metternich was ruthless and brilliant. If one country got too strong, he rallied an alliance against it. He would lead all of Europe to the brink of war, then bring the enemies together and forge the peace.
Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
That's just what they're calling ya pal. Lucky Luciano.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
Maranzano wants you dead.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
Fuck 'em.
Hell. It's been four days!
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
Where's the stiff?
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
I think these rich shits -- no offense Bobby -- are so dead below the waist that they gotta ride around all day swingin' at each other ta get their broads hot.
Wanna know what I think?
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Now that's a hard number.
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Anything ain't a very hard number.
Anything!
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Kill them! Kill them!
What a cozy little scene.
Open a window. Every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
Luciano is dead?
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
Yes?
This is nice. I mean it.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
You're fuckin' crazy.
A Jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
Kinda early for Christmas, Bugs.
Take any one ya like.
Guess so. Ya got a minute? I got somethin' for ya.
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
Best we got.
That a Jew compliment?
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
Just wanted ta say hello.
Jeez, Bugsy. Ya like ta scared the crap outta me.
They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with?
Monkeybone?
What?
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Who did this?
Special occasion?
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
Sad commentary, huh?
Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here.
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Olive or eyeball?
Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Thank me next time you see me.
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
Well - you'd need a body.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
<u>Why</u>??
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
At the moment, yes.
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.
Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
You're really gonna pop the question?
And last...you remember Bill here, from the Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something I think you'll like.
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
How much?
Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
Less.
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
What's the matter?
A piata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!
...In some weird way I respect that.
Oh my God...you're proposing?
Why?
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
Holy shit.
Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
Heirloom? Huh? You want a <u>used ring</u> - ?
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
I need a new PR guy.
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
Got a doctor on duty.
Ohhh, nothing.
<i></i> In what way?
Sure. Why?
Bitchin' good cake.
Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.
Give me a date, Doctor.
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
<u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
Don't ask where I got it.
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
Hypnos?
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
You want to come inside?
Is there something else I can do for you?
That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City.  We do not allow his kind on this block.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
Who told you we deal drugs?
We like to think so, yeah.
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
I just need to use the phone, lady.
... Manly?
Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice.
What does he do?
What happened?
Really?
And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.
I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
Thirty is base price.  Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.
Forty-five all total.
Yeah.  Not far.  You will be fine.  It's still day.
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
Moscow.
Yeah.
... Oh ...
So, you come here all by yourself?
And where is she?
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
Where to?
Swell. Thanks very much.  Good luck, Senator. Keep your left up.
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
But it *isn't*?
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
You've never *seen* this contract.
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
It was?
--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!
Let's send out a pigeon!
Positively not in the station! Gone!
What's he bringing pigeons for?
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
How do you feel, champ?
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
"Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it.  Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a--
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
A dirty frame!
Jeff for Senator.
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!
Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
Certainly. Step right in.
Yes. Come in.
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
In view of the gentleman's touching concern for the Senators, would he permit a motion to recess until the morning--at which time he could continue to educate this august body with his profound babblings?
Will the Senator yield for a question?
Is he fully aware that this bill has been months in both Houses--delayed and delayed--millions will be without food and shelter until its passage-- public works to relieve unemployment will be at a standstill--government agencies will be forced to suspend-- ?
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
Will the Senator yield?
I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or--
Mr. President!
Where were you?
Just fine.
Certainly would, Joseph.
Fine--
Hello, Jefferson.
What?
Satan's in this little fella tonight!
Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
Jefferson--
Well--I'll go to Halifax!
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
A camp! Well!
Ah! That's more like it! What?
Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?
If the Senator permits this motion to recess he will not have the floor in the morning to babble or anything else, unless he is recognized first by the Chair.
The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
Ring the call to quorum.
Order, gentlemen!
That is merely your *impression*, Senator. The Chair has yet to settle the question to its own satisfaction!
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
Senator, you can talk all you want to, now.
"I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."
The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
How's that, buddy?
Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language?
Great!  The Government's putting dough in too many places *now*!
Marvelous! And what would this camp set the Government back?
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
Swell!
One moment, friends, let's give the Senator a break.  Now, where'd you say you studied law?
Okay. See you here.
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
What do I *mean*, huh? Uh--*I'll* tell ya--World's Series--a pass! In a month it's worth fifteen bucks!
Saunders--it's meat and drink--lemme at 'im! Five minutes--! I'll make it right with you!
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Order!
Order!
Senator Paine will state it!
Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Senator Paine.
Certainly.
Put that away, slug!  At your service!
Some people like it.
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.
Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
Who's that?
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
Deeds?
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
He sure is.
He's still pixilated.
Yes, indeedy.
Oh, yes.
Uh-huh.
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
Always.
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
Yes, you own it.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
He sure is pixilated.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
And sings.
Sometimes he whistles.
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
Uh-huh.
Pixilated.
Oh yes, pixilated.
They think he's pixilated.
Sometimes twice.
Most every day.
He was a seven-months baby.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Since he was born.
Thank you very much.
No, no children.
Yes, sir.
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
I haven't.
No.
Come on - let's go!
Ow! My foot's asleep!
Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.
Boy, was he burning.
Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
Shhh!
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
Hurry up!
Come on, come on!
Right.
I tell you that dame's nuts.
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
Yes, but you said
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh
John
Let me go!
We'll send for the police!
I wanna see that guy!
He's not home, I tell you!
Let me go! I wanna see him!
You can't come up here!
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
Come on, John. What happened?
Better wire him right away, John.
Mr. Cedar!
You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
Mr. Cedar!
Proceed.
He's what?
Must we have the echo?
Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
Miss Bennett please!
Okay.
Yeah?
All set.
Where?
Yes?
He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.
No, I'm his housekeeper.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
No - he's over to the park arranging for the bazaar, so's to raise money for the fire engine.  Mal, you shoulda knowed he was in the park.
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Naturally.
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
We provide opera.
Why, it's an artistic institution
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
It takes so long to detect them  because their mood changes so often and so quickly. Now, Your Honor, may I show you? May I use the chart?
Ja.
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Uh-huh.
You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
my wife wanted me to tell you she  she prays for you every night.
Oh, Mr. Deeds
Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.
Sure - everybody's a moocher to you. A mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you!
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
Look, he's temperamental.
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
Proceed.
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
Please, Mr. Cedar!  Proceed.
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
Not at all.
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
A what?
Proceed.
Take the stand!
Yes?
Over at that big round table. The one that looks like a poodle.
Brookfield just came in.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
Yes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen, you play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in New York. We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet  thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
The difference between them and me is I know when I've been a skunk. You take me to the nearest news- stand and I'll eat a pack of your postcards raw. Raw!
Say fellow, you neglected me - and I feel very put out.  Look, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married
How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
I don't know.
South Dakota - but on the top.
South Dakota north.
Yes, ma'am.
Christian Svenson.
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
Were you supposed to have a session?
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
Could you come with me please?
Dr. Mumford.
But you do therapy?
You're the shrink, aren't you?
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?
You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something?
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
So... the University of Kentucky. Who runs the program down there?
...And I from Phyllis.
What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...
You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
Thank you.
I think he's got a point.
Ernest, what do you think?
What an asshole!
As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
About you... your background and your qualifications. I'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board.
Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
Interesting approach. What was his name?
I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
What are you doing for lunch?
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
Maybe you can empathize with this -- Maximum fine. Three months in jail, three months house arrest. Sentence to begin immediately at the Orchard Valley Correctional Facility. Case closed. This court is adjourned.
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
What?
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
Do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people?...
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better.  Let's go, Vanessa.
Did you straighten her out?
Hiya, Doc.
No... sort of. Man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. She's blowin' them in the parking lot.
What's wrong with her?
Got to.
Can you help Mom?
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
Got a license?  But no car?
But you know how to drive?
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
What kind of doctor are you?
Do you think that's a good idea?
What's happening here?
Mumford... like the town?
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Well, look who's here...
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
-- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.
Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.
I think you do.
I think you know what I mean.
Finally, some common sense...
What?
What'd you want?
Oh... not a real doctor.
Yes... your particular approach.
That was a terrible thing.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
When?
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
Priests. Imhotep's priests.
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
If he arrives before us, it will be too late.
And then killing your sister.
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
To have stopped this creature? Yes!
Do you truly wish to know? Or would you prefer to just shoot us?
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
Perhaps.
Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
The key!? She has the lost key!?
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
If we want to kill the creature, yes.
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
Correct, And that's when --
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
According to the ancients, cat's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld. Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing.
You will not believe it.
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
What did you do to him!?
You bastards!
Water turning to blood.
The sun turning black.
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.
A bright good morning to all.
Forty.
Fifty percent.
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
You lie.
Proceed!
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
No women allowed.
To be hanged.
He said... he was just looking for a good time.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
What --?
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
And what's that?
Except for one little thing.
Um-hmm.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
I know that you're recruiting your old henchmen...
Really?
The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.
Of course.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
I know you knew I'd know.
I knew you'd know.
I know you did.
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
Do I?
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
You two timing psychotic bastard.
I'll be down in a jiffy.
Our guests are waiting.
One last tweak.
I thought you were done?
Fantasizing... about you.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
Head hunting.
Where are you going?
Don't worry, Pootchkie. My womanizing days are over. You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my Nicole.  We're such an incredible team. Who could possibly stop us?
Your mind is so slippery.
It must have slipped my mind.
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
Hey, do I look like a Man?
Atta, boy!
Do it, big boy!
We could really use some coffee --
Much less go outside.
I was eight.
He was the last time I saw him.
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
The Disco Boys.
And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.
Really?
I'm his daughter.
Or even what it looks like.
Sounds good to me.
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
Come on, Junior, it's a school night.
It's late. I'm headin' home.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
But you're a superhero.
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
How about... the Savage Six?
He was cute though.
I'm the Bowler.
Eat your mustard.
Hey... you okay?
Mon Captain, it's for you.
What did he mean?
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
I thought you'd never ask.
Think positive.
He'll never make it.
Get on to yourself!
Snap out of it!
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy.
He's dead.
How's your dad?
Thanks.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
It's me... Elizabeth.
Yes!
Doctor Heller?
Yes!
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
That boy's got talent.
Why bother?
Should I kill them?
Superheroes.
What about Captain Amazing?
I got it.
But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
Have you considered my offer?
Ummm.
I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
And the light goes out...
You're dead.
Too bad. PLUG HIM!
Are you with me... or against me?
They always call the great ones nuts.
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
Captain who?
Or you'll what? CAN ME?
Roy.
I saw him walk you home.
You're a spy.
Remember the cat.
Then why are you here?
Come here.
Me.
Why not?
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
Terrific.
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
You underestimate yourself.
Are you an actress?
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
I just know.
Yes.
Yes.
He is in love. His anger is gone.
Now you're talking.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
When I am sure I am among friends.
You drink too much.
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
And you are a fool.
Hey... he's gone.
Anybody got any?
The Obliterators!
Yes.
No.
Yes.
Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
I always knew that you were special.
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
But... the silverware?
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
It's on the television.
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
Jeffrey!
Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
Look, let me be completely open with you, I have a carriage and an escort waiting for me, and I have a great deal of money outside of France. Unless we stand a very good chance of carrying this off, I am prepared to call it quits right now.
You realize what is at stake?
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
These are odds of 8 to 1.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
There are none here.
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
About 5,000 troops.
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down.
Please...
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
Yes -- who spoke up?
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
I don't know, sire.
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked.  The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men.  Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.
The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
It is on this road, sire, following me.
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
No, sire... I was asleep.
Yes, sire?
Bertrand, sire.
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
That is incredible.
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
It is a terrible shock.
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
General Bonaparte?
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
Thank you, sir.
No, sir, none at all.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, I am.
Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
Just a minute, General.  Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da.  They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.
I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
Have you been back recently?
Bastia -- and you?
I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
Yes, sir?
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
When you eat him, may I have some?
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
Why are you carrying the dog?
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
Hello there, Picart.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
It is the work of incendiaries.
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
The first reports came in at about ten.
Four o'clock.
May I suggest that we can prepare and sign the agreement, between ourselves, subject to the approval of the two Emperors.  Believe me, my dear friend, your Archduchess, Marie-Louis, may very well hold, in her hands, the future of our two countries.
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
What is that?
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
Oh?
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
No, sir.
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
No -- not as a rule.
Thank you, Napoleon.
Thank you.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
I very much doubt that he will.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
I believe so.  I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
Yes, of course.  What do you want?
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
Yes.
Yes.
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
I know.
God help me -- yes.
My God, what do you think?
About Hippolyte Charles.
I couldn't face telling you.
Yes, I wrote it.
I wrote it.
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
There are some things... better left unsaid.
Let's just say, he looks after your interests.
That's all I can say.
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
He's downstairs -- somewhere.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
There's probably some explanation.
I believe you sent for me.
No, one cannot simply ignore it.
If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
And where do you place Alexander?
What I am talking about is moderation.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
Has Alexander agreed to this?
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
Very well, Citizen Lieutenant.  You have come to the right place, for I am Citizen Varlac.
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
A message from Citizen Fouche.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Yes, sir.
Eugene de Beauharnais.
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer.
Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
Go, fo' I change my mind.
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
Okay, I know what I want this time.
Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
Can I look for myself?
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
No we didn't.  We came to buy a CD.
We didn't come here for Day-Day.
Who are you?
Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife stays here, of course.
Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
Could you hurry up, please... it's kinda hot out here.
Delivery!
Delivery!
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
Peace out, Craig.
See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
I said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it -- rowdy, rowdy?
My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
I don't have no damn cover.
No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
I can't get jiggy with this shit.  Where is the damn manager?
Tape his mouth shut.
Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?
I don't believe this sugar shit. Something ain't right.
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
What the fuck you looking at?
I don't know.
Hey, how you get out of here.
Good, let's get out.
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
Huh?
Ezal!  Ezal!
I don't know.
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
I can't feel my legs no more.
What?
Debo!  Debo!
Keep pushing.
You too big.
Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call.
William.
I don't know the number.
Just do it.
That ain't gonna work.
If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call.
What urgent message?
Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
Get on!
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
Get on.
Yeah.
Rancho Cucamonga?
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
What you say?
I don't know, Debo.
Where did Craig move to?
Yeah, and hurry up.
Take your car.
Nothing.  What you want?
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
I'll take you later.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Elroy, what happen?
Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here.
Mr. Nasty time?
Ah, baby...I thought this was you.  Craig, what are you doing to me?
Huh?
Okay.  Bye, Craig.
Elroy.
Oooh, ba-by!
I've been a bad boy.
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
That's my girl.
Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
What happened here?
Who, him? Just visiting.
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
It's an important speech.
Oh, yeah?
The grave. Somebody close?
Somebody close?
Aw, too bad.
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
'S okay. What do you think?
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
Where'd you come from?
Business or pleasure?
You just come in on Amtrack?
Amtrack?
Where to, sir?
I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
I think you're right.
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
It's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances.
I don't know.
I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked.
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
Is that something precious?
No, kisses to...
No...kisses to you.
I promise.
All right.
To be a hero?
Can we go now?
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
Right.
Nods.
No way.
On TV.
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
Fuck you!
Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!
You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
Hey!
Fuckin' A.
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
Could I see it?
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
I see. Where is this gun?
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
What?
He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not?
A surprise?
I've got something for you.
Why?
Close your eyes.
I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby.
You're a big girl, huh?
I'm not a baby.
Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all.
Where are we going?
That's good.  That's good, sweetie pie.
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
You have, huh?
I've done much better ones than this.
That's pretty good.
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
It goes in that little hole.
Laughs.
This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!
Yep. And you can listen to it without anybody else listening. Let's try it out.
Everybody does?
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference.
You stole that.
It's time. It's time now.
Get moving.
Where is he? Did you lose him?
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
It better be.
It doesn't look like it.
You got this under control?
What gives?
Yeah.
Yeah.
'Daddy has to go now.
Go ahead, sugar Die.
Only you.
I kill her anyway.
Come with me, honey.
Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
Young love.
Where?
What about them?
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
That one.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
What do you figure he done with it?
No.
He never told about the money.
He carried on some; kicked.
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
No.
Any trouble?
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
You killed two men, Ben Harper.
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
No, Ben.
Ben, I'm a Man of God.
Don't!
If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
Tell you why I ask -- your step-pa being' a Preacher an' all...
Do you mind me cussin', boy?
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
There hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook Mister Gar. What a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.
Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- any time.
Leavin', boy?
How's your sister Pearl?
And the times that are gone by. I'll have her ready inside of a week; and then we'll go fishin'. How's your Maw?
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
Pshaw now! Ain't it a caution what women'll load onto a feller's back when he ain't lookin'?
Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.
Ain't nobody goin' to neither, long as Uncle Birdie's around.
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
She went.
Where's Ruby?
They hid in a broom closet!
And when little King Jesus' Ma and Pa heard about that plan, what do you reckon they went and done?
It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
I'll light the lamp.
John: you go fetch Ruby.  Big Ruby's my problem girl. She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but Ruby's got mother hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?
She went.
Here's what you owe me.  One, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?
IN THE RIIV-ER!
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
Yes! Yes!
And the Lord told that man --
But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
Yes! Yes!
You have all sinned!
AAA-MENN!
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
The money, Icey.
There's something else.
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
John don't like him much.
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
Icey, I don't want a husband.
Thank you, no. Thank you, dear Icey. I'll tend to them. Thank you.
The devil wins sometimes!
I tried to save her.
She'd found this fruit jar of dandelion wine  that the husband -- Harper -- had hid somewheres in the cellar.  She was drinking.
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
The pitcher has went to the well once too often, my friends.
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
Satan.
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.
My, that fudge smells yummy!
I must wend my way down River on the Lord's work.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
I'll make coffee.
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
Well, shoot! Maybe there was!
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
Story, honey? Why, what story?
I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff from Parkersburg!
Where ye from?
Dead.
John, where's your folks?
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
Come to me, boy!
You could save him, little bird.
Now: Where?
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
Why sure, boy, sure.
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
All right...  Come along.
All right boy: where's the money?
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
The summer is young yet, little lad.  Pearl?
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
That wasn't very nice of you, John. Have a heart, boy.
Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.
Come on, children!
What's that you're playing with, boy?
What's taking you so long about it?
What are you doing, boy?
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
Tell me what, boy?
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
Did you hear what I said, son?
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
JOHN -- DOESN'T -- MATTER! Can't I get that through your head, you poor, silly, disgusting little wretch!
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
Why, pray tell?
About our secrets.
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
Naturally.
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
Where's the money hid.
O no! Your turn!
Yes; John's bad.
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
What's your name?
Sure, that's no secret.
How old are you?
Now it's your turn.
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
I'll tell you a secret.
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
Ahh!
Only she won't never let me play with it.
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
Pearl and John.
What's their names?
There's two new ones over at your place, ain't there Ruby?
No. No one never did.
Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?
O' course.
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
Can I have this?
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
She turned me out of the bed.
Our honeymoon.
Yes; from the first night.
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
A strange woman is a narrow pit!
Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
Answer me!
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
You were listening outside the parlor window.
I'm through, Harry.
Are you through praying?
Yes.
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
I -- no, I --
Do you want more children, Willa?
Get up.
Harry, what --
Get up, Willa.
I think it's time we got one thing perfectly clear, Willa. Marriage to me represents a blending of two spirits in the sight of Heaven.
No, Harry! I thought --
You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
I was praying.
Harry!
Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
I'm givin' you to the count of three to get out that screen door; then I'm a-comin' across this kitchen shootin'!
None of your business, Madam.
What are you after them for?
Them kids!
What do you want?
Didn't you hear me, boy?
What's wrong, John?
What's wrong, John?
The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
The Lord will provide.
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
She took them kids with her?
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
Where's she at?
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
Where's your Missus?
My flesh and blood!
Them kids is yours?
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
It's about that John and that Pearl?
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
How'do.
Mornin', ladies.
The man! The man!
What?
Miz Cooper!
John and Pearl!
Pearl and John.
What'd you all talk about?
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
He never asked me for nothin'.
Now who was this?
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
I been out with men.
What you been up to?
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
The Drugstore?
This man down at the Drugstore...
When did I ever?
You'll whip me!
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
I been bad!
Not this time! It was just one youngin -- a little boy babe. And do you know who he was, children?
Pearl and John!
Get the kit!
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
Okay, good. She's asleep.
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
How long's this been going on?
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
Sure, but...
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
Nan, I --
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
Hello Nancy.
It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep.
No, I know, thanks to your own testimony, that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag.
He's dangerous.
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
Decide to take a day off after all?
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
What?
You got a sane explanation for what he did?
How you doing, pal?
'Anything funny' like what?
Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
I don't mean her --
She lived there.
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
What's the Coroner got to say?
I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?
Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --
Like Rod Lane?
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
Maybe god's punishing us all...
Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room!  Sorry. Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams.
How you know that?
Had to've done it. No one else was in there.
Krueger?
Krueger.
Who? Who did that?
Do you think I did it?
I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
No.
How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
Someone else was there.
I never touched her.
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
What you dream?
Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
Yeah, nuts.
Rod says the sweetest things.
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
When did you have a nightmare?
Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
No more fights.
No more fights?
Jungle man fix Jane.
You feel better now, right?
Of course. What's that?
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
What the hell you doing here?
From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
What is it, Ninotchka?
Naturally, Comrade.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Thank you, Comrade.
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Monsieur.
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
Very well, Your Highness.
A blue shirt, perhaps?
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Good morning, Your Highness.
Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
No, sir.
No, sir.
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
Eight forty-two, sir.
Your breakfast, monsieur.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
Good evening, Monsieur.
Certainly.
Yes.
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
Your Highness...
Is this satisfactory?
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
It is only a small table but it will be no trouble to put in some extra chairs.
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
Good evening, Your Highness.
Yes, monsieur.
But, gentlemen, I am afraid...
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
Monsieur.
Yes, monsieur?
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.
Yes. It is unfortunate.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
That depends on the tip.
Well... that's my business, madame.
May I have your bags, madame?
Here, please...
That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch  la Pre Mathieu.
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, not a meadow.
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
Eight blocks down in the Rue de Poivrel.
It's just a place for workmen.
At Pre Mathieu's.
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
Where to, madame?
I am sorry... I have to leave.
This morning three Soviet agents arrived. I overheard a telephone conversation with Mercier, the jeweler. Your Highness, they are going to sell them!
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
Your Highness.
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
We could check the tape again, sir.
You did say it, sir.
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
Then his office will be fine.
He told me to take you to his conference room.
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute.
John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
I'll bet he would.
Yes ... I got the money.
Thou must find thy peace at the center, Richard.  Strength in this life.  Happiness in the next.
What about happiness, Mother?
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
Thou must.
I can't ...
Is it my turn?
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
Mother, think of me always as your faithful dog ...
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
I expect more from thee, Richard.
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning.
Harold may have lost touch with his Bible, but thou must never lapse.
Yes, Mother ...
Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.
Why me?
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it?  I want to go home, Dick.  Time to go home.
Harold ... can I get you anything?
Mom expects great things from you ...
Go to law school.  Mom and Dad'll be able to afford it now ...
What ... ?
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
What'd you say?
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
What'd he say?
Ummm...
... little Bobby.
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack?
I won't tell him if you won't.
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
Where'd you find him?
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
Who we working for?
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
You're fucking me.
The White House.
Why, you got a customer?
They're around.
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
How the fuck did you know?
Personally, I'll be calling the President of the United States.
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Mein Kampf?
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
How a fat man gets so many girls.
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
Yes.
He was a politician.
That was Mr. Kennedy.
Yes, Mr. President.
Of course.
I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you?
The real war is in us.  History is a symptom of our disease.
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
You know, I voted for you in your last election.
That has the added virtue of being true.
Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
Looks can be deceiving ...
How about Kissinger along with him?
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
... Use his women.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
Mr. Nixon.
But it was all we had.
... give me a break, Mary.
Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
What you have to understand, Mr. Nixon, is that we are willing to die for what we believe in.
Ernie Davis.
Syracuse.
You're shittin' me.
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
Elvis I like, too.
I like jazz ...
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
Hi.
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
Then what's the point?  What's the point of being president?  You're powerless.
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
Or we could write "expletive deleted."
Well, we could delete it.
No, sir ...
Yes, yes.
Sir?
Compassionate.  Grateful.
POWs.  And their families.
That's right.
Sir?
Bernstein.
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
We got the press this time!
Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
That don't hardly say it. He shoots the desk clerk one day, and walks right back in the next and shoots a retired army colonel.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
He's real all right.
Well what would you call him.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
None of that explains your man though.
Try "old" on for size.
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well...
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
Yes Sheriff.
He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
...How'd you sleep?
Lord no. I'm not retired.
I can't plan your day.
Okay.
Don't hurt no one.
Don't get hurt.
...Be careful.
That's very nice.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
I thought it was a car afire.
Well I didn't see it.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
Hello?
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
Sir I ain't at liberty to give out no information about our residents.
I can't say.
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
Did you go up to his trailer?
Yessir?
Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
Well -- where ya goin'?
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
No me mate.
Not a bleep.
In the truck.  I'll get it.
Mm-hm.
Huh? What is...
What's this about?
I see.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
Nobody. Accounting.
...Me?
No sir, it's unusual.
Okay.
I'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
That's twenty-six dollars.
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
What kind of tent?
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
You already have the tent?
Tent poles.
They'll give you a wallop.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
Let's just call it square.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
What room?
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
Yes?
You seem pretty sure of yourself. You've led something of a charmed life haven't you Mr. Wells?
He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
That's not an answer.
How well do you know Chigurh.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
When did you last see him.
I do like you.
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
What else then?
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
I got beers in my room.
That's got two double beds.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
Another additional.
You want to change rooms?
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
The option.
You tell me the option.
What outfit.
Nam?
Are you in the service?
Don't jack with me.
Are you jackin' with me?
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
That is correct. And how do I decide?
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
Uh-huh.  Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I just fucking love pastels.
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
You must be joking.
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
Great. Good. Content...
Need something else?
You know, flags and shit... he said "for a livelier look" or something.
Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.  He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?
Good. I'm prepared to offer you a job. You can help out in the pharmacy until your California certification and references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. Is that totally clear?  Fine...
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
...I don't think I know that hospital.
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
Really. And where was that, old man?
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
The fuck you talking about?
Huh?
Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
Betty was a lovely child.
This is Betty at twelve.
...who doesn't?
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
Oh, five years, give or take.
Sure.
Better.
Uh-huh.
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Because it ain't natural, young man.
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school.
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!...
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
What did you say?
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
Blah -- blah -- blah... Hurry up, will ya, I got a date tonight...
No... before that.
Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
Loma Vista?  You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?"
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
And thank you as well for that conversational hiatus; I generally refrain from speech while engaged in gustation. There are those who attempt both at the same time but I find it course and vulgar. Now where were we?
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
Sales, Mr. McGill, sales! And what do I sell? The Truth! Ever' blessed word of it, from Genesee on down to Revelations! That's right, the word of God, which let me add there is damn good money in during these days of woe and want! Folks're lookin' for answers and Big Dan Teague sells the only book that's got 'em! What do you do - you and your tongue-tied friend?
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
The law. Well the law is a human institution.
- and share one of your graves.
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
- but now it deposits you here.
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Campaign manager? Waldrip.
What's his name again?
Assa good idea, Pappy.
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
Problem a p'seption.
Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies braggin' on our own midget! Don't matter how stumpy! And that's the goddamn problem right there - people think this Stokes got fresh ideas, he's oh coorant and we the past.
Okay, Pappy.
I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch!
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -
Not out the other side his face, though.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
Vernon T. Waldrip.
Vernon Waldrip.
Powas p'suasion.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Helluva idea.
Wipin' little circles with his bread...
Pullin' ah pants down...
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
Ass right.
Helluva awgazation.
Devil his due.
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
Suckin' away.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Latch right on to that tit.
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Them straw polls is ugly.
Oh Lord yes, any parish'r precinct; I was makin' the larger point.
In any state.
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
I am. Hur you?
Oh mercy, yes. You gotta beat that competition.
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
It was a powerful air.
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.
They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
Well I guess folks don't mind they's integrated.
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
We ain't got a constichency! Stokes got a constichency!
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
...Yeah?
Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.
Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!
Buyin' nipples!
She's at the five and dime.
He's a suitor!
It's bona fide!
You got a maiden name, Daddy?
That's a maiden name.
Blooey!
Mama said you was hit by a train!
He ain't our daddy!
Daddy!
Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
Zack, we've got to go.
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
You're pretty funny, Mayo.
I don't mean anything by it.
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
A long time ago.
When did this happen?
Yes, Joe.
Esther, do you think she's using...  ...birth control?
Come over here where I can see you.
Joe!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!!
Yes, sir!
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --
What are you tired from?
I said, come here!
Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
He said he grew up poor?
Yeah. All week long.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
How do you figure that's your bunk?
The sentence that started "There are three."  What was the rest?
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
You don't look so good.
Can we come in?
We'd like to come in.
Can we come in?
'Bout four o'clock.
Everything okay?
Not at all.
That door is a safely hazard.
Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --
Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
Oh, I've seen these...
KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
Could the child please stop that?
Master closet.
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
Master bath.
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
No ball, kid.
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you --
Push that button for me, will you?
That's highly inappropriate.
Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.
A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A castle keep, in medieval times.
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
And with kids like he's got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide.
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
The furniture guy?
I don't think so, but I love her album.
Why?
What?
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
No cars.  Feet are faster.
-- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five feet deep, forty-two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back --
No...
Fuck that, we've got company...
Those ain't cops.
I'm okay... listen to me...  Let's go with Judge, check it out.
Tyrone...
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
For the last time Boy!!! What do those guns mean??!!
Well... is it loaded?
Lemme see that rifle son...
What are you doing with the gun?
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
You know it brother.
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE WANT?
Sure, those boojie jokers don't do anything except print up a lotta paper saying "Black is Beautiful."
What's up?
Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... You're gonna love...
Sit down, This concerns you too.  I don't need to say that your department's handling of the Black Panthers -- particularly Inspector Brimmer's "undercover operation" has been a complete travesty.
Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement.
They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
You know it. Stay Black...
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Hey... Cy... what now you a righteous Panther man, you too uppity to drink with us?
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Motherfucker... you stay away...
Man, fuck you!!!
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
I don't think that will be any problem...
Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
Rodgers... this is no good...
As far as Mr. Hoover is concerned the worst has happened, the Panthers have unified with other organizations -- most likely sponsored by communists -- to undermine the war in Vietnam.  By doing so, they have quite simply guaranteed their own extinction.
Jesus...
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
No I'm not. I'd like to say, frankly and off the record, that I resent the Bureau's presence here. "Advisory Basis" or not. And, once we get these boys put away and the Panthers permanently discredited, I'd appreciate it if you'd leave us to take care of our own. Now I'm finished.
Are you finished?
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...
Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
Now hold on Rodgers...
They couldn't have thought this up for themselves.
One: "We want freedom. We want the power to determine the destiny of our Black Community." Two: "We want full employment for our people." Three: "We want to end the robbery by the white man of our Black Community." Christ, they're asking for reparations...
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
You want me to put a man on it?
Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
Can you make a deal with them?
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
Did you shoot the officers in question?
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
No sir he didn't.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
Yes sir, I did.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Yes sir I was.
Yes, that's exactly what I mean. And Agent Rodgers?... This conversation never occurred.
You mean...
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
Well... like they say, there's a Panther born every minute in the ghetto. Uh... we seem to have "underestimated" the support of the Black community. It's their power base...
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
We're working on that...
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
Wait a second there brother...
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
Didn't want folks to think I was a snitch. You know?
Ain't no one seen him.
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
This cool the heat off you any?
Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...
Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
You believe that?
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
You don't look alright.
Thank you.
Late summer.
Good.
Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
You call that a compliment?
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
You got me beat on both accounts.
He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
Well?
Am I one of that sort?
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
Not many.  Dalton, Scott, they've got their reasons; Rev. Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks; a few like me with nothing to lose...  What about you?  You've got a lot to lose.
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
We've got plenty of baking powder. You went to Pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago.
You got salt last week.
Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
You don't know him very well, do you?
He's not making light.
Lovely.
Goodbye.
Very well, then.
Do you?
I said, I'm not my sister.
If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
You couldn't have known.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
As do you.
Thank you.
With a lace table cloth?
We did.
Who cared for your wounds?
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
What unit?
Yes, sir.
You're surrendering.
Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.
I understand, sir.
Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.
Probably.
Perhaps.
Are you going to meet with him?
Yes, sir.
Sir.
Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
I don't care.  I hate him.
He left us.
Nonetheless, I would like to know, Mister Marion, how... how... how...
I stand corrected.
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
Please.
An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?
Robert.  Robert E. Lee.
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
Goodbye, Francis.
No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
How many men have we seen die?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry...  ... including the Green Dragoons under Tarleton.
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
Not held, just slowed down.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
Fall, six months at the earliest.
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
We're a breath away from losing this war.  In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats.  Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back.  He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York.
I am, I think.
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
I'm sorry.
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
One of yours?
And your principles?
Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.
You said bribery twice...
That's five, keep going...
Name five hundred.
Balderdash!
I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
That's a damn long time...
A long time ago...
Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
I understood him to be a Patriot as well.
Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.
Yes... you will wait.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
But what about Thomas?
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
How far away?
Yes, he does.
Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...
About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
Thank you.
I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.
And what is the second thing?
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
Proud, priggish and competent.  A very bad combination in an adversary.
That bad?
Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis.
I've had no sons to lose, nor daughters.  I lose the sons of other men.
I was sorry to hear about your son.
Earned.
But father, they might come this way.
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
When?
I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad...
Father... I killed those men...
Father, you can't let them take him...
Father?
Father, I saw a post rider at the house.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
Remember.
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
Aye, aye, sir!
How does he do that?
I will.
That boat is my livelihood!
My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
You stole my boat.
Do you believe him?
I guess there is a reason to fret.
No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
Now?
That would hardly be proper.
You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
I know where your heart truly lies.
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
You're speaking up for him again?
Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
I'm a bit nervous, myself --
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
Very good.
Did he speak?
Fetch a hook -- haul him out of there!
Man overboard!
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know.
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
He said you say that!  He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked.
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
It would appear, so do you.
I know the code.
What?
How did you get off the island?
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
And you've got that, have you?
A fool's errand.
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
Say again?
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
Aye, that'll about do it.
Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
That we are.
It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
Ah -- he's learned, then.  Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England.  Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share.  So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too.  So Jack gave up the bearings.  That night, there was a mutiny.
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
Blast it, I'm already awake!
I don't think that will be necessary.
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
Raise the sails.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
I said, no lies.
What's your name?
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
You would do that?
I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
Indeed.
Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
Still --
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
He may be.
He's not telling the truth.
I think he's telling the truth.
And no lies!
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!
... no.
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
No.
... No.
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
Yes, I have.
You haven't seen it.
Yes.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
Yes.
You've seen it?
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
No, it's not.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!
Please.
But --
A moment.
Commodore --
Bleak.  Very bleak.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
No.  She hasn't.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
What happened here?
Where did he come from?
He's still breathing.
My apologies, Governor.
Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
No.  The captain of the containment crew is closing down the main lab. He says the area has got to be evacuated.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
Dr. Bright has escaped.
Speak.
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
You got it, Dr. Argon.
Mr. Sim, when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?
Until he's done.
How long do you leave him in there?
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
I look behind us, I look to the past, to a world steeped in rot and decay.  I think of the Acropolis in another century reduced to little more than dust.  I see the faces of Rushmore eventually losing all distinction, and then I look at this...
This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven.  Science is the quest for divine perfection.
Do you know what I see?  I see man making his own clouds.  I see man coloring his own sky, and like this garden it is a site that makes my heart sing.
I ask you what is the purpose of science?  What is the point of all our relentless exploration, investigation and experimentation? It is to understand a single physical phenomenon, or to understand them all?  To cure one disease, or to cure every disease? If science is simply a means, what then is the end?
I brought you up here, Dr. Bright, because I want you to understand that we are on the path.  The only difference is that you are walking with your head down, afraid to look up, to see where the path is going.
We will always love most that which we create.  Don't you agree, Susan?
You'll forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched.  Poppy?
Something to drink, Dr. Bright?
Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something.
To be brutally honest with you, Susan, as long as the nanobot does to me what it did to that idiot O'Brien, I don't give a rat's ass about what happens after that.
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
Mr. Sim I want you to return to Dr. Bright's.  I believe she is hiding something of ours there.
You don't have to give it to us because Dr. Nebbleman can just cut it out of him.
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that.
Wheelchair accessible.
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
You think you can use me to stop the meltdown.
I know what you're doing.
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
As you can see I am a new man, just like you.
How apropos.
Maybe you should, but you can't.
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
... plastic.
If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
Not that.
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Did you feel that?
Poppy, this is not the time!
If you loved me like I loved you?
Poppy, please --
What I asked you earlier?
Considering what?
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
I'm so excited, Icarus.
It will be an ascension.
Okay, arms up, lean forward.
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
Consideration?
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
Icarus?
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
Then you still love me?
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
Icarus, please!  This is important!
Why are there two ottomans?
You know how I feel about you.  You know how much I need you.  How much I trust you.  I would do anything for you.
No, Icky, this is real.
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him.
Do you think she loves him?
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
And you still believe he's going to come here?
That remains to be seen.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
Do you think she will give us the designs?
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
Nebbleman.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
Who cares!  We've got to find him! Hurry!
Icky!  What's happening?
Don't be a child, Icarus.  She is just another scientist and like all scientists, she doesn't care about anything outside the world of the laboratory.
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
She says it's not.
It's ready now, I know it is.
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
No.  I'm getting used to it.
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
Oh no?  Smell this.
You're not rotting meat.
Like rotting meat.
Donated to science.  Perfect.
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do.
Thank you, sir.
Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman.  You have outdone yourself.
Shut up and do it!
Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back --
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete?
They're here!  They're here!  We have the nanobot.
The trunk.
Where did he go?
Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
Poppy, order the trucks from the Gary plant.  And we're going to need a containment crew.
That might work.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
Facts, Dr. Nebbleman.  Facts. You've been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment, haven't you?
Cleaned up?  It can't be cleaned up! Without the nanobot the waste can't be stabilized!  That's what we've been trying to tell you!  The only thing we can do is run!  Run!  Run!
The fact is, that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up.
The nanobot is gone.
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.
I want Trix!  Mommy!
I like Trix!
Yeah, I do!
Hey!
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
You better quit pushing me, pal.
Why don't you just shove it up your ass!  Haw-haw!
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
Yeah?  So what?
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.
Who isn't?
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Of course, sir.
You're looking for a urine sample.
What are you going to do?
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
Well, you got another problem.
What did security say?
That's the guy?
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
What did he want?
A man?
Aaabout...?
Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
Susan!
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
So, I guess it worked.
Sir, please try to hold still.
Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!
Like Crazy Glue?
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
What's it smell like?
Okay.
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
Mr. Sim, watch out!  O'Brien escaped and could be on his way!
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Yes?
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
Oh yeah?
Yeah, and what might that be?
You were looking for us?
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
That's right.
Oh yes you are!
I'm real touched.  Now get your Sunday's on.  We're going for a ride.
We lost him.
And you have him?
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
It's a miracle.
That's impossible.
Don't worry, four eyes.
Icky!
I could have you fired right now.
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
While you remain on the staff at Argon Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon's priorities.  I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl like you to figure out.
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
He believes that the second nanobot should be ready for testing by now.
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
Vermin...
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it.
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!
Look! Look! The front page!
Ah-ah-ah!
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
Sit down!
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
What is this person doing here?
That's an excellent idea.
Oh, shut up!
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
Well, I got a seat, but I have no place to put it.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.
Oh, a party! Great, great! Jolly times and merry pranks. That's me. I'm a guy who loves parties. You know
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
Hello, there, Meadows![13]
I certainly will.
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
Oh yeah?
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about
Yeah!
Is that so?
Huh?
Is that so?
Well, I should say!
Oh, man!
Thanks, I will.
Yeah, hello. How are you?
What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
There's no catch. This is on the up and up. Of course all you have to do is just sign the article - by Anne Schuyler's Husband.
It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
I bring a message from Garcia.
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
Oh boy, I'd love it.
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
Oh, is that so?
Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition.
You newspaper people have a lot of fun with him, don't you? What is it you call him - the Cinderella Man?
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
That's a lovely dress.
Yes, of course. I'll get it for you
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
Okay - you remember Joe
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
I have. Double-strength!
Smythe, you've been drinking.
They've been ready for the last half hour.
Are the cars ready?
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
Double-strength!
Double strength!
Some bicarbonate - quick!
I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen?
What is it, Smythe?
Heavens! The man's insane!
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
And you struck him right here in our house?
To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers!
I beg your pardon?
Have you seen this?
This man's impossible! I can't talk to him. Grayson, let's go where we can talk - hic!  See what you've done to me!?
Stop calling me Mother!
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
Get out of here.
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.
Why
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousandand you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
Very good, sir.
Yes.
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
That's puttering, sir.
Well sir, I'll show you.
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
I just putter.
Well, sir, I putter.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
No, sir!
Me, sir?
Yes, sir.
Did you call, sir?
Yes, sir.
Well done, sir. Very neat.
But I
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
The name is Smythe.
I understand, sir.
Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
Yeah. It does.
But you can't go out there.
You can't go out there.
I don't know.
It's alright. Let me see.
It's alright.
Wait ...
No she's not.
What?
Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
Here's my favorite.
Bud brought it to me.
Well ...  Here's what it's s'posed to look like.
Having kind of a tough time.
Thanks.
No, no ... Come on in.
Oh, hi ...
Oh, hello Betty.
It's better, Mary Sue.
With what?
Why not?
We were gonna ... You know ...
It's six-thirty ...
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
It is?
I think ... I might be ill ...
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
Sure is pretty.
Lover's Lane!
But where would we go?
What?
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
Hunh?  Oh, right ...
... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.
Oh yeah.
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
She won't go out with me?
Yeah ... How'd you know?
What's the matter?
What?
No it couldn't!
That's not going to happen!
Okay, that's IT!!!
Oh. guess I could do that, then.
Well, I never had to do it before.
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
"It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."
What is it?
What's outside of Pleasantville?
And where's that?
How'd you know how to put it out and all?
How'd you know about the fire?
The other one?
Green.
Yes.
Hear your Dad got a new car.
Hello Bud.
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
Scout?
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
Just a little--You know.
Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
No, that's not it.
I'll never be able to do that.
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
Aren't you a little early?
Oh, hi.
Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
Really?
Well don't you?
Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
Christmastime.
You know what I really like?
Why?
Oh ... Okay.  ... But I really liked it.
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Well you weren't around this time so I did the whole thing myself.
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
Bud ...
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
Yes.
... Yeah.
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
I'm so glad you're here.
But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
Oh.
Bud?
Cool.
So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
Yeah.
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
Hey.
Well it's just not true. We wouldn't be looking at you -- why are you wearing this suit? Did you say hello to your brother in law's?
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
So you can't talk to me?
Yeah but what are you doing?
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
What's the listing?
What city?
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
That's it.
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
This is "Fly With Us?"
And what was this?
You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
....this is your mistake....
Are you telling me no?
It was cool last night.
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
No you won't.
Why did you tell me you did, then?
You lied to me?
-- you said you did.
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
I need help.
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
We got disconnected before....
I was wondering if it's better to ask your girlfriend for the money? It could be really easy. I mean, I have all your information, credit card information and billing stuff --
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
So you think you can?
I thought you had your own business. You said you were gonna diversify and all that stuff....
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
Really? Please?
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
You don't even know how much it is.
Yeah.
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
Can I ask you a question?
You're going to work now?
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
Georgia.
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
...yeah....well you have me now.
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
Where is she?
You have a girlfriend?
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
Are your pants off?
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
Yeah....? So...Jack...are you stroking that big fat fucking cock of yours?
Do you like porno movies?
Are you watching a porno movie?
I'm in my bedroom.
I'm just laying on my bed.
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
This is Georgia.
Hi, is this Jack?
Ok, bye, bye.
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
I'm fine, I have your work number.
For what?
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
That's that.
You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
You just told me to fuck off. That wasn't good. You're dead.
I'll say whatever I want --
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
Now are you threatening me, dick?
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
I said calm down and shut the fuck up. What's your problem?
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
Who is this?
How many sisters do you have?
I didn't know you had a sister?
I think you have a call?
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
Like a psychiatrist?
Yeah.
It's alright.
Mhm.
What's up?
Maybe you said that because you're hungry.....
Yeah.
How's business?
How you doin' Barry?
Ok. You're connected.
Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.
Can you hang on a second?
...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?
This is Janice the operator, who's this?
It takes time to process --
I'm sorry.
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
This is a bunch of bullshit.
Well....what do you want, then?
Are you serious with this?
What is this, man?
That's it.
This is this place called Ace Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't know exactly where this is and I don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. It's a '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says is fine, but I need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then I'll head down there and check it out.
David, Don't. Just. Seriously. It doesn't make sense if you think about it in a fair deal like sense. Ok? It's business. Seriously. One hundred dollars for two days work is a lot more than your family is making sitting around your house. I'm serious now. Ok. Please. Now. Just stop.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
Your expenses are your own.
I want you to go right away, I think that's best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling.
When can you leave?
Shut up, just put him on the phone, it doesn't matter, just shut up --
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
Put him through.
Nothing.
What did you say?
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
Hello?
You don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --
What's the problem?
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
I'm only paying two of you guys.
So they'll go.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
I don't believe it. The Marquis de Sade? You're actually publishing his novels?
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
Then what's he doing here?
I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
"With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
"One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
At your service, Count.
I'm no longer a man! I awoke to discover I'd turned into a sparrow!
Marquis? Is that you?
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
Mustn't do that, sir.
They've got no right, sending someone to sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won't take orders from a stranger.
No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses.
Yes?
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
But I am history.
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
As for the author... shoot him.
Enough!
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
Quite.
Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
I'll fill every slippery hollow; if you're obliging, then you'll swallow!
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
Was ever a man more risqu? He wants to take me every way!
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rou!
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!
At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
Yes?
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
Come now, darling, give it a read.
If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.
No. But tell him I would.
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
"...your wife."
I'd rather read, thank-you.
Very much.
But it's just begun --
Yeah
Bel Air is restricted.
You know that can't happen.
Yeah
Uh-hub.
Over at RKO?
Randolph!
I want blood
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
He lied to me
Sir, I-
Sir?
Sir?
Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
The drinking.
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.

"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--"  Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
A delicious amalgamation, is it?
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
Huh?
You are talking to him.
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
Uh-huh
That's right
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
I wanna see the picture today
You drink at 10 am, do you?
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
May I help you?
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
Yes
Yes
We already made the same offer to the stockholders.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
That's for me to decide.
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
It came.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
You want to do the life of Jesus?
He's Christ?
Oh, no--
We done?
Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
I know what you want but it can't be done!
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
Orson, you wanna take five?
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
They wanna talk to you.
We're from...
Let's go, Jake, wake up!
Ok, champ.
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
Hey champ!
Make it on his own? Does he know the kind of money involved? I mean the real money. He thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? We're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? A nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? Is he really crazy? Listen, Joey, you understand, you tell him. I don't care how great he is or how colorful. He could beat all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all the Janiros he wants to. He ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us. I'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head!
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
All right, you guys, shake hands.
All right. I don't have to hear any more. I think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don't raise your hands. You don't do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but no more after this. You understand?
What?
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
None of your fuckin' business.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
Where you going at this hour?
Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
It's not done.
Where's your wife, Jake?
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?
You sound bitter.
Does that mean...
You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time?
Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
Three more, I figure.
Yeah. At night.
Nine o'clock.
It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
How's the weight? Ok?
This Janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
Jake, sit down for a minute.
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
Excuse me for living.
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
Get lost.  Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
Goodnight.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
This is the baby sitter.
This is Doyle's house.
Don't worry -- it comes off today.
But his leg!
Name me a better photographer.
Jefferies?
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
Yeah.
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
Jeff --
Something wrong?
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
Hello.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
Jeff -- wives don't nag anymore -- they discuss.
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Like what?
I'll send you some comic books.
Read some good books.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
With that cast on -- you don't.
You did.
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
Wrong day?
This is Wednesday.
For getting rid of that cast.
Congratulations, Jeff.
Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
Tell her to bring it back!
Can you get me that ring back?
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
I don't know what you mean.
Why should I?
Who are you?
Hello.
Goodnight, you idiot.
Who's Thorwald?
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
It is something really important, Jeff?
Not a word.
Not yet, Jeff.
Yes.
Hello.
Two minutes.
Phone number?
Your name?
What's happening?
Give me some dirt.
What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
They always live.
Nobody chickened.
Friend of yours?
What's that?
Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
We got to do something.  Don't we?
I like you, you know?
This is the edge, boy.  This is the end.
Okay.
Glad to meet you.
Buzz Gundersen.
What you say your name was?
Just him.
Know the Millertown bluff?
How 'bout you?  Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.
Somebody find him a knife.
Who's fighting?  This is the test, man.  It's a crazy game.
What?
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
What?
Down in back.
Any other entrance?
Smashed the front door.
How'd he get in?
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?
Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
No.
You still want to go home, Moose?
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
Hang loose.  We got all night.
What time is it?
You clean out of your head?  Come on!
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
No.  We're going to bring him down.
I think I should go home.
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
No--
You see any cops?
You see any cops?
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
What's he going to pull--
Well maybe she better start.
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
Do you hear from him, son?
They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now.
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
Come with me, John.
Yes, sir.
John Crawford?
You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
Where did you get the gun?
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
Can you tell me why you killed the puppies, Plato?
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
Why don't you come back tomorrow, son?  Ever been booked before?
Come back tomorrow.
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
What's the charge?
Look--can't you see I'm writing?
Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
What?
Hi.
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
No.  Why?
We were romantic then too--
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.
We sell children's toys --
Toys for... adults?
You can't find... what?
Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
And where they hide the real money.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
I can't go back to Vegas...
He's not Nick Mason...
...so where is he?
I don't steal any --
What... Powwow...
I don't know... what you're...
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
Mr. Bangs.
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
Because down there this is money. Up here this is heat.  You wanted Vegas quality, I brought it to you. You wanted Vegas press, I gave it to you. But guys, please, guys... I can't get you Vegas profits... till one of ya does some spirit dance and does something about this snow.
We're aware of your position.
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?
Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season...
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
What about the Powwow Safe?
The Powwow Safe?
Somebody better give me something with some goddamn bacon --
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.
That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?
Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
That motherfucker --
Acid-chewer.
Cancer-sucker.
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
No, the place. The remodeling. moving everything around.
My what?!
How long ago was your makeover?
Five years. Since it opened.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
Fuckin' freezing.
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
You knew there were guns in here!
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
Where the hell's Gabriel?
What about the money?
How do we do that?
How do we take them out?
What the hell was that about --
Having romance problems, Romeo?
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
You want that for here or to go?
Hi, Nick.
THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN! THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
Monsters in the gelatin...
There is no other table --
I'm ninety-two years old --
What? No...
But... I had a five...
Well...sorry...
I... sorry, Mister...
Without having them hit the alarms.
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
That's what it looks like!
Start talkin
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, I've heard it all before. There's nothing you can do. Except pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get.
Yes.
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
Now where were we?
Alone at last.
I don't wanna lift crates.
I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole I got an honest-to-goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own. I can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin' back before ten o'clock curfew.
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
Seymour Scagnetti.
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
You fuckin' wish.
No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
Fine, now.
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?
Well, what I wanna do is go back to work. But I got this Scagnetti prick deep up my ass. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again.
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
Sure.
It's a change.
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now. But when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It hurts like the first time. The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, "Like a Virgin."
Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.
Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
I do.  How do I look?
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
Your name's Freddy something.
I know.
I don't like alarms.
I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.
You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
You didn't ask.
Nice Guy Eddie.
It's a surprise.
Down to my car.
I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
What're you talkin' about?
What's this guy's problem?
So, talk.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
You don't believe in tipping?
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
C'mon, throw in a buck.
When I was coming down here, I was playin' it. And "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million-trillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy.
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her --  And him. Shootin' going on, we'll never find Lednov.
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
Nobody. The light was bad.
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
Why didn't you say so. Go right out and get her. Ed. build the fire up.
It doesn't matter who they are.
Tell them to come on in.
You don't know how good it is to see you.
Hello, Miss Wells.
She's a friend -- took off this morning sort of sudden while I wasn't around.
I found their surrey --
A fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden, he don't take chances. My name's Clayton and I'm looking for someone.
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
Which ranch?
I -- lost something.
What's there to be fair about?
Nobody asked you to.
All right, you didn't know.
What's there to be fair about?
Nobody asked you to.
All right, you didn't know.
Yeah, how did you know?
You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
I'm sorry. Let's go.
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
I said I didn't care.
I don't care.
If she says anything to them I'll kill her.
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
Go away -- please.
Stop it -- stop it.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
But I want to stay.
It isn't that --
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
I figure we'll get along just fine.
Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
That sure smells good.
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
Just a thing I was workin' on.
No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
You got no business snoopin' around --
They went on like I told you.
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
Go ahead.
Suppose I take a look.
Yeah.
And you're all alone.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
There aren't any women here.
Even women?
Yes, people make me restless.
What's the matter -- restless?
Well, say it.
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
I don't like to see you go.
I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
They shouldn't have done that.
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
Depends on how good you drive.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
How far up the trail?
Where is he?
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
Who brought you here?
How do you know who we are?
Yeah, we sure have.
We got company. Female company.
I said I had a guy to see and I'm going to see him.
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
I said let's go.
He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
Because there's a man I want to see.
What for?
We got to get movin'.
Lookin' around.
What are you doin' --
Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
Put on another one.
He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
Why, yes. They're all I need...
Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body.
No, I won't let you do it.
Ha! Right bitch!
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
Wife?!
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
That's it.
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Me, too. 101?
Well, actually, we've never met officially, but I bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. I said, "I'm sorry," and you said, "Watch it, white bitch, or I'll put my size eight in your ass." I thought how cool. I wear a size eight, too. Anyway, this is my best friend, Cindy.
Do I know you?
Hey, Brenda.
Would you die already?!
My favorite memory was when we --
Never happened!
Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
Cindy, what's going on?
Okay.
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
What?! What is it, a monster?!
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
No, you don't understand. It's here in these statues...
Ouch!!
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
Okay.
Ray, run faster.
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
Where's Shorty?
He's so brave.
He's right. I should go first.
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
You sure?
No, stay.
So, I guess I can go now.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
Shhh... It's okay.
Hello Ray.
Hello Brenda.
That means more screen time for us.
Let her go, Cin.
So, whatever happened to her?
Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.
No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
Come on. We better get you cleaned up.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I broke my fall.
I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
It's the sequel.
It's okay.
Yes!!!!
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
Made you say it!
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
Um, I'm not touching anything.
Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
Thanks. I made them by hand.
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
Soon, but first I must bless this house.
I'm sorry.
My child you are the only survivor.
We? What do you mean... we?
My child, you're alive!
She's right. We should stick together.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
Of course. So sexy.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
What are you working on?
Hello Dwight.
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
I'm the caretaker, not the handyman.  Nice skates. Be careful. You don't want to fall and break something.
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
You mean to tell me we're dead!
You're not wearing a belt.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
My help?
You never could feel your legs.
Second best.
Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
How is she?
It's okay. I understand.
I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
I'm so glad you're here.
Father, come in, please.
Uh... I'm Father McFeely
No, I'm fine.
Father, I think you should rest.
My holy water.
No thanks.
What she said about your mother?
What?
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
No, because her breath smells like a horse's ass.
Because she will lie?
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
Then let us prepare.
Yes.
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
Father, are you okay?
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
Would you like to see the girl?
Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
Father.
This part removes the sense of humor.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
Yo son, check this out.
Now you're being rude, Shorty.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
Don't worry, I got your back.
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
"Fucked me."
"Ray!"
"Fucked me."
"Ray!"
Aww. Cool. Dude.
"Fucked me."
Get out?! What does it say?
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
It says, "Ray."
What does it say?
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
I woke up naked, too.
No more violence... No more violence...
Bring her home... I guess.
No!  It wasn't like gore movies at all!  IT WAS REAL!
Is MOM... in there?
I saw blood! And it's brown! Not red like in horror movies, but brown!!
That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!
...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!
She wouldn't...
You don't think...
0h, shit!
Mother?
Mrs. Sutphin?
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??...
What a bitch!
This is so cool! It's just like a horror movie.
What happened?
Did you hear?
Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
Oh, boy!
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
Hi, Mom.
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
BLOOD FEAST!
If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
MURDERED?!!
I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
Well... he was an asshole... but he didn't deserve to die!
You said you hated him.
I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
Jeeezzz!
Hi!
He's really cute!
Here we go again.
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Carl's a jerk!
Is there a killer loose?
Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
Always the dentist.
Keep the change, you son of a psycho!
You see the sign! It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!
I don't feel like rewinding it!
Because it's the rules!
Why?
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Sorry, ma'am.
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
In here, Mom...
Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
You scared me.
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
I'm so happy I could shit.
Looks good, Mom!
Oh Mom...
But Mom, the video's not over.
Let me see!
Thanks, Mom.
She sure can pick 'em!
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
You mean for TV or print?
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
That's right.
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
Your mom killed my brother!
Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
Are you Chip Sutphin?
Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
Hi, Hank.
I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
She's gonna kill Scotty!
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
You've been working in that video shop too long.
He goes to college with me!
GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
"P" as in...
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
Objection! Argumentative!
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles!  I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  The prosecution rests, your honor.
Ooohhhhhh! I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life!
What do you mean, you're not sure?!
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
Yes, I was.
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
Marvin A. Pickles.
State your name, please.
But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
Watch the booth! I'll be back!
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
It's him!
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
He killed people, Mom.
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
It's sugarless.
I do, please.
No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
Yes... but... I didn't...
Yes, but I lent it...
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
...Browsing.
Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
That's like your car, Beverly,
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
It's the least I could do.  I heard shouting.
Beverly, are you alright?
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
There is one big problem though.
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
Mrs... Sutphin?
Now, here's a babe!
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
Are we leaving?
Man, that one made me puke!
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
What is it, Betty?
How to send a bill!!
What's he know?
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
What was that?
Nice one, huh? Winter's coming.  Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...
I'll take this instead.
Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods!
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
I'll give you fifty cents.
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
You know who I am, August?
You won't get any water and you won't get any rest. You may as well drink.
No.
Drink.
May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
When I wanted to.
No.
Then, you also understand that you must die.
Yes, I understand.
The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?
No. It's my father -- I wanted to talk to you -- you wrote about cures --
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
Yes.
Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
Thank you.
Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
Oh, as beautiful as ever.
For the time being, I imagine that must do.
How much have you got?
She can only use cash.
She could use a hundred dollars.
Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her.
As a man, you distrust me - perhaps you believe me as a physician.
You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
I've come from Jacqueline. She needs money.
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
You	fool! That symbol is us -- us. She was asking about us.
What did she want to know?
And that was all?
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
What were you talking about?
What did she want?
You will die.
I don't know.
And then?
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
Why wait?
I'm tired of being afraid - of waiting.
I'm afraid.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
No!
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
Who are you?
Yes.
I won't get lonely.
Good-bye.
You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
But you should make her laugh, Jason. Come, make jokes for her. I'll bring your food to their table.
Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one  so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her - he doesn't make her laugh  he just sits and talks.
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
Jason, my pet 
Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
Well, since, you're over twenty one
Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission.
No, not at all, Mr. Jason.
It's here, too.
And the other was Judd?
Who was the first one -- Mrs. Redi?
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
I had to help get rid of the body. You saw it on the subway. And I warn you, Mary -- go back -- you don't know what you're doing, or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister. You go back to school - - go back and forget Jacqueline.
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
It will make you unhappy to find Jacqueline. It would put her in danger --- great danger --
If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
That's too bad.
Thank you, my dear.
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
Yes  and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline.
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
I'm afraid not.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
She's not been here for a long time.
Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna -
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
That makes it all the more difficult 
Have you any other relatives, Mary?
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
Yes?
When?
What?
Why
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
Then it is decided. Leo and Durk and I will make our plans.
I have taken care of Mary. I've spoken to her. She's going back to school.
What about Judd -- he knows about us.
It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.
I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
But he also wrote --
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
I should have known. She had no sincerity - no real belief.
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.
There's a phone here.
No, I touched me.
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
Not for three-fifty.
Plus first and last month deposit.
Student?
Plenty of room for two people.
Mr. Kirkland has asked me to inform you that he has obtained legal representation elsewhere, and that if you have a message for him to leave it with me.
Mr. Millaney?
One moment.
May I ask who's calling?
IBM.
He said immediately.
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
Mr. Millaney?
Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me.
Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.
Was he nice to you?
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Hi. Want a drink?
Hi.
So? You'll find out what's wrong and then you'll be able to relax a little bit. Let him be the uptight one for a change.
He'll be really mad.
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
Jesus!
With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
I see. Then what brought you up here?
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
You knew these people?
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
You're the one who found the bodies?
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Well, let's go talk to your doctor.
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
Medical clinic?
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
Is that the man who called you up here?
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
But where are you going?
Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
Well? Supper at my place?
Anything wrong?
Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm.
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
No. Dotty's the last.
Another kiss?
Kiss, kiss?
Do I get a kiss?
OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start.
Nick, you're so strange...
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
You say something?
I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
What do you want to call me at the office for?
Can I call you at the office?
Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I think she must go to look for you.
Yes? Who is there?
We live in 703.
I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.
Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
Gonna cut me open?
That's the one.
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
Didn't seem worried about them.
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Good shape for an old man, eh?
Want me to breathe deeply?
WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME

Nothing.  Just...memories!
What?
They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn.
I tell you what's cooking.  She made the blind see and it was a gift!  Who was it from?  Let's hear an 'F" for...
What's cookin', Bert?
Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you!
Time to check with Flavors.
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
Fools!
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
A wreck.
How's Brad?
Of course.
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
You bet, Bert.
I got it!  I got it!!!
You got it!
Infantile regression.
Congratulations!  It's 'Happy Homes' for Harry and Emily Weiss of Denton.
I got it!  I got it!!!
You got it!
As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.
About Brad's family?
LITTLE BLACK DRESS
SIN-I-FUL
WELL FIRST YOU GO RIP RIP RIP THEN YOU GO SNIP SNIP SNIP THEN YOU WHIP IN A ZIP ZIP ZIP AN' YOU SPLIT IT UP TO THE HIP HIP HIP AN' AS YOU STRIP STRIP STRIP YOU QUIVER AND SHIVER FOR THAT SOFT CARESS AS YOU SLIP SLIP SLIP...INTO THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS
But...how?
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
When do I get to see Brad?
Home?
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
Right!  An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep.
On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
Of course!  D.T.V.'s most popular Hospital series featuring those perennial favorites, Cosmo and Nation McKinley. Neuro-specialists par excellence ...if you'll pardon my French. I recommend you send Brad to them for treatment!
I've caught it once or twice.
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
I know, I know, it's just...
He needs help.
We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.
I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
Introduce yourselves.
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
So it seems.
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
Why Janet?
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
How did you come by this scenario?
Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
Out of self comes selflessness.
Who trusts experts?
We're the experts.
Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
SOLD??!!
Dentonvale has been sold.
SPONSOR!!!
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
You too, Betty!
I'll leave you young things to it.
Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.  I just came to give you this.
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE
But I don't need treadment.
What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
I'm not going, Janet.
We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.
I don't want to get up there.
That's us.

Too flashy...they'll clash with the new outfits.
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
I'd forgotten.
He was adopted you know.
Mental instability?
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
And how does *'local girl'* Janet Majors fit into the scheme of things?
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
Could you tell us a little about it?
Absolutely correct.
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
Sure thing.
Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
Brad!  Oh, Brad.
Who?
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
What do you mean?
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
That doesn't make sense.
But they only think they're happy.
Of course.
Could I do that later?
I can't wear anything under it. That would spoil the line.
You're practically naked!
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
Your father doesn't like Mexicans.
Why?
You shouldn't have said that.
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
Poor Brad.
What show?
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
It's...
They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show.  The Far East meets the Mid-West!
I know.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
Oh my poor baby.
Don't worry, Janet.  Brad'll probably get just what he needs.
Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
I'm sorry, Officer.
Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed?

BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
I never signed the contract.  He's not going anywhere.
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
BRAD!
I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
Brad!
Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
. . .For his own good.
EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
Do you really think so?
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  Look at yourself.
I want to see Brad.
It's classical.  Almost a textbook case...
Me?
Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
I'm...happy.
No...couldn't I do this later?
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
No!  He's never done that before.

And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
That's an extremely negative response.
Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?
It's you we're concerned about, Janet.
What does he know about it?
Our field.
I don't think he intends to go that far.
HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
Our speciality.
We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
THIS COULD TAKE US TO A TOWN THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
Surely.
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
We all love Janet...Who do we love?
We love you, Baby.
She walks in beauty...
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
Isn't she lovely?
We're not confused.
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
No.
And none of them worked?
Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
The fuck was that?
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
Bye.
Bye.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
Why are you being so defensive?
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?
Good. That's good.
You guys having fun?
It'll just take a second.
You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
Are you there? Miles?
I'm sorry, Miles.  So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
How's the trip?
Miles.
You okay, Miles?
Maya? Haven't seen her. I think she's off tonight. Say, where's your buddy?
You got it.
Glass or bottle?
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
How's it hanging, Miles?
What do you think?
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
My condolences.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
I just remember you jogging. So when's the wedding?
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
They're just leftovers.
Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
What happened to you guys?
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
Not so bad yourself.
Good. How're you?
I know. I might need to be spanked.
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
Oh yeah.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Stephanie.
That's what people say.
Hey, guys. How's it going?
Then buy a bottle and go outside.
Sir, what are you doing?
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
Both.
About a year.
About four weeks.
You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
See you, Miles. You take care.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Oops. Sorry.
Huh.
So what are you up to today, Miles?
Where's Jack?
Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her.
That was fun last night.
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
So what do you think?
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
Daddy.
No dad!
Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.
A hair.
There's dust in it.
She doesn't answer me either.
Does she ever answer back?
Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
Only for pee or poop.
It tastes old.
I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?
Houdini's sick.
Me too.
I don't want you to die.
The same windows.
My ballet recital.
I heard them Morgan.
It tastes funny.
I think it's contaminated.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
Tell him... See. Tell him to see.
...Tell Graham --
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
I don't feel much.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
Hi sweetie.
Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?
You got two minor league home run records don't you?
It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
What do you mean, the horses?
No money, eh?
You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die.
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
It was my fault.
Your next water ain't for three days.
I think we lost 'em.
Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.
The one with the shotgun.
Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me.  So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back.
Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy didn't like it and we had some words, so I decided to get out of there.
All I did was kiss a girl.
You got me. This is a crazy town, Emmett. I think we ought to get out of here.
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
Forget it.
All right then.  Let's go.
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
I didn't know you were out.
Emmett.
Right.
She was hurt... pretty bad.  Emmett, they took the little boy with them.
McKendrick's men got him.
I almost didn't.
So far that's all I seen in this life.
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
You'll never make it.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
Sure.
Yeah... maybe. So long.
Chicago. Working in the slaughter- houses.
After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
Just like you'd think. But he's not going to run. We're sticking to our plan. Now we both need help.
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
It's one thing to know it...
This is a brutal land.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
Didn't Paden tell you that?
You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again.
Goodbye?
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
I guess I put a good scare into him.
They've been kind to me.
Some. I've been talking to the Parkers. One thing I know I'm not doing -- I'm not going back.
More than enough.
And they were two of them. Look --
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
And you're not Baxter, either?
You're not Baxter?
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
Ten A.M.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
That's a lie.
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
What about the law?
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
You own this land.
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
Who?
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
What happened?
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
Where is Rae?
I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. But I never thought it'd be my boy. I never thought that.
Daddy?
I want to build something, make things grow. That takes hard work -- a lifetime of it. That's not why men come to a pretty woman.
Because they don't like what I want.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together.  Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
Why, J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
New record.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
All I did was kiss the girl.
Who is he?
This a friend of yours?
He'll be here.
We wait.
That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.
Blind Pete taught me a great trick.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
Right!
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
Really?
You can't do this.
I'm done talking. Get out.
What are you talking about?
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
You wanted to see me?
Give the man a line of credit. He already owes the house thirteen bucks.
Howdy.
Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
I decide what's right in this jurisdiction. Now move.
That ain't right.
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
Don't press your luck, Carter.
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
Is that a fact?
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
What's all this then?
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
The jury saw it differently.
But the good citizens of Turley have taken me in their embrace, and for one simple reason. I maintain the peace. So when strangers come to town, I always ask them their business. Have you come for the hanging?
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
Now let's talk about you chaps.
Shut up. You need help, don't you?
Why him?
Because I'm your sister.
Why would they stop you?
What makes you think I could?
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
What's stopping you?
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
Why come to me?
Rae, I need help.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
I don't have any family any more.
Rae, all we got is each other.
It's none of your business.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
Who did it?
He was murdered.
Daddy's dead.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
Hello, Rae.
Yeah, it's working out real good.
I got there just short of too late.
You don't know?
Because they enjoy it.
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
Did you hear his son is still around?
I heard that too.
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
We'll handle that. He's careless.
What about his brother?
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
He must be pretty good.
Good-bye, Paden.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend.  But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
I never could count on you to be reasonable.  Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
I thought we talked about that.
I'm going to have to look into this.
So we understand each other?
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
You know, Paden, what makes all this work is me doing my job. The fellows you came to town with are causing some trouble. It's going to take a little straightening out. I have my responsibilities. I want you to understand. It has nothing to do with us.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
Maybe you could run it without Stella.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
I took out thirteen dollars.
Nothing like that will happen between us.
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
What brings you into my saloon?
Stella, we still got an extra room out back, don't we?
You got a place to stay?
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
Where's the dog?
I see you're prospering without me.
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.
I thought you two would get along.
It's an advance. We want him to know he's going to be happy here.
Oh, yeah, you two are going to get along fine. You got a lot in common.
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the "man" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself?
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
Good-bye.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
I'm not --  He's not.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor now.
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
Hello, is this Elaine?
Listen to what you're saying, mom. Is there any evidence she is?
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence.  Have you?
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
So you did meet her?
Because obviously she existed, right?
Just a minute.
It was a great show, Dad...
Mom, do you miss Dad?
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
Why?
You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
Is that a problem?
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Yes, call me Simone.
Do what you do to Simone.
I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
... so much like her?
Of course.
No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
And what may I ask brought this on?
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
-- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
I suppose the thing I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
How about the nudity?
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
No, I'm okay.
That's a good question.  As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."
Who are you really?
Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real.  Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
I'm not even sure I deserve it. After tonight I'll have almost as much screen time on your show as I do in my movies.  How is that healthy for a performer?
You don't secretly want the attention?
Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
Of course, the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more.
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
Simone!
I have to talk to her about my experimental film.  It's very... experimental.
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
Somebody said she was here.
Is she here?
How did the wall get there?
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
Why not?
But she's right there!  I must feel her!
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
For her?
How will you do our love scenes?
It was more in passing.
I'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now.  She is just as you described her, Viktor... indescribable.  I strongly sensed she thought I was right for it.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
"Straw God" changed my life.
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
-- Flesh is weak.
-- We call them "vactors".
Not like this --
You have to see her.
Don't be.  It was worth it.
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
I have your new leading lady...  ... right here in my pants.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy.  We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it.
About you and mom?
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
I know.  Thank her for me.
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
Why didn't she thank you?
I love you too, daddy.
I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
I noticed.
I do okay.  How about you?
Good-night, Daddy.
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
No, not that.  I was just wondering -- in the bedroom scene in reel two why did Simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror?
One thing bothered me.
I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
-- I know, I don't know anything.
Okay, Dad.
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
I read.
I do.
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
I know plenty of boys.
Why?
Only her brilliance.  To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck.  You really pulled it off.
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
Is she here tonight?
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
This week anyhow.
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
Hi, Dad.
I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
Hi, Dad.
What?!
An insanity defence.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
Don't you?
No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
She hasn't uttered a word that whole time -- until she saw the big show.
I traced her to a nursing home.  A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
Er,... good.
I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it?  What is it -- drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? All three?  What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
She was never in New Mexico.  She never left the studio.
It's bogus.  You used an old library shot for the background.
I think you do.  I know it's a fake.
I know what you're up to.
Nice boat, Taransky.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
This is the story.
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
I don't understand.
It's a hotel.
Is that why she left you?
-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
We used to.
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
What do you want -- ?
Mr. Sayer...
Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.  As for a photo -- if you can't do it, I know twelve million people who can.
Long live the First Amendment.
Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
I will when you're finished writing it.
My God, you've got one?
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
24-hour tail on Taransky?
We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Yes, very.
Dark?
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Why?
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Is it a jamming device?
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
But that's Simone's part.
Thank you.
Would you like me to read?
After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look.  She really inspired me.
I never apologized properly for what happened on "Sunrise".
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
It wasn't working anyhow.  The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film.  I don't think anyone will understand it.  I already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences".
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
Taller, Viktor.
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
You're in breach.
What if it catches on fire?
Is Miss Simone coming today?
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
-- What you don't understand --
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
Hi.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
You know what I'm talking about.
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
You did create me.
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started.
I am the death of real.
Maybe he can.
You mean they buy it?
... digitized.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Goodnight, Malcolm.
Tell me.
Why did you leave me?
Why, Malcolm?
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
--My God.
Wow. They called you their son.
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Thanks.
Don't step in the horse manure.
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.
Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
I trust you... Besides, I don't know if I'm up for the Amish today. You can't curse or spit or anything around them.
On my way to the flea market in Amish country. Thought maybe you want to come. Show me how to buy at these things.
--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
S-ssssstop it!
S-ssstop that!
Who!
How did you--?
What--
Excuse me?
I don't know how else to look--
Like what?
Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
Yes, Cole?
Good for you.
J. C. Penny's?
Chuck E. who?
It's our pleasure.
...Chicken blood? Who said it was... "chicken blood"?
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
'Course, it's none of my business.
Maybe you don't want to remember.
Hell, he was your grandfather. You know what he did.
'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
See?
Nope.
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
Two.. maybe three days.
What's a "little while?"
Could take a little while, though.
Alright!
Just talked to Orwell down at the garage. Says getting a new alternator for your bus is no problem.
You're standing in horseshit.
Oh yeah? Why's that?
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.
Suzie???
Aha. The Lovers.
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
...Hi.
I happen to be a professional.
Rod... I have to get back to my job.
Not according to these.
Bitch.
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Witch.
Bitch.
Fuck you.
Get off his case sweetie.
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
Not someone -- Mac.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
Sorry.
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
I didn't do anything --
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
Book of Jeremiah.
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
I thought you said two hundred.
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
-- "Billy-Jean" --
"Peggy-Sue" --
Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
Died in the bathtub... if, in fact, he's really dead. Next.
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
Hey. Fuck you.
I could. You sucked.
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!
We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
Come out, come out wherever you are!
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
He's right. Nice guitar break.
Yeah, man. You were wrong, Suze. My solo definitely works better in the second verse.
Old Macdonald had some... MOONSHINE!
Harvest moonshining!
He means moon shining.
Hi Suze.
"And a slash-slash there --"
"With a hack-hack here --"
"-- an AXE!"
"Old Macdonald... had --"
Metaphysical question, man.
Should we be doing this, dude?
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
So... what does it do?
Manure... is life.
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
Are you crazy?
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
Let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
You're out of your mind, man.
Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
Well, there goes our record deal.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Curt Cobain.
Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
Nothing. I'll have us back on the road in no time.
What's wrong?
Ow!
-- By way of my breasts?
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
You don't like my costume? Cool. I'll go with plan B. Which one you like better?
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
Never heard of it.
Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
Not while you're driving.
Throw me one.
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
He started it.
Not at all. They lynched my ancestors, they smell like manure, they have sex with their relatives... and they all have two first names: "Bobby- Joe" --
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
Who you callin' "boy?"
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
Who? Us?!
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Fuck you! Who cares what sandwich the bitch was eating?
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Chicken sandwich?
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
Yeah. That's just the problem.
Yeah. That sounds good. "Hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig".
Yes!
Shit!
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
Someone better tell Mac.
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Where's Mac?
Us? We been... moonlighting.
Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
Like what?
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
What is it?!!
Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.
I was getting 'warmed' up.
I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
How are you going to find him?
Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
Bill, we need to talk!
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
Bill, you're Chief of police now.
What the hell are we going to do?!
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
He's a fucking Martian?!
We're coming your way, man!
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
What's she see in that douchebag?
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
Looks like a chipmunk.
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
What?
Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
Don't worry, Chief.
Hey there, Chief.
I got to leave my post.
Sorry.
Yeah.
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
You dig that rat out of the hole?
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
What?
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
Shut up.
Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Hell, I was game!
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
Megan Halesy' little sister.
All the rib eyes?
How many you need?
What can I do you for?
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
When one sees you they all see you.
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
Margaret.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
Praise Jesus.
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
Where'd he go?
Hey, look!
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
Gold--digger, huh?
Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
Get your hands off my daughter!
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
You.
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
You got my barley pop?
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
But it wasn't a Kenworth.
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
What's he get if he wins here?
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
You sure do.
I'll do it.
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
Yes.
I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?
Why should I?
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
Order up!
No what?
What's your pleasure?
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Breaker. Breaker.
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
Breaker. Breaker.
Have any trouble getting here?
He's thirsty.
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
I think you're just yellow.
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
That crazy sumbitch made it.
Chickenshit money.
Five thou.
Yes, sir.
Now, you just find him, son.
Oh.
That's the point, Dickey.
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.
Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
Then it must be a helluva idea.
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
Is that Bandit in the lead?
-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
-- Okey, doke. Last one to the Roadeo is a homo.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
And who has access to that floor?
Of course. Yes.
Is your security team armed?
No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
So there are no guests staying on that floor?
Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --
You have a butler working that floor?
Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
What kind of personnel?
Yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.
-- so you shut them off?
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
That's correct.
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
Yeah.
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
Uh, yeah.
The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
You were here huntin' a man named Israel, weren't you? Your name is Tremor.
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
Two of 'em?
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
But there were more of you?
Mmm-hmm.
And this is your car, isn't it?
Pretty much, yep.
And threw us into the lake.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
You shot me and murdered my friends.
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
Three men were ambushed and shot, two died and had their bodies tossed into the lake, the other has severe hypothermia, possible dementia and will probably be a multiple amputee by week's end... if he even lives that long.
Ww... uh...
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
You think so?
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
Man, that's great.
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
Really?
I don't mind now anyway. You know, up here in Heaven, it's beautiful. Way better than fuckin' Hawaii or any place like that.
Damn... alright then.
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
You woulda?
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
...I forgive you Darwin.
I'm here, where's the car?
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
Buddy, I'm not an ethics professor, I'm a physician, be honest, or be dead within a day... s'your choice.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
I've got concerns.
Yeah, why.
Then what --
Two security levels, the one we're going in under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. They're mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks.  There's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift. If we split up, we can blend in and enter unnoticed. Once we're inside the hotel, we'll regroup.
I been accused of worse.  What do we got...?
Your attitude sucks.
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
Yeah, we've been through that.
That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.
I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.
Shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell after Hitler... I like your chances a lot more.
So I guess you're not going.
Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.
His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
What happened?
FUCK YOU!
Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!
...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
The Deputy Director, this prick Locke, he smashed the whole thing, we're done, they won't tell me why...
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --
Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
What were you doin' here anyway?
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
That takes some of the sting out.
True?
For real?
It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch.  I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
-- never in a million girl --
Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we can get you there. We wait any longer, someone goin' dead this fool.
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... I said good.  'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive.
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit, the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout, tap-dance "show us your shit" thing neither -- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya.
And you're not?  Maybe you're my puppet.  But like all puppets, you think you're actually human.  It's The Puppet's Dream.  Wondering if they're human!
No?  Who am I, then?
You'll end up like me.
What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
It can.  Ordinary matter, like ours? Not affected.  Everything else, disintegrates.
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
Leave the light off.
Yes.
If it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it.
It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
Whose side are you on?
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
No, she won't.
Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters.  She walked into it and disappeared.  She was gone.
Not her.  It.
Why did you agree to come here?
Yes.
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
In the lab.  With her, probably.
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
Didn't you talk to Snow?
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
You want it coming back with us?
Fuck me.  I knew it.
Snow, get up here, now.
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
Followed by non-human manifestations.
A recoil, with no compensating mechanism.
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
Why do you say that?
Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Looks a little constipated to me.
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape.
Claire!
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
You're planning to speak?
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
Claire...
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
Claire...
... just saying you should think twice about it...
Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
I heard.
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.
Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza.
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
Call a cruiser!
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
Wasn't your fault.
Be happy.  He's good at this.
Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
Hey Mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh... How do you like it so far?
Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
Does it make you... hard?
Ever shot anyone?
You're here 'til what time?
I don't really see what that has to do with...
No, I will not step outside.
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
I asked for the man in charge...
Are you in charge here?
What the fuck you doin'?!
Under the table.
Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
I'm not lettin' no one go.
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
Bullshit!  Prove it.
Why should she come in?
How do I know that's her?
Hold it...!
You should'a brought the girl.
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
Peter-- you took this picture?
And Flash isn't?
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
Sexual tension...
Or was it all a dream?
See?
I was there.
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
Flash, drop it--
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
I'm parked illegally!
Lizzy!
Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo.
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
I got you a present.
You get mugged or something?
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
Jesus Christ.
I am not pitiful!  I am the bridge to the bermensch!
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
Screw scholarships!   Universities are death!  They make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  Burn 'em down, I say!
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
They'll never take me alive.
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
How are you doing, kid?
Get away from me, freak!
Lemme down, bugface!
No!  Now get outta my face, kid.
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do.
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know, sexy stuff.
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
Hmf-hrr?
Frmpph-yrr.
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
An even five I throw in the jacket.
You're making my life difficult.
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
What's this? A cockaroach?
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
Are you quite finished?
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
Precise equipment such as waldos
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
Nope.  Maybe he skipped to Rio. Feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  Are you absolutely positive that one at E.S.U. is kaput?
Any sign of our friend?
Yeah, Roz.
Peter-- my condolences.
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
Of course.
I know him.
You sure about all this?
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
Toxic dumps, huh.
There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270.
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
Waldos.
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
Some of him char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out suicide.  Any bad blood between him and Ock?
So you've found Thorkel?
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
Poison emergency.
Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
I will finish what I've begun
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron
No!
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
I don't care.  Cretin.
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--
Let's talk in the hall.
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
You have no right!  This is cosmic suicide!
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
No. It isn't.
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
Creation? Or its opposite?
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
My self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
A bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
I left a paper in my desk.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
If you really apply yourself, you'll get an A next time.
The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
Only Octavius knows for sure.  And last time I spoke to him, he was on the planet Whiz-Bang.
How much do you know about it?
Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness, my boy, and lots of it.
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Your dog ate it.
Peter, what can I do for you?
Mr. Parker.
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
Okay, kid. Call me tomorrow.
I asked if you felt like a drink--
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
Nah.  The big mask was better.
Where'd you get the clown suit?
No, no!  Not there!
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
Do you... live around here?
Loonytunes.  And yet...
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
He'll try to finish his experiment.
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
You're sure you're all right.
Right.  Let's go.
I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
We did not.
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
What's wrong with him?
They never caught on.
Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!
Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
Jawohl!
Is you all little Adolfs?
Jawohl.
Is you all good Nazis?
Jawohl.
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
Any news on Dunbar?
I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
Coming up.
Roger.
Static!
Looks good outside.
So long, Sefton.
If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
Who is it?
Who is it?
In this barracks?
I don't know anymore.
There's only one pair left.
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
You are talking crazy!
Which one of you is what?
Tipping me off? I do not understand.
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Let's!
What are the chances busting out of here?
It's on me.
Yeah.
Not you.
Sefton!
My legs are frozen.
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
Twenty-five.
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
You will remember the name? Von Scherbach? VON SCHER-BACH!
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
You are being rude again.
Of course you did! Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running around in circles. The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people. And von Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
Abfuehren!
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
I'm okay here. Why bother?
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
I'll live.
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
105-353.
What is your number?
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
How long is temporarily? I trust not until July.
The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
Isn't it?
Interesting.
Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
You were saying --?
I am not. According to the Geneva Convention --
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
What exactly is he charged with?
It is.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
And this?
What is this? This is water?
Raus! Raus! All of you!
Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
Some are not bad at all.
Ja -- ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the jokes! Droppen Sie dead!
Jawohl.
Jawohl?
Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
You have a Lieutenant here...
Good evening, Sergeants.  A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?
Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
Anything else?
Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
Los, los. Dummkopf!
Give this to Joey, will you?
Shapiro. Shapiro.
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
At ease! He also says, quote: All you sack rats better show up for the services and no bull from anybody. Unquote. At ease! Monday afternoon a sailboat race will be held at the cesspool. See Oscar Rudolph of Barrack 7 if you want to enter a yacht. Next: Jack Cushingham and Larry Blake will play Frank deNotta and Mike Cohen for the pinochle championship of the camp.
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
Give me the radio.
You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
Ja, ja, gewiss! It is only that we are cramped for space with new prisoners every day.  Gentlemen! Outside! Please! Do you want me to have trouble with the Kommandant again!
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Talk what? I do not know anything!
No! No!
I do not want those cigarettes.
What guy?
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
Fine -- fine!
Good morning, Sefton.
Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket.
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
It is not me. It is the orders. I am your friend. I am your best friend here.
All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
That is my wife.
This is me in Cincinnati.
Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
Russian women prisoners?
Full disruptors.
Target their Bridge.
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
Where is he now?
Then when is he going to Engineering?
He is.
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
Where is he?
It's working.
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
HoS qorDu.
Toh-pak-cha=8A
Yes, well, congratulations, Ensign. It wouldn't be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm.
Twelve years, sir.
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
Captain=8A
Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
Thanks for pointing that out.
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
All hands, brace for impact!
Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
The station complement was nineteen.
There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
Beam them directly to Sickbay.
We're within range, sir.
On screen.
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
Signal the closest starship. We're in no condition to mount a rescue. We don't even have a full crew aboard.
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
Can you locate them?
Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
It won't be installed until Tuesday.  Ensign Sulu, try generating a subspace field around the ships. That might break them free.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
We don't have a tractor beam.
Please, I insist.
No, no. Thank you.
Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.  Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.
Oh, of course.
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
Please, please.
Well, may we have a look around?
It's our pleasure.
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say I was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that.
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?
Close to retirement?
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.
No, no, it's not. It's better.
I don't need to be lectured by you. I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers. And frankly, I think the galaxy owes me one  I was like you once- so worried about duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the end, what did it get me? Nothing. Not this time.
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
Temporal nexus, yeah, I heard you.  Something's missing.
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
Kirk here.
I always do.
Keep her together until I get back.
Where are the deflector relays?
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
Aye.
A photon torpedo?
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
I thought you might.
But I do have a theory...
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
Phasing? To where?
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
And what would that be, sir?
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
Oh
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
That's a pretty big margin of error.
Maybe they're not out there.
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
No, sir.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
Sir?
Bad food, brutal discipline.  No women.
Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander.
When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
There's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life, your own career.
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
You can't fool an empath, Captain. I know exactly when I'm needed.
I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's counselor, it's my duty to-
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
Captain, are you all right?
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan.  Good luck.
You must think I'm quite the madman.
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode.
Aye, sir.
Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
Lock phasers and return fire!
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
Aye, sir.
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
Trilithium?
One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
There are no other ships in the system.
It looks like we're too late.
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
The royal...studs?
Execute!
Transwarp at your command, Sir!
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
Tractor beam, aye!
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Incredible machine. Helmsman, one-quarter impulse power.
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
Status!
Soon, Captain... Quite soon.
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
Sure - whatever games you wanna play.
Put me on the hailing frequency.
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
On screen.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
Locate.
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
Aye sir, coding now.
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
What is it?
In code to STARFLEET... Captain's Spock's tube located intact on Genesis surface. Will relay more data on subsequent orbits.
Could it be Spock's?
We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
"... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger." I know the book, Saavik.
You said there wouldn't be any.
Just him, sir!
They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
Aye, sir!
Aye, sir!
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
Sir...?
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
The ship... Out of danger...?
Why would you do this...?
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
I know you... Do I not?
Oh, I'll have "Mr. Adventure" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous.  All my hopes.
Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.
Gentlemen. Good evening.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
Would you look at that?
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
No, sir, no response.
Any time.
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Yours...?!
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Ah, too bad... Well... You have all done remarkable service under the most -- difficult of conditions. You'll be receiving Starfleet's highest commendations, and more importantly, extended shore leaves.
Where's Doctor McCoy?
Welcome home, Jim.

Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
Genesis, I want it.
Because you wish it.
No.
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!

Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
Who I am is not important. That I have them is.  I will let you speak to them.
Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.

Report status!
<U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks!
They outnumber us, my Lord --
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
How can you tell that?
They know we would die first.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
I ordered no interruptions.
I only meant, my lord, that if it's prisoners you want --  There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek.
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
Sir, may I suggest --
Station!
Success, my lord.
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
Understood, my lord.
Share this with no one.
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
So!  Speak!
Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
Sir, may I --
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
My Lord... what are your orders?
Put him on screen!  Study him well.
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.

500 Kellicams!
Wait!... Wait...
1,000 Kellicams, closing!

Firing range, sir.
Steady. Continue on impulse power.
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
Yes, my lord!
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
All true.
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
Good for you, Lieutenant.
Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!
You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
How is that...?
You amaze me, Commander.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
I have my orders.
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
<u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.
I still don't under --
All went well. Nothing has happened. Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
Is that a poem?
The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
How can you ask me that? Were we together? Where we going to be? You had your world and I had mine. I wanted him in mine, not chasing through the universe with his father.
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
Jim please --
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
... taking Genesis away from us...
... Can't read you... repeat...
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
David. Please.
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?
You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
Jim --
David --
Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
Maybe...
Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
I know, I know...
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
What do you want with us? I demand --
A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
Never mind! Hurry!
But the child --
What's the matter -- ?
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
Ssssh!
I told you! I told you I saw a --
There's an air-lock.
I saw it -- !
You're crazy -- !
I can hardly see --
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
You know what she'll say...
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
Don't tell me you've got something.
You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.
Well done, Commander.
I see. Helmsman?
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --
And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to --
I shall avenge you --
Yours... is... the superior...
Raise the shields...
Inoperative.
Tactical!
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
Rake her.
We'll lose them if they go in there.
Visual --
Departing dark side, Regula.
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
Well?
Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
No!
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
They won't --
Raise them --
Sir -- our shields are dropping!
Locking phasers on target.
Careful: Not all at once. <u>The</u> <u>engine room</u>. Lock on target and prepare to fire.
Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.
They're still running with shields down.
Let them eat static.
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?
Steady on course. All systems normal.
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
Perhaps I no longer need to try.
Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend...
Time's up, Admiral...
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
Thirty seconds...
I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
That is a most intriguing offer. Typical, I must say of your sterling character. Let me think.
-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
Surely I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life --
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
Admiral? He didn't tell you how <u>Admiral</u> Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
Listen to me -- you men and women --
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
Chekov, who is this man?
I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again.
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
Just barely, sir.
A few shots, sir.
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
Aye, sir --
Aye, sir.
Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond!  Nothing, sir.
I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
... No response, sir.
Admiral --
Mr. Scott on discrete.
I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
She's not responding...
I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.
<u>WHY</u>?
Aye, sir.
Give the word, Admiral.
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
Not at present.
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Admiral, this is Spock.
Aye...
Is the word given?
Oh, no, sir! This is the finest engine room in the whole Star --
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
Yes, SIR.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
Yes, sir.
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
Admiral on the bridge --
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
Sir, you did it.
Phasers locked...
I can't get power, sir!
Trying, sir!
Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
Stop engines.
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
Honors -- hup!
Ready, sir.
We are clear and free to navigate.
Aft thrusters, sir.
I'll try, Captain.
Shields activated!
... Now entering the Neutral Zone...
May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --
Aye, Captain.
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
... They do, indeed.
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
You do this -- for friendship?
Where must you go?
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
Gillian --
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
How're you doing?
Heard there was some excitement.
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
Please...
Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
Fundoscopic examination --
What's your degree in, dentistry?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
I was not informed about observers.
Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
We're out of control -- Rig for collision...
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
Damage report!
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
Can you isolate the wave?
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
What's causing that!?
Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
How long?
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
... It gives me a great sense of history.
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
Find it?
I'm wery sorry, but --
Go ahead. Stun me.
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
I am? May I go now?
You play games with me and you're through
I do not know your name.
No, <u>my</u> name.
My name?
Name?
The top of what?
All right. Let's take it from the top.
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
Like what?
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Yes, sir.
Sir, heat shields at maximum!
Shields, aye.
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
We are launching everything we have.
Can you protect us?
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
"Neutralized?" How?
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
Status report, Admiral!
Aye, sir!
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
I have no control, sir!
10 seconds, sir!
Aye, sir... Three-one-zero to the Bering Sea. E.T.A.: 12 minutes.
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
Three-one-zero, aye!
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
Ready sir.
Aye, sir. Descending.
Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
... Aye sir...?
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
Warp two... three...
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
I can't, sir -- Nothing!
Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Mercy Hospital.
I've found Chekov, sir: he's in emergency surgery right now.
Nothing... I should never have left him...
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
Yes, sir.
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
I am well, Admiral.
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
Do you have the right to murder?
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President.
Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself!  The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people!  We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!
... But it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix...!
Transparent aluminum?
Just use the keyboard...
... Are you joking?
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
Sill? What else would I be working with?
... Yes?
Of course.
If you'll follow me, Professor --
With pleasure.
Professor Scott, if you'll --
Millions?
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
Right on. You fly?
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
Hi.
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet... It is possible that judgment was incorrect.  Your associates are people of good character.
It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
Arigato. Sayonara.  Thank you, honorable sir.
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
Sulu Hikaru.
Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
Ah, chigaau hito da. Hanashi kata ga okashii.  Yes, this must be true. You talk funny.
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?
Very good, Doctor. Picard out.
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
Are they in any danger?
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
And our people?
Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
Safer than leaving her here.
She's stabilizing.
Yes. But look at this medscan...
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
Sure it is. And your hair is still chestnut brown.
You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
I do not take orders from you.
It is not over.
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
Planet's population. Six hundred people. You want to avoid unnecessary risks? Next time leave your android home.
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
Thank-you for reminding me.
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
Deploy the collector.
May I talk to you alone?
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
Recommendations?
They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
We're not waiting until morning... take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight.
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us.  We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
It may not last after we leave. If not, I just wanted, before we go...  I've never actually seen a sunrise.
Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
I don't believe it happened that way.
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...
The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
They... are in opposite directions, sir...
Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
You got me, Commander.
I'll be in Engineering.
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
Even if it doesn't, they'll be teaching kids as the Academy not to do this for years to come.
If it works you mean.
I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...
The purpose being...?
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
Eject the core.
Options?
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
I don't think they believe us.
They're powering their forward weapons array.
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
Eighteen minutes...
Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.
I'm afraid there's too much bitterness... on both sides.
I wish there was a way to bring them back home.
Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived... in terms of my physical condition.
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.
As you wish. But I would ask you to disarm yourselves. This village is a sanctuary of life.
Would you like something to eat?
My name is Sojef, Captain.
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
We're trying to get to you, sir...
Worf to Picard...
I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor...
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
All ship functions are off-line.
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
Exactly as the simulations predicted...
Activating injector assembly.
Initiate launch sequence.
I look forward to reading your report.
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
Good hunting. Hayes out.
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
Bag him.
We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.
Is it Japanese?
How long has he been unconscious?
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
I am the Borg.
You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time.
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done.
Data... are you sure you're all right?
Did you know her?
But how?
What did you do to the batteries?
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
I told you, there's no --
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
Initiate pre-ignition sequence.
Ready.
Main bus...
Active.
ATR setting...
Well, with any luck... the Vulcans will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning... and Earth will never be the same again.
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
These people you're calling "Vulcans"... who are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of weapons?
The invasion plans.
Not yet.
You seem to have an answer for everything.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
Huh.
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
Where are you from most recently?
Not really. I was born and raised right here. Never had much use for travel.
Where in the States?
You don't sound French.
Great name. French?
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Captain...?
Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Aye, sir.
I have to admit there was a moment there when --
What are you suggesting?
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
They're bypassing Engineering...
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
Wil... Data was down there.
Someone...?
We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
Worf? Is something wrong?
Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
Riker here.
They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
Even Data?
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
I'll bear it in mind, Admiral. I think that's all.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
Admiral Donald...Bill...
Mr. President.
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
We're explorers not diplomats!
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.  We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn, Kirk.
It takes a lot of effort.
They'll respect him now...
I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
They'll make it look like an accident...
Course heading, Captain?
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Shields up. Battle stations.
But if she's cloaked...
Where IS the conference?
From Starfleet?
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
Torpedo room--?
Just the size of my head -
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
Where is Mr. Sulu?
She programmed the torpedo hits?
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
ALL uniforms?
Now we go to Starfleet?
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
Shields up, Captain --?
Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir.
Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
Are you kidding?  Send to Starfleet Command...
Do we report this, sir?
An INCIDENT?
Onscreen.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Aye, sir.
Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
This cannot be easy for you, Captain...  I would feel awkward if I had to give you a tour of OUR vessel...
Your research laboratory is most impressive...
Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
I shall look forward to it.
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
Thank you, Captain.
This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.
Kill him! He's the one!!
I like it here...
They'll be here...
Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
I know how to get outside the shield.
It IS possible.
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
Of course not. Anyway, somebody up there wants you out of the way.
We don't get many presidential assassins.
There's a reward for your death.
Krandog aranty.
And your coat.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
Just the prototype.
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
Captain, our shields -- !
Sir?
Captain.
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
I always wanted to try that.
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
Sorry -
Aye, sir.
Kronos, sir?
Aye, sir.
Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock?
Aft thrusters -
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
According to my information, today.
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
Surely not.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
Gorkon's own man??
It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
This is Enterprise. We surrender. Repeat  Enterprise surrenders --
Captain --
Channel open, Captain.
Control tower, reading, Sir.
You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
You can't prove any of this...
I don't want to.
A lie?
Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?
We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
A lie?
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
Not as yet, sir.
Such things have happened before, sir.
How did you - ?
But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
Faith...?
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
We've been ordered to -
Trouble?
Confirmed, Captain!
Direct hit -
No, sir.
You having hearing problems, mister?
Sir?
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
What?
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What's left of it.
Praxis?
... I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.
What is it?
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
Essential as a resource. Praxis is their key energy production facility.  Send to Klingon High Command: "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship traveling through Beta Quadrant. We have monitored a large explosion in your sector. Do <u>you require assistance</u>?"
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
Visual!
I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
Then it's time we were heading home. Three years is...
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
Maybe we should write them a letter?
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
What exactly does that mean?
Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
Yes, sir.
How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
How long is that?
For how long?
No. Can I move now?
No.
I do not understand.
Why?
Why?
Brother. I cannot move.
No.
No.
I am in a room with lights.
You are me.
I was in space for a long time. Then a ship belonging to the Talosians" picked me up. They asked me where I came from. I told them people called the Pakleds" took me from my homeworld. They are fat
Fuzzy face is gone.
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
Why?
Why?
You have a red shirt.
You do not look like me.
Why am I looking at me?
If you wouldn't mind.
No.
It's you.
Why is it moving?
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.

I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.


Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
There's more... as always. He's Reman.
A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.

I look forward to the sport.  Take him.
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
Listen to him, android. Such a small and weak creature. Yet he roars so valiantly...
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
So, human... you've met your better self!
I am not Shinzon. I am his Viceroy. We are sending transport coordinates.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
Your new chair, sir.
Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
Aye, sir.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Aye, sir
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
We're being hailed.
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
Captain!
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
To find the head, sir?
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
I won't do it.
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
What about Picard?
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
Intruder alert!
We're being hailed.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Should I raise shields?
He's a very unusual android.
It is... invigorating.
She is here.
Praetor...
What?!
Seven minutes.
A matter of hours now.
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
No -- this is wasting time.
The bond is broken.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
This is a mistake.
Yes, Praetor.
For the moment.
And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--

Praetor.
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
But surely...
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
How many Warbirds will you need?
They will obey, Praetor.
They're holding position.
Benny, this is me. I'm going to take a look.
I don't think so...
Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?
No, we can handle this.
Don't you think you should call a backup?
Probably kids.
What did I tell you?
Flew?! Oh, come on Benny...
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
Benny, there's nothing there.
It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires?
I don't see anything.
Right in line with that burning tree.
I don't want to scare them away.
Benny, God, take it easy...
We should have. Let me see.
It's still the full price.
I'll have to run your card off now.
Fill this out.  Will this be cash or credit card?
Sure.
Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.
What can I do for you folks?
Have a nice trip.
Gate three. It's boarding now.
And don't be shy about your English. You speak better than a lot of people I know.  Take care of yourself.
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
What do you think of America?
They're damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't trade having them for anything.
Do you have children?
You don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. I got a girl going to college this fall. The wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it.
Make any money?
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
What do you do?
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
About five miles back.
Elmo's...
Stay right there...
What the hell do you think you're doing?
He's got a gun!!
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
Hey buddy... let her go...
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
You could have killed us both!!
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
Wait. Could I have your autograph?
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
Fly.
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
Would be kinda neat if they were. I think I could outrun them. Maybe get my picture in the papers.
They after you?
This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
In the cars, too?!
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
My grandmother's rich.
We're ready.
I did.
Maybe he's turned her into one of them. They enter the crowd around the helicopter.
I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns.
I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
Is it for real?
You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
Bullshit!
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
Hop in.
Where are you going?
Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
You know that's impossible!
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
Judy, that's stupid.
I told you...
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
Hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
Is there a reward in this?
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
Bullshit politics.
Yeah, that's right.
No problem.
Yeah, right.
Hey, fuck you, man.
What's all this squid shit?
Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
Maybe later.
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
You're going down.
A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
What?  Right Here?
Talk to me about costs, here.
Sounds good.
What kind of things exactly?
Clips.
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
No.
That's right.
I understand.  No, I'm not.
I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
About what?
I always do.
Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
I already got everything I need from you.
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
Your existence.
I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
Commissioner Strickland.
Nero.
Aw, Mom!
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Right.  That explains it.
Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
Um... he was older.
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
You got that right. Low became obsessed with the Green River murders, the case had been inactive for ten years at that point. He argued the Green River Killer had actually become Suspect Zero, this master murderer who killed without pattern, killed literally hundreds of victims -- male, female, old, young, straight, gay -- and who was still killing, even though there were no bodies. It went against everything we knew. Low became increasingly paranoid. Every suspect was potentially Suspect Zero. Anybody tried to talk sense into him, he'd accuse them of being out to get him. Deputy Director Koessler was "out to get him." The decision was made to relieve him.
...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
The diner?
No, sir.
Anybody talk to the press?
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
Yeah.
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
A grill pattern.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
That's the thing. Don't know if it connects, but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. Took polaroids after.
Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.
This is Agent Mackelway.
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
Not as much as you'd think.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
I have 6 tons.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
Why me? What do you want from me!?
I've been looking for you.
What do you want from me?
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
What's wrong with me?
You're a... you're sick.
Not bad, huh?
My God.
Take a look, Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look, don't you?
Look, mister...
Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
What are you...?
You know, you ever think about other women?
Excuse me?
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know...
Look...
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
What?
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
I don't mean to be rude, but...
Whole country or just hereabouts?
Yeah.
You must travel a lot, huh?
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
You... surprised me.
Hi. What's in the case?
Jesus.
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
He had an orange hat on.
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
Yes.
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
At the field office.
Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
You have to save this boy. Good exists in this world. I can prove it because you can, in your life, save this one person.
Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This is not hypothetical, this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.
When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
How did a girl like me end up in a place like this?  The Deputy Director here, he believes in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up or ship out, righto? Agent Kulok, when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials. You'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers, some years ago. That's a Dave Koessler trick, find a pliant sociopath, preferably a dead one, attribute to him unsolved cases, clean up the backlog-looks great in the yearly report.
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
Miss me, Dave?
Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
No weapon.
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.
Unlock these cuffs.
Agent Kulok, could you wipe my face?
Agent...
Was it Zero?
The boy's okay. I saw him...
Is he dead?
Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya.
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
Please. You can't hide from me, sonny. I invented the questionnaire. I can tell those who talk from those who do it in the time it takes you to fart.
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
He always had a weakness in that area. I saw it the first time I met him. We all had our weaknesses, I guess. Daitz wanted the money. With Dave it was the glory. Koessler saw the Behavioral Sciences Unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things. He had his eye on the Director's job, even then. Catching killers was a means to an end for them.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
How's the arm?
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
When you exit, head east on 10th.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
Agent Mackelway?
I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.
The little piggie speaks.
[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
[What does the file say?]
[You tell me.]
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
[Not the heart, the watch.]
[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
[Follow me.]
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
[Lionheart, what happened?]
[Reality very risky.]
[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
350 miles.
But why attack an Agent?
Speck is dead.
I don't...
"MyDick?"
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
The same.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
Got a vehicle?  Head north on 54. When you get to New Mexico you've gone too far.
Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
Jesus, just what I need, another blue flamer.  Johnny, get this boy some sun screen.
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
Sounds like fun.
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
What did you do to end up here?
So you're the new meat?
Take your shirt off.
You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?
Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.
Murman!
You're money, baby.
Don't do it, Mike.
You should call your Grandmother.
Are you calling Her?
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
Ever since I've known you.
You've been through worse.
You have to put things in perspective.
Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if...  Skipping message. End of final message.
Nikki.
You better pay the man.
I'd say about two weeks.
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
What's that like?
You're a comedian?
...maybe...
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.
What kind of car do you drive?
What do you drive?
...then ask where you met her...
They're out of Glenlivet.
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
...and even then...
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
Oh. You know.
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...
...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
I still haven't told my folks I didn't get "Deepspace 9". You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now, but Mom keeps asking...
You haven't told then, huh?
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
Hi.
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
What an asshole.
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
Well, no harm done. This is Lisa. I'm sorry, I never got your names...
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
He is so sweet.
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
He's so sweet. He really said that?
The poor thing. I'll make some coffee.
...And she's with someone else.
The poor thing. Six years?
Did you get it?
Oh my God.
I'm a "Dorothy".
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
No matter what... like splitting aces.
Always...
What do you guys do?
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
A couple of high rollers like you?
Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.
You want this in black chips.
You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.
You have to lay it on the table.
On the table.
I understand.
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
It's a rebound.
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
What do you do, Trent?
Well, who represents you back east?
Who's your booking agent?
Why not?
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
Goodbye. I lov...
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
I heard you might be moving back...
No, he's not... Listen I don't want to talk about him. That's a whole other headache. I called because I heard you might be moving back to Queens...
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
I miss you, Mike.
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
You know, us.
Yeah.
Good.  I think about things.
How are you doing?
How's it going? It's been a while...
Don't call me ever again.
Mike?
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
Hang on, Voltaire.
That's right.
Are you ready to order?
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
I'll be back with the coffee.
And you?
Six.
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
What do you wish me to do?
Godfather.
Be my friend.
America has been good to me...
Then make them suffer as she suffers.  How much shall I pay you.
An eye for an eye!
I ask for Justice.
What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
Barzini.
I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
Godfather!
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.
Like hell I will.
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
BA FA GOULE YOU!
Ba Fa Goulle.
Eat it, it's on the table.
I'm not hungry yet.
The food is on the table.
OK, OK.  You gonna make me something to eat at least?
You're staying home.  You're not going out.
Your girl friend.  She says she can't make it tonight.  You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. I'll kill you, you bastard!
What was that?
Shut up.
What's the matter, Carlo?
We gotta move...
The gun will be there.
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
Understood.
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
You heard about your father?
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
Probably all the other families will line up against us.  But, it's alright.  These things have to happen once every ten years or so...gets rid of the bad blood. You gotta stop 'em at the beginning. Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble...
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
You think we'll go for that last place?
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
Good for ten men...
Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
I'll think about it.
Sure.
Outside.
The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
What are you, a dance judge?  Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
You look terrif on the floor!
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
Are you worried about security for your million?
If you think two million dollars in cash is just finance, I congratulate you Don Corleone.
My compliments.  I'll take care of them from my share.
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
Sure.
He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
I'm not rich anymore, Godfather, and...my career, I'm almost washed up...
I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.  When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
An Act of Congress!
Godfather, you understand everything.
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war...
Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore.  I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
Where are you going?
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
Hey, beautiful girls!
Take me to America!  You need a good lupara in America?  You take me, I'll be the best man you got.  "Oh say, can you seeee...By da star early light..."
Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
You tell us about America.
Come Sunday morning:  My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.
Beautiful all over, eh?
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
I know about what you mean!
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight.
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
Mike, you sure about Moe selling. He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
Mike!
That's for you to find out.
Mike!  The party starting!
Ever seen anything like that before?
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
Good...then you can go...  I don't like violence.  I'm a businessman, and blood is a big expense.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.
Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it.
Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny will never get that part because I hate that pinko punk and I'm going to run him out of the Movies.  And I'll tell you why.  He ruined one of Woltz Brothers' most valuable proteges.  For five years I had this girl under training; singing lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing lessons!  We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--I was going to make her a star.  I'll be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn't all dollars and cents.  That girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass I've ever ad and I've had them all over the world.  Then Johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off.  She threw it all away to make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else.
We don't have to disconnect them, we can wheel the stand with the bed.
Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
What is it?
What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...
Maybe.
He won't be; I swear to you be my children he won't be.  Just keep an open mind when we talk.  I hope you're not a hothead like your brother, Sonny.  It's impossible to talk business with him.
I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.
Do you wish to be baptized?
And all his works?
Do you renounce Satan.
Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
I can arrange security.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
Forgive me, Godfather, let our years of friendship be my excuse. How can you hope for success there without your strength here to back you up?  The two  go hand in hand. And with you gone from here the Barzini and the Tattaglias will be too strong for us.
Let us fill up our Regimes.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
You think I scam?
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
Buy me out?...
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
Do you recognize my voice?
No, he should talk to you alone.
I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
Tom.
Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son. Everything is someone else's fault. We all want to sow wild oars. Somebody's got to -- what's the word?  The moment someone confronts him he lashes out. He lashes out. You know, people always say you can't choose your parents, but you can't choose your children.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
Far cry from New York.
Tom. How are you? You look well.
Good. Now you can go for a reason.
Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?  I'd pay you. I'd pay you 1000 dollars.
I see you were at Princeton. Then you'll most likely know our son, Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
What a waste of lives and opportunities and --
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.
San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well, my boy, it's come to a pretty pass, hasn't it?
Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
One minute you people are children and the next you're getting tattooed.
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
I'm sure we've met.
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Three different people saw Dickie get into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't identify himself because he was jumping someone else's wife at the time saw Dickie removing license plates from a red sports car. The Police know about this man because he happens to be a Policeman.
Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows.
Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
Hmm. C'e questa...
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private!
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signor Greenleaf?
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
You like ball games?
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over.
Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.
You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
That's the Colt .25 -- a fine little gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but it's as fast as the Devil. Handy little gun, you can carry it almost anywhere. I'll throw it in for another $125.
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
That's an expensive gun.
That's a dollar forty-seven.
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
Awh, come off it, Pal.
Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here.  Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
Nice talking to you, Travis.
I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes.
There must be something...
Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?
I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
Why, thank you Travis.
Yes I am.
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
Sure.
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
Is that so?
Oh?
Why?
Who?
Why do you ask?
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
No.  Hillbilly, you'd better get your wise ass outa here and quick, or you're gonna be in trouble.
Wha -- ?
Iris?
What's going on?
O.K., cowboy.
Funny, you don't look hip.
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
Take it or leave it.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Anything you say, officer.
Here, officer, take me in. I'm clean. I didn't do it. Got a ticket once in Jersey. That's all. Honest, officer.
Don't stop...  do no stop.
Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
You know how I feel about what you do.
You want to talk about it?
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!
Don't let him do that.
What is happening?  Where's Mason?
Spit it out.
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
Maybe.  Not really.
No.
I had it, a minute ago...
Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
It's possible.
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
He doesn't remember anything, Delly.  Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone...
Well...
That always used to work.
That's my girl!  Did you...?
How'd it go?
Delly?  In here.
Mr. Appleton, you will...
Go ahead, son.
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
Yes.  A prepared statement.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
Here we are.
Ben, when's Delly due back?
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father!
Mother o'god...
Shhhhhh.
Are you saying that he's...
By all means.
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here.  A mystery or a damn miracle.  And by god I can't tell which.  Boy, you say you have no idea who you are?  That right?
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
No wallet, huh?
Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou.
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
What's that?
But what?
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
You think it over.  No reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building.
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
Pete...
Then I'll call you a cab.
I wanna close up soon.  C'mon, let's call her.
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
The G-man?
What.
Pete.  You think maybe you've had enough?
That's where you live.
... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
Thanks.  Well, Sheriff's on his way over, and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are...
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
Well, at least you remember "Moby Dick."
What is it?
It's okay, son.  We just need to call you something.  That's all.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
Here, one of mine.
Lucky you got out, that water's got quite a pull, and it empties straight into the ocean.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
Any idea how you got here, son?
Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here.  I'm sorry.
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
No, I'm not much of a dancer.
You kids off to the dance?
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
Evening, Luke.
Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave.
Huh?
Thirty a month.
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
You think he's drunk somewhere?
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart!
Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
Some of it might come back to you.
Sit.  Play with me.
Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it "heaven music."  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.
I taught you that.
Nineteen-oh-nine.
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
That's my r-r-rent.
T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
Cat.
Found me.
No.
I know more than you give me c-c- credit, that's for sure.  Don't you see, it don't m-m-matter who you are?  All that matters is what you g-g-gave us.  And you can't take that away now.  You're wrong, Peter Appleton.  You do belong here.
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
Oh...
Oh.
Oh.
They will.  They w-w-will.
They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
Thanks.
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
I'll have to think about this.  I have to get back... I should go...
You mean, he was... let go, too?
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
That you got let go.
What happened?
Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?
Don't mention it.  Whoever-you-are.
Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
Got any money?
You hungry, son?
Mabel over there at the diner lost her husband Max.  Okinawa, I believe.
Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor.  Lost both his boys in the war.  Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy.
'Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it?
You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
All right.  All right.  We'll see.
Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist?
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
Who?
Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?
They haven't harmed anyone.
Mom, they're in a cage!
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
Mother!
Just listen to them!
Mom, please, I know all the democracy jazz. They're still hoods.  He's got a client now who shot his wife in the head six times. Six times, can you imagine it?  I mean, even twice would be overdoing it, don't you think?
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
If you do decide to come, don't say I told you about it. It's supposed to be a surprise party.
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
Don't you like us?
Are you coming to my party?
Why, it's just like air, isn't it?  When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
Just a little one.
Could I have a puff?
Is smoking fun?
I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
Miss Daniels?
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
Mitch, let's turn back.
Is she all right?
Why are they trying to kill people?
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
What's the matter with them?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
No, it's Lois!
Lois!
What?
Birds are not bad!
What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world...
Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
Impossible.
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
Gulls!
We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
Well, you're the lawyer.
I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash.
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
Shall I call the doctor?
What happened?
Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?
No. Here's fine.
Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?
No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
Are you finished here, Sebastian?
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
Goodnight, Lydia.
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?
What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there.
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
I'm awfully sorry.
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
He's not home.
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable.  Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them?
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
For what purpose?
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
...insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet. If it weren't for birds...
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
How do you plan to do that?
How?
If you don't even know what you want to do...
Help how? What do you want to do?
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought...
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it. They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened. Poor things.
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
That would hardly be possible.
Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.
They are incapable of organized warfare!
Not if they're starting a war.
We need them.
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Birds?
You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.
Scotch, light on the water.
Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of...
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
Of course.
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
Can't you please finish your drink?
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
I haven't finished my drink.
Then let's go. Now!
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
It is a pity.
It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
-- pain -- and shock.  She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.  Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.
You have his promise, then?
Ask this one favor --
Did he tell you about Georgina?
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
I want you to help my little girl.
I wanted to see the white horse --
I thought this was a school day.
I can't.
I want it --
Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk.  I try to make myself used to it.
He was a nice horse.
The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
Well --
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
You'll be a good doctor.  I know all about doctors.
Are you a doctor, too?
A doctor?
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
But where did they get those people?
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
I come from Lisbon.
Burke them?
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
I know that you kill people to sell bodies.
Can anyone hear what we say?
Yes.
I know --
I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
She would if she could.
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
But can anything be done for her?
Three years.
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
Yes, Doctor.
Nearly a year.
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.
Yeah?  I see doubt oozing out your arm. Where do people go when they kill their girlfriends?
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
Bullshit. You're a killer, that's all you are. A clown with a bird and a rising death toll. You think the world did you wrong?! You did the world wrong.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
See, I heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. How's that going? You find him? Yes? No?
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet?
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
I hate that picture.
I think we should get some support?
I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
Yeah. I sure will.
What do they do that they had to kill her?
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
Check and mate.
Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
Tell her... we'll get him.
Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?
There's no scar, you freak. The Corvis kid made it up.
Fuck! What do you want?
Keep that thing away from me.
That was a fucking hollow point!
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
Who are you?
There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker.
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
I don't know you, man.
Where the fuck did you come from?
There is no scar. I'm telling you.
Fucking Zombie.
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
What Scar? What fucking scar?
You're him. Corvis.
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
Nobody.
Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way.
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
Fuck. Me.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
Give me a hand with this sack of shit.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
Just don't believe everything you see.
He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
How about sign of a big black bird?
Sign of the dead come back to life.
Fucking crow.
Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard was right.
Could say that.
They botched the execution.
Good for you. You do know something.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
I know the guy leaves a sign.
You know.
I know.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
Shut up.
Yeah, we do.
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
Erin knows, doesn't she?
I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
An accident, Nathan.
Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
I mean Lauren.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
What did I say?
Look, can I just call a cab?
I want you... to bend over.
You want me to walk a straight line?
Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her.
If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?
Not tonight. Honest.
But you, you've had them.
She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
What's with your friend there?
Let's hope not. License and registration please.
Anything wrong?
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
He'll be there at 8:30.
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!
Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
Yes, I have!
No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
Okay.
Aw, gee, Mom -- I had plans to play with Mr. Carpenter.
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
Hi Mom!
Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?  I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
Goodnight.
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
Mr. Brady's a cop.
She doesn't like me to steal from people.
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
Well, sure, but--
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
No foolin'? Will you?
Go to the movies.
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
What does that mean?
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
You're just kidding, aren't you?
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
You think they'll ever find him?
Gee! How could they make a landing?
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
I thought that was only for bombs.
Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
Department of Commerce. She's a secretary.  They have a man they call the Secretary, but he isn't at all. My mother's a real secretary.  Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see the space ship?
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
Are you an FBI man?
He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
How does he explain that?
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
I don't believe it.
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs - heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
I'd give you a very good price.
Would you like to sell it?
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
They can tell right away. They've got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital.  Take him over to G2.
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
Well, how do I know who you are?
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
But I suppose you know the answer.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
The baddest!
We are awesome monster-bashers!
Death to all vampires!
Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
<u>Four</u> to go.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
That's just the way we like it.
They're looking at us.
They pulled a mind-scramble on us, man!  It wasn't our fault! They opened their eyes and talked!
Shut up!
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
El Vampiro.
The Prince of Darkness.
Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
All together?
As a matter of fact, we're almost certain that ghouls and werewolves occupy high positions at City Hall.
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
What?
That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin.  Let's stake 'em.
Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
He's not glowing.
I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
You think you're cool, don't you? You think you know what's really happening, don't you?  Well, you don't know shit, buddy.
Or a vampire.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Okay, okay.
I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
Right.  An' now we're having company <u>again</u>.  I'll take mine to go.
Max?  You men we're having company again?
Smells good.  When do we eat?
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
Closet monster!?
Ouch, my hair...
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
I better get cleaned up, then.
Did we have a date tonight?
I hate goin' into town.  That's about as close to town as I like to get.
Are we havin' fun or what?
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
Whatcha doin' over here?
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
Lots more where he came from.
No, I just like to read the <u>T.V.</u> <u>Guide</u>.  Read the <u>T.V. Guide</u>, you don't need a T.V...
... And stay outta here.
You better not like him too much.
You like Michael.
No.  Just you.
It was a dream, Star.
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
Hi... I'm Laddie.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
Dogs don't eat each other.
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
What do you want from us?
Sixteen.
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
What was he doing in the rec room?
Yeah.
That night?
No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!
You can't let anybody leave!
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
No, I... I don't mean infection... or disease...
Anybody sick?
... It could have gotten to somebody...
Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet.
So what's our problem?
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
Maybe.
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
Couldn't make much of it myself.
I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
You promise?
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
Now why'd you go and...
Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
What you doin'?
... I think the whole process would have taken an hour... maybe more. And then I suppose both would have changed back to dog form.
Finish what?
Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
Watch Clark.
I don't know who to trust.
No, you're not!  I don't trust any of you!
... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
Was dark... find a light...
Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator.
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...
You catch anything he was saying?
When we were up poking around his place... I found this...
Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
It's shorted out or something!
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
Childs!  That a fuse?
Lighten your load, sucker.  You ain't the judge and executioner around here!
Thank you.
Damn you, MacReady!
Enough, MacReady!
Now hold him.
I think so.
I guess I'm the only one.
Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
All in Norwegian.
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
My God, what in hell happened here?
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
Well, get to it.
A couple of hours.
How long will it take you to prepare this?
And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
Bennings?
In this weather?
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
Nothing we can do about that.
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
After all this mess.
After all this mess then.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
A day or so ago... I guess.
When was the last time you used it?
I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
A serum test possibly.
Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
What's that?
Right.  Why not?
Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
How many in their party?
That far?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
How far's that?
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
I'll put this right through your head.
No.
Put that down!
Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
Well, stick to it.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
You reach anybody yet?
Hey, man...!
How long's it been?
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
Extinguishers.
We're on fire!
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
He might just wait us out.
What if it doesn't come?
Why?
Where were the flashlights?
How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?
Bet the last place you ever go.
Maybe it ain't coming.
Position, my ass...
Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
Screw the generator!!
Get back!!
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
What about Childs?
Where was he trying to go?
What is it?
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
Bullshit!  He's got to know damn well I cut it!
This storm do that?
That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady.
It's the generator I think!  No power.
MacReady, that you?
We should sleep in shifts.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
You know damn well what we both make of it.
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
Get your gear on.
You jerking off or just pissed?
Can't hear you.
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
What?!
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
Hear what?
You hear that?
When do you think it got to him?
He's one of them.
MacReady...?
... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth.  This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.  It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden --
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
May I help you?
Did you hear me, lad?
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
May I get you some --
Yes, sir, he --
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
Oh, I'm already swooning.
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Hello, Mr. Philby.
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Very good.  Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
Do they?
Might I ask why?
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen.  I received the most extraordinary letter last week.  From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  They are our employers, after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
We are what we are.
This is out life, Alexander.  It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
We choose to believe it.
They've gone to a better place.
Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
We don't know.
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
Of course.  You're just tired. Mara, will you look after Alexander tonight?
My father has gone to a better place.
I am the oldest.
New Yorkers.
Why?
He said he traveled for two months.
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
New Yorkers.
What are your people called?
Well, we're happy you're here. Come inside.
And hungry, I'd say.  You had such a long journey.
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
My fowl have polluted the yard.
Goodnight, Mr. Philby.
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
Sir?
No, sir.
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
For our sake, I hope not.
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
We never should have done this to him...
But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
Should we be...
But... what about Starks?
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
You ok?
I never touched your father! I swear!
I don't know what you're talking about, man. I swear. This is some weird shit you're telling me... and I don't know how come you're doing it.
I thought you said you never knew your father.
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
Oh yeah, what'd he say?
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
Do I know you from somewhere?
Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
They should just be looking harder.
They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
Maybe it's not such a waste.
We're late.
No, it hasn't.
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
Sure.
You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?
Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three, four years ago.
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
Just do it.
Jackie, go play in the snow.
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
Jackie, get in the car. NOW!
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
Great, get in. We'll switch off in a bit.
Can you drive?
I'm going to Canada but I can let you ride with me up to the border.
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
You ever been to jail?
What?
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
See ya.
Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am.
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
What?!
Uh-huh.
What.
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
I gotta go to Little Rock.
In the leg.
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
On what?
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
Why?
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
What?
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
Yes, baby?
Honey?
There's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...!  And you blew it for 'em.  Now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, I'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them.  I've got no feelin' for you.  But I may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance I can actually do them some good, or I'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life.  Your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life.  That's a sincere promise.
You know what?  You're starting to irritate me.
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?
Well, son, she's doin' a damn sight better 'n you right now.
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Alright, Lena.  Go on home.  We might have to call you in for some more questioning.
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
Who do you think did it?
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
Louise, I'll do anything.  I know what's makin' you run.  I know what happened to you in Texas.
You want to come on in?
I do believe you.  That's what I want everybody to believe.  Trouble is, it doesn't look like an accident and you're not here to tell me about it... I need you to help me here.
You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
How are things goin' out there?
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
You girls are in some hot water.
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
I have no problem with that.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
That's certainly possible.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
Alright.
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
All we know is there were two women in a green T-Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast.  We're trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet.  So far, we got nothin'.
Armed robber.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.
Tell us about him.
Get a hold of yourself!  You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry I let you come!
I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're real busy right now, but how many times, Max?  How many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? You could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that?
The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!
It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
Oh, definitely.
Now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out.  And you know Judge Hainey.  He hates this sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well, I think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight, don't you?
My Lord.
Good God.
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her?
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them.
Right.  Where are they?
A .38.
What kind of gun was it?
Shut up.
Louise is alright.
You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I won't hurt you.  It's okay.
It's okay.  I'm married, too.
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
What for?
What's wrong?
You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common.
As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, you are.
Front.
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
Is this your car?
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
You wanna let me see your license, please?
Fuck you.
Fuck that.
I'm not apologizing for shit!
You women are crazy!
What?  What are you talkin' about?
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
Yeah... sure did.
Oh, Jesus!
Fresno.
Grrrreat!
Hi there!  You alright?
Yeah yeah. I'm going to the corner to get a cup of coffee.
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
No harm, no foul?
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
Well, uh, can you tell us his name?
So you admit it?
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
Who?
Yeah, that's more or less what the others said, too. Out getting coffee... supposed to meet him here... picking up my grandma...
Uh-huh. Where was he?
So... I see you made the news.
Because you're a loser, and in some warped way this gives you a momentary sense of worth.
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
Two million copies it sold last year. Two million, man. But not next year -- my idea's gonna blow them outta the water. Get this:  Seven-Minute Abs.
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
Oh. Well I am.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
Thanks for picking me up.
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
Oh come off it, Mare. What about what's-his-name... Steverino? You could've at least passed the baton on that one.
It means you're too hard on guys.
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
I can live with those reflections.
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
Is it the frank or the beans?
She's a dental hygienist. She'll know what to do.
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
You got what stuck?
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you doing?!
Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie.
Yeah? What do you want?
Teddy, be brave.
I mean is it... is it...?
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.
Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.
Well, there's only one thing to do.
Is that bubble what I think it is?
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
Everything okay here? Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.
Ho there.
I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe.
Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah.
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
Eh.
Hey.
Bye, Ted.
Huh...?
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
Franks and beans!
Giddy-up.
Piggyback ride.
And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President.  John Paul Jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral?
Yes, sir.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
Starshells.
What --
Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.
Admiral, I asked you a question.
Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
What are you doing?
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
Tomorrow...
Tomorrow...
With the caveat that it is not made public in any way, shape or form.  And we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest. I cannot stress this point enough.
Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
Yes.
This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
How does a guy get a rep like that?
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
Then you'll call, right?
What if I can't?
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
Complete snowjob. And then we went out and told the country they weren't putting missiles into Cuba.  By the way, you realize we just lost the midterms.
Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?
Where the hell are you?
Kenny. It's over.
Just wanted to see for myself.  They're burning their documents.
Slow down. Smell that?
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
And if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution?
All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
And?
They want us to take our missiles out of Turkey along with the no invasion pledge. It looks like Fomin was a ploy after all, and they were just stalling for time.
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.
Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.
He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
My father --
Oh, still sore about this.
What's gotten into you?
Zorin will eat him alive!
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
What happened to speak when spoken to?
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
It'll be the principals, a couple of the key guys from each department: the Executive Committee of the National Security Council. We'll call it EXCOM.
I'll do it.
We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
Says what, Kenny?
Yeah.
You know I don't mean they're weak.
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --
No it isn't. They don't trust the people that feel this way. But these people are right. And the Kennedys are wrong.  We need you to tell 'em, Kenny. They'll listen to you.
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
I just checked myself.  They're being issued identity cards. Call comes, and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas. They go by helicopter to Mount Weather. We meet them there.
Cuba.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
John. How much time?
Time is of the essence.
And the second condition?
And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
This is from the Highest Authority?
That is correct.
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
Still heading for Cuba.
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
Yes, sir. We can be sure we get all the missiles, and we remove Castro so this can never happen again.
We have high confidence in the expanded air strike option.  The problem, Mr. President, is that it's a short-term solution. Khruschev can send more missiles next month. The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of OPLAN 316.
McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.
A thing like this... who could even think of winning?
If you're home it means either Jack and Bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you, or --
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
What's happened?
When are you going to be home?
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
This is about Cuba.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me. You can influence how this thing unfolds.
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
Deal.
It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
Let him talk to me, he makes Macmillan look good, I print it, the British public likes it, Macmillan owes you.
Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. He can clear the air on Anglo American relations.
I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
I want an hour with him.
How's my favorite President?
What about you? Where are you going?
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
Yeah.
Dean Rusk!
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.
My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
That may be what they want us to think.
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
Just a second, Mr. President.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
Rug samples.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
Yeah.
Don't get too attached.
Hey.
They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.
Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
Again. Figures, man.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
What's this about?
That's right. What are you doing here? This is a religious ceremony you're desecrating.
What are you doing?
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Your relatives must've taught you something.
You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is.
Thank you.
I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray.
Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
You're the Indian FBI.
Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.
What are you doing on the reservation?
Ray. What's your 20?
They took it down, set fire to it, and threw it on the doorstep of room 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your room.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
Ray. X22.
Come back?
Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.
Go ahead, Ray.
X21, give me a 20.
-- your father was part Sioux.
With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
Do you want a coffee?
Ray...
All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more.
Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there?
I blew his back out with a buffalo gun, that's how I know! Now you're gonna say I didn't, so you can throw me back in solitary?
No way. No fuckin' way.
What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right?
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
What the fuck you talkin' about?
Washington sent ya. I know that.
You ever try solitary confinement?
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
What ya want?
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
Remember one thing.
Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack?
Tomcats?
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
One SIXTH the speed of sound!
Well?
Well... What   is   it?
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
What do you want?
What do you want?
You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
You're not supposed to...
Is it you?
Is it the plane?
Is there something I should know?
I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
Gotta go, man.
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
Swell! Passing ten thousand!
I know!
Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
Ohhh Mother!
AND HE'S GUNNING.
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
Don't tell me okay. Do it!
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
So, you're scared--so what? You ever get a good look at me in the back seat, I'm goddamn terrified.
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
Since when did you care about paperwork?
What are you doing?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
Oh...I'll think of something.
Like what?
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
On what?
Well, I don't know. That depends.
Why do they call you Wolf?
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
Why do you all have such funny names?
Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
How was it?
What was that?
So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
Mister to you.
Tom Kazansky.
So I've heard.
So's my Johnson.
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
I was a victim of circumstance.
Come on. I died enough for one night.
Nope. It's the way he flies - Ice cold. No mistakes. Wears you down. After enough time, you just get bored and frustrated, you do something stupid, and he's got you.
That's Kazanski.
He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing.  He just can't seem to follow orders!
Well, you'll just have to make do with him .
I didn't do it, he did it himself. Something about a wife and kid. The fact is, he's lost it. He knows it. I know it. You were up there, you know it, too. GOOSE Give him a break, Skipper. It was raining snakes up there. He'll be alright, soon as all the gorillas go home...
Well, he's going  and he needs someone to fly the plane.
Was.
Don't.
GOT 'EM.
I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.
He won again.
What now?
Hear about Ice?
I didn't ruin her.
Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.
That's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. It was great.
The girl with the purple fingernails?
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
That's because you don't have any women.
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
No, we...got our butts kicked.
It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.
A plaque?
And you were with Cougar. He was my roommate in flight school.
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
Need a hint?
Who is the best.
Figured it out yet?
Well, he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet.
Who's the hell is that?
Some guys never get it back.
I've seen this before.
He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.
He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
Just below ten thousand.
What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
What the hell you doing?
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
How's it goin', Coog?
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
Bad?
You won?!!!
The wings..
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.
Was going.  Now you are.
I talked a man back once. Three months later, we lost him. It's his decision. Only he knows.
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck a mutant?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
Well, there it is; the Last Resort.  Sure you wanna go in?
Cheap domes.  And no air to screen out the rays.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
Man don't know if he's been to Mars or not
First time on Mars?
You're getting off to an early start.
So, where to?
Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
Welcome to Mars.
Over there man.
He ain't got five kids to feed.
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
I think my grampa might be here.
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six kids to feed!
Need a ride?
I'd advise you to hurry.
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
There you go, Mr. Brubaker.  Suite 610 in the East Wing.
I'll go encode your room key.
Identification?
Hmm.  It seems you left something in our safe.
Would you like the same suite?
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
It's about goddamn time.
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
Yes, sir.
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
But I thought...
He had help.  From our side, sir.
No, sir.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
Come on...put his head in place.
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.
We haven't implanted it yet.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
It's not my fault.  We hit a memory cap.
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
You better get down here.
Bob?
Forty-one A, Ernie.
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
Slim, athletic, voluptuous?
Blonde, brunette, redhead?
Hmmm.  And how do you like your women?
Your sexual orientation?
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
So, been married long?
Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now.
Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.
O.K., everybody pull out!
Pull them out.
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.
Arrest that woman!
HER!
There!  The woman!
Where?
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
Watch your mouth, Captain.
Not since you lost him.
Any news of Quaid?
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
They found us!  Everybody out!
Shit!
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
You tell me.
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
On his way.
Sit down.
If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
What the hell is this?
Look at this shit.
Come on!
I've got a lock!  There!
Up!
He's not at ground level.
Split up.  Find him.
I've got a weak signal over there.
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
What is it?
Shit!
He shoulda killed Quaid back on Mars.
Level 2.  Galleria.
Where is he?
I've got Quaid.
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
Are you saying she liked it?
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
I want that fucker dead.
Up to the right.
Where?
Thanks for taking Johnnycab.
The fare is eighteen credits, please.
Would you please repeat the destination?
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
The door opened.  You got it.
I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
What?
I'm leaving it here.  Come get it and keep moving.
This is the suitcase you gave me.
My cannon.
Cannon fuse.
How much you think?
You two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here...!?
What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...
Roger that.
Yeah, still got one poking around.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
No problem.
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
Heather and I are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town.
You guys all set?
Some kind of mutation...?
Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
I'd go for penetration.  The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
What do you think?  Max firepower or...?
I think I scared it!
Knock it off, Burt!
Damn!  Val, we can't get them.  Never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop there is.  Come back.
You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.
Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?
I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
Well, who put you two in charge?
She's got my vote.
Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
In a minute.
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
Just barely, Pham.  What are you all doing up on your roofs. What the hell's going on?  Come back.
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
What the hell you doing back already?
A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.
You bet.
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
We playing cards tonight?
If that ain't the truth.  And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.
How's she doing?
Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
Yeah, Val.
Down, honey, down.
Hi, guys, what you been up to?
God, what a stink!
Come on.  Get away from it!
Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
You sure this is where it was?
It's...gone...!
Well, what's wrong with it?
Ah, but consider this, if we don't finish the roof, we can looks at that sky all the time.
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
What?
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
The con...!  Oh my God.
We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
I'm dead.  Let's finish in the morning.
I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.
Okay, ten dollars.
I didn't do it!  What's going on?
And I appreciate it.
Hey Val, listen.  Bearing going out, you think?
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
...Where're we goin'?
I'm dead. We're both dead.
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
...we had to lick his boots clean.
You're fishing. You don't know shit.
Please... I need to sleep...
I brought it... to the coroner.
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
It most certainly is.
No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
Absolutely.
Correct.
True.
Bellevue. Straight up First --
Don't hurt him.
Gimme back my bottle.
The hell you do. At this hour?
Ms. Vin's sister.
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
The testimony will remain in the record. Do you wish to cross-examine?
Sustained.
Complain to the Bar Commission.
So noted.
I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi.
Sustained.
Shut your sewer mouth!
Let's snuff this lowlife!
If you'd had the sense to ask for my help, I might've helped you. But you've probably scared Chuckie Roeder off for good, I have a whole bunch of jumpy employees to handle and you're both going to be on your way. Now.
"Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister --
I did five years in Attica. Lot of cons helped me in the joint. But I never got help from any lawyer... I built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. "Art's Supplies" is for ex- cons. Not lawyers.
-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
I noticed.
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.
Haven't heard that one before, Ed.  But I guess I'll be hearing it again.
Can't I take a simple piss without --
What about entrapment?
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
Not the whole time, of course. I --
I didn't take my eyes off it!
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...
I can describe it.
You fucking swear to shut up!
You see that? You wanna be like that?
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
You're implying that I planted a gun?
We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.
We had a description of the suspect.
They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants.
Neither.
-- Me? Neither.
...For ten years, now.
I'd l-like to answer the question.
No, s-sir.
Y-yes, sir.
I always t-tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
I did two tours in 'Nam...
Hey, Chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency.
See-cil.
You mustn't talk to Art. You mustn't tell Art that I was at the trial. Do you hear me?
Look. Mister --
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
That's right.
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
-- What trial?
What do you want?
And you b-believe that.
Telephone.  I suppose you don't know the phone company killed Kennedy because he was trying to b-break it up -- and they'll never let that happen. They control everything: what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end, and --
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
That guy they arrested -- he was the wrong g-guy.
You're a l-lawyer?  I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...
She is preparing a great abundance of food.
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
Tell me some other things about her.
Blonde.
What color hair will she have?
A woman.
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
Albert.
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?
I want you to kill for me.
I want you to kill for me.
I am the One who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth.
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
I want you.
I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
My alibi is as strong as these bands of steel.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
It's 4:30. We close at five.
Out back in our morgue.
A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
Yep, it sure is.
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
Can you tell me what their names were?
An old woman and her grandson.
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
God damn, you people are confusing.
I am going over here.
Well, where are you going?
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
That's not the way to Cliff's trailer. I told you.
Thank you, Carl.
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
No, hey, I already told this whole damn thing to Sheriff "Not-Quite- Able"... Here's the trailer now.
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
You try that you little monkey.
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
Oh.
GOOD LUCK, CHET.  SAM, YOU STICK WITH CHET, HE'S GOT HIS OWN M.O. MODUS OPERANDI.  YOU CAN REACH ME AT THE PHILADELPHIA OFFICES. I AM FLYING OUT TODAY.
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU, CHET. SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU. ARRANGEMENTS ARE BEING MADE AND I WILL MEET YOU AT THE PORTLAND, AIRPORT.
GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
NO, IT'S OREGON, PORTLAND, OREGON. IT'S REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF COLE. OUT IN PORTLAND OREGON. I NEED YOU OUT HERE, CHET.
CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
ALBERT?
Teresa Banks.
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
ALBERT, COME BACK HERE. HE'S GONE CALL THE FRONT DESK.
What?
HE'S GONE.
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
Phillip?
COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.
What is it, Gordon?
And no one found the ring?
Tell me about the letter.
Stanley, I heard all about it.
And neither will I.
I'm up to speed, Stanley.
Anything else?
You are here and there is no place to go...
Where am I? And how can I leave?
The later events have never been kept a secret.
That would indicate that it's the future.
Someone else has it now.
Where is the ring?
No.  Ask Irene over there.
No.
No.
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
He didn't suffer.
He's dead -- good and dead.
Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
No.
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem with --
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?
Brother, I hear you talkin'.
Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.
Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle.
I did? I didn't see anything.
You missed somethin', Ed.
Yep...  Yes...  It is.
Nice night.
I haven't got it yet.
You got it.
Fill 'er up.
What'll it be?
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.
I'm so sorry, Laura.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.
No... No...
What does Bob say?
Maybe.
But Bob isn't real.
Who would do that?
Send me a kiss.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
Did you make me a tape?
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
We're on our way, Baby.
Right on time, baby.
But it wasn't him... she was after a huge guy, six foot four with a broken nose. She said he looked just like a boxer. Speaking of sandwiches... I think Bobby was arranging something for you...  Speaking of arrangements...  SPEAKING OF ARRANGEMENTS... Why don't you two come up to the cabin this week? Leo and I know that Santy Claus is coming to town... Thursday.
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
And what a muffin you have.
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.
History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
Exactment. They are nuts about wood. They get goofy over trees.
You're getting warmer.
You'd think so.
No.
No.
Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?
We throw away the whole head.
I understand.
I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in Seattle. He was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. I guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble. His throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. And he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver. I went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy. They were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling. Splat! It just stuck up there and spread out. It was about the size of a half dollar. And that's why I don't ever eat fish eyes.
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
Fish eyes?
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
What are you afraid of? What people think?
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
Josie, I think we should go public.
Good night, sweetheart.
It's a school night... back by nine.
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
Sure you do, it's good for you.
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
Now hurry, dinner's almost ready. Your father says he's starving.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
Laura.
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Leland...
Leland, what are you doing?
Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
Oh, Leland.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
What are you doing?
I can arrange that. I like that.
When's the next business trip, big fella?
What did you say?
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
As if I didn't know.
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
Anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere. To really clean, you have to scrub below the surface.  WHERE THE DIRT IS, SHELLY.
Lay off the bennies, Leo.
Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
Don't worry, Shelly, I'll handle Leo.
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
Come back as soon as you can.
Norma, are you alright?
There's no one here.
You're right. There's no one here.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
You're not busy, sweetheart, now go.
I'm kind of busy, Norma.
Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the "Meals on Wheels"?
Yes.
I'm fine.
Abrams...
As far as we know, nothing.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
Very good.
How good's your intelligence?
Nothing.
What did he find?
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
Yes.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
...tell me about this case.
The man's an ambulance chaser...
Four cases in three years...
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
He was accused of jury tampering.
What is the truth?
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
Yes.
We thought it was just.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
What does it mean?
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that.
It looks that way.
Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You meet him at the hospital.'
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
Mickey told me to come back to work.
I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years.  Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did? Do you know what you did?
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...?
What is this going to cost?
We just...
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
...that's all right.
No. At Chelsea Childcare. Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey? I'm late for work.
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
Missus...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
Kathy Price.
Yes. Price...
How come you're calling me from...?
From the magazine?
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
Mr. Galvin's...
I can't guarantee that...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
Continental Casualty...
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
I didn't do it, Mister.
And ask me what?
Nothing happened.
I've got nothing to say to you.
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
No.
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
He's... you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.  He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
He's not in, Sir.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
That's for sure, Frank.
Yeah.
Thanks, Franky.
Another, Frank...?
You saw Kat in New York...  ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
In New York?
She did?
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
Yes.
Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
As I've said we had some more...
We, we were rather busy...
Yes, the roving nurse...
Yes.
Yes, that's correct.
Yes.
Come on out!  We're friends!
Hey, there - open up!
We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
Hey, how about that!
We'd be in all the papers!
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!
Let's go.
Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
Looks almost cold now, don't it?
I'll request the scientists from Pacific-Tech to monitor the drop.  We'll clear the area all around.  After that we'll hit them all over the world. I'll have long-range bombers alerted, loaded and standing by.
Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
All right - I've seen enough!
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
The same thing that happened on our Pacific Coast.  Anything from them yet?
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move.
You look kinda lost yourself.
Hurry up!  Jump in!
There's nobody left around here now.
Hey, you!  Better get outa here!
We better get word to the authorities and --  Look!
What is that gizmo?!
That needle ain't pointing north!
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
No.  I thought you had them.
If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
It might give us something.
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
It's about that meteor.  They say it's a whopper.  The District Officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit. Thought you might be interested... It's ten or twelve miles from here - over by Linda Rosa.
Looks like the fishing was good.
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
Couldn't you try to communicate with them first - and shoot later if you have to?
It's always been a good persuader.
Colonel - shooting's no good!
I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
So is the town, I notice!
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
They'll probably move at dawn.
Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
We will, sir!
And they'll go out the minute there's another ray.  A cylinder reported down by Huntington Beach.  That's a job for the Navy.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  You're still in command.  Clayton Forrester!  I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir.  I'm Colonel Heffner.
I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator for that reason!
They are living creatures out there.
There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
D.O. to number three..come in.
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
Sure, sure!  Everybody understands you wave the white flag, you wanna be friends.
They'll understand us, all right!
Welcome to California!
What'll we say to 'em?
Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
Maybe these are not men - not like us.
How would I know...!
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
Must be somebody in there.
We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!
Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
What?
No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp.  For Dylan's sake.
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
These look quite fresh.
If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
Absolutely.
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
Diabetes?
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
Call it a guess...
Darker.  More...evil?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Heather?  You doing okay?
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
You okay?
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
I'm afraid there was an accident.  It appears he fell asleep while driving, ma'am.
Is Chase Porter your husband?
Heather Langenkamp?
Listen, dammit.
You're kidding, right?
The car's no there yet?
Studio B.
They wouldn't let me...
Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
'S okay.
I'll call the cops for you.  You've got the number on the fridge, right?
Heather, what is it?
Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
Whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time.
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
It can be captured, sometimes.
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
Killing innocence, one way or the other.
I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.
Maybe we should ask him, hmmm?  We've got a surprised, Heather.  A great big surprise for you and our audience.
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
Do you let your child watch your movies?
Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
Me too.
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
Can I get you something to drink?
Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
What are they doing?
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
I haven't forgotten.
We were idealists.
They've become what you wanted. They're a crew.  That's why he came.
You may not like what you hear.
On the deck of the Yankee, the night you asked me to marry you.  We weren't much older than they are.
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
What?
I am about this.
He knows.
You miss him.
Your father?
Looks like weather.
That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there.
Not yet.
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
Give me some time to blow the man down...
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
Yes sir.
Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
We've got weather moving in from the west.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
I didn't know sir.
Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
Yes, Sir.
Thank you.
Fifteen.
How old are you, son?
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
Why didn't you drop any sail?
It's me, don't you see.  Terry's right, I'm the escape hatch.  I disobeyed order.
What do you mean?
There's still a way.
It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!
You came back, Tod.  You came back.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
No, I can't.
All right.  I'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes...
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  That sound good?
I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
Make us proud.
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
Rick March.  Who the hell are you?
Albatross?
You don't give him enough credit Chas.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
Why then.
I thought this was your dream come true.
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
I know enough.
I gotta go.
Well that's just typical isn't it?
I guess.
Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
What's the difference?
Like this!
God damn it man.  I think he broke my nose!
Hey, shut up will ya?
That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid.
I'm pissin' fire man.
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
Sorry to here it.
I know you will.
Passport?
Do you have your ticket?
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
I can't go in there.
I can't make it out?
I couldn't.
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
That's how he died you know.
It works?
Who told you that?
It was so real...
Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom capital of the world'.
Where are you from any way?
'Cause they're getting a divorce.  That's why they sent me here.  My sister's at Tabor.  They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.
My parents don't do it anymore.
What'd you do?
So... What happened?
Come on man, what'd they look like?
Ya know... "It".
You think Skipper and Alice do it?
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
Forget it.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
Fine.
I can't watch this.
What the hell is going on?
That is unfortunate.  We'll have to take him with us.
Stow away?
But you invited is aboard.
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
No.
So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
No.
Is that what you were trained to do?
Twice.
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.
Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
Well, you never can tell these days, can you?
Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
He's a big boy.
Take good care of my son.
I'll be frank with you.  This was his mother's idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.
I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?
Who is it Philip?
No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
It has nothing to do with him.
Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat...
Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
Oh, really?
I can take care of myself.
Spying?!
Why are you here?
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
I should be eating with the crew.
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.
Jesus.  She's got guns.
What's that?
And being sixteen.
Immortality.
What's that?
Son-of-a-bitch.
I'm sorry, Skip.  It's this damned book.  Lawford gave it to me.
What?!  What's happening?!!
Yes sir.
Yes.  I do.
I think you were too hard on Weathers.
Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
Me, too.
I can show you how to use a slide rule.
Oh, praise the lord.  Relax everybody.  Everything is under control.  The jug head's going to think of something.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we shouldn't have gone.  I tried to tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You guys made me come!  You made me come!!
Why, man?
It matters to me.
I figured it out.
I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
What?  Come on...
How would you know?
If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her.
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
I couldn't do it.
Why'd you jump?
Read on, young John.  Read on. College boards are coming.
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
You know what he is talking about here?
That's not a satisfactory answer.
You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?
If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
We've got a problem.
What do you think?
Tie it off!!
It seems we're short on singers.
Well, that was neighborly.
About anything.
About yourself?
It hurts too much to care.
You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.
No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
What?
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
Son of a bitch!!
I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
It's outta here!
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
No way Phil.  Not like this.
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
Phil.  What are you doing?
There are some things that everybody does in the same language.
But, they don't speak English.
You've gotta be kidding?
What are we supposed to talk about?
Long enough.
How long you been standing there?
I'm not gonna kill it.
Joy, rapture...
I'm not staying out here.
No, sir.
No.
Suicidal...
Sir.
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
Aaauuuhhh!!!
I can't.
I don't know...
I'm sorry...
What?
Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
What makes you so sure it was one?
Sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew.
Were you aware that his brother was killed in a fall.
Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.
Then what are you trying to say then?
If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
And you didn't do anything about it?
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  Everybody goes home.
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier?
May I ask you something?
There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross.  I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.
That's not what Skipper thought.  He was trying to spill air from the main!
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
What's that supposed to mean?!
Easy for you to say.
Screw you, Valentino.  I haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
Thank you. It's listeners such as yourself who made me want to get up out of that hospital bed and back into the studio as fast as I could.
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
Artie? That you, Artie?
Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
Yeah, well, if he says that all that flab turns into dick at midnight, he's a liar.
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
We don't have no paper bags.
I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.
Then lemme throw in a couple more things.
Yessir.
Y'all take American Express?
This be it?
Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
No, of course.
Used to.
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass?
Nice of you to drop by.
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Club Zanzibar.
Mostly black though in that boogie place.
Gas?
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
You hitched yet?
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
So who you out sleuthin' for now?... Can I help ya?
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
No big buildings like in New Orleans.
Muchas gracias.
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.
Only if necessary, of course, and only in my own country.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
That is my permiso.
But I am also with the government.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
Oh, many things...
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. You seen it. Plain filth.
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
Was in all the papers three years ago. I'm seventy-six, was only seventy- three then. Had a business in Buffalo, New York, called Rats With Wings. Killed pigeons for anyone who wanted 'em killed.
My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me.
If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
Sailor... Lula loves you.
I'm sorry.
...Asshole.
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
Hasta siempre.
It has its moments of uncertainty.
Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.
I think they are too serious, these American fishermen. In Honduras, we are not so concerned with the method.
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
The same to you. If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us. The Hondurans are great friends of the American people. But I have a joke for you before I go. If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first?
Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
He is my sponsor. The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras.
In many capacities.
Yes, that's so. But there is not much to destroy.
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
I'm scared, mama.
Why we sittin' here, mama?
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.
You ain't actin', mama.
What I made you do, mama?
How'll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
The Indian official who supplied this information did so only on condition of anonymity. The Uttar Pradesh state authorities last October released five hundred turtles...
The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.
In international news, India plans to release crocodiles in the Ganges, the holy Hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually, to scavenge for corpses, authorities said.
...live in exchange for sexual favors. Police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls, all Asians twelve to fifteen years old, who have been living in the North Houston warehouse with a Vietnamese pimp since February. The girls are being treated as victims, said police Sergeant Amos Milburn. 'These are really just children,' he said, 'but they've been exposed to a lot already.
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.
I ain't heard of nothin'.
I know... I remember.
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
You really are one dumb asshole.
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
By who?
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
He was trying to steal my car!
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem.
I'll be... somewhere else.
I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- Faulknerian nobody.
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
Bullshit.
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
You driving this car?
No. There's no one here.
Better luck next time.
Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.
Her dog, yes.
You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well.
I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.
And your wife left you.
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
How long have you been having them?
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
You did.
Stop calling me Vernon.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
Shoot.
And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What the fuck's the matter with you?
Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
Who the hell is that?
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
How you choose to live your own life is your business. But you be careful with that boy, Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
Goodbye, Grady.
Are you there to not reconcile with her?
Just what? Doing a little dusting?
With Emily?
You're in Kinship?
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
He said he hasn't had a success in ten years and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of a...
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
What's that?
Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
Tony. Now that I'm home.
Sure it is.
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
I need a ride.
Who's he barking at now?
That's a nice greenhouse.
Why yes. How did you know?
Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
Excuse me?
What is it, Grady?
Oh?
It's three-thirty, Grady.
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
Grady?
Who's this ?
Yes?
Thanks -- Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful here...
Holy shit. Are you serious?
Only when I'm working.
Hey, Professor Tripp.
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
Who's that guy?
Sick.
Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
Is it good?
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
Give me a break, Grady.
Why did you come here, Grady?
Ah, right. The book.
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
Where you stand?
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady.
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
I was thinking of you.
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
That's all right. We'll find him.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
No, the dog.
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
Hardapple?
A jockey? You mean, like --
If he's happy...  I'm happy.
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?
But you are taking it?
Are you taking your medication?
And your new apartment?
So. How are you adjusting?
People have the right to know.
Lovers' quarrel?
Just trying to be helpful.
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
I'd keep away from him.
No way that could just be seawater.
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
Okay, good reason.  Then what?
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were--
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
Piece of cake, baby.
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
What is that?  You drop your dive light?
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
You got it?!  You got it?
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
She-hit.
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
Yeah, okay.  Okay.
No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
Lord Almighty.
Where are we?
How deep's the drop-off here?
What's goin' on, Boss?
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
No.
Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
We'll go in through that large breach.
I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Got it. Over.
Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins.
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Do we just leave him there?
That's Perry.
Everything is.
No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
Yeah, well you never should have married her then.
Virgil?
I can't... make it... podner.
Yuh?
It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
Y'all could be more specific.
Missed what?
You watch yourself.
Okay, here we go.  Start equalizing, y'all.
Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
Give me that!!
SHIT!
Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins? Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has known about them for years.  They abduct people all the time.  There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who--
Are we talkin' little space friend here?
Turn it up, bozo.
Quiet!  Quiet!
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
Hippy, you pussy.
Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
Wilhite, anything?
Cab One, radiation readings?
Cab One, do you see it yet?
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
Uh, oh...
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I like that better then UFOs.  Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects.
We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
1840... 50... 60... 70...
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
What's the timer set for?
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
Getting a reading?
Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
Stand by on the ROV.
Check this out.
Hey!
Deep.  It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you.
How deep?
Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep.
Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
He's hallucinating badly.
He can still make it.
He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us.
Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
4800 feet.  It's official.
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
There you go... Must you always spoil everything!
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
A little more so this time.
Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
Wait for what?
Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
Then how come you're not with him?
When do you have to go back?
She'll wait.
We'll send the raft back to you.
Claudia, aren't you coming?
Then why don't you try it on?
Which one shall I wear?
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
I'm thirsty.
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
You mean Sandro, don't you?  Well, I beg of you, please, spare me that. Goodbye, Dad.
You already know what they are.
And have you any other truths to tell me?
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
But how could you say such a thing?
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
Used to what?
Oh, very well. I'll just spend the weekend alone by myself and take a little rest. I should be used to it by now.
Four or five days.
And how long will you be away?
No, Dad, it isn't.
Isn't it fashionable any more to put on a sailor's cap with the name of the yacht?
Sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?
This looks to me like a good sign. Don't you think so? As far as I'm concerned, anyone who reads the Bible could not have committed an act of impropriety. Why... as a matter of fact, I remember when I was in China, many years ago, I happened to be involved in a similar situation, concerning an English woman, the wife of Ambassador Shafford, a good friend of mine. There, too, we found a Bible... And I said at the time that whatever had happened, that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of... suicide. Why, it was logical, I said, that whoever reads the Bible believes in God and therefore...  No? You don't believe it? Well, as a matter of fact, I was right... The woman was found two days later. It was a case of amnesia.
I understand very well. Only I don't want any rash assumptions to be made.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
I presume by this method that you'll be able to uncover some new clue, either a handkerchief or an article of clothing... In other words, something which your men have not been able to find as yet.
As you wish.
But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
What were you and Anna arguing about?... Excuse me for being so indiscreet, but this is serious...
Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
Then why don't we go up and see the ruins?
More so than the shark?
That's Patrizia's way of letting us know she's with us.
Have you decided?
Well?
At the ruins. They're very ancient, you know.
Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?
That must be Basiluzzo.
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
And tell Corrado, too, that I'm here... if he wants me. You can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad, and that at this moment, it's the only thing that interests me. Is that clear?
But why all nudes?
Please, do come... Don't leave me alone with him. He's capable of... I don't know... Have you noticed his eyes?
Please, you come too...
Who are you talking to?
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.
Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
We, too, you know. It was disastrous. First at Panarea, where there weren't any boats... then at Lipari, where everybody was asleep... And the phone call to Rome...
What do you think?
How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat?
If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
I'll stay here also.
Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.
Looks like the weather is changing.
Giulia, that remark is not worthy of our twelve years of honest concubinage. I repeat, once and for all, and publicly, that I admire you. Does that please you?
He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
Who's moving?
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
What happened?
You must know your third grade geography book inside out.
At one time the Aeolian isles were all volcanoes.
I detest comparisons made with oil.
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying...
Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.
It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.
Well, we're still in Italy, you know!
I'm going ashore to take a look around the island. There are some ruins up there...
I think it's possible.
Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
We'll try again.
And what are we going to do now?
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
What is it?
It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
And who is this?
You men are all so dreadful!
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
Where is she going?
What has everybody got against me this morning?
I appeal to you more?
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
Don't you ever paint men?
Me... Goffredo, you're mad!  He's mad.
Why don't you try?
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.
I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
And where do you find the models?
Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.
Here I am.
Giulia...
Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you need is to buy some oils and start painting. Even Rembrandt did the same.
Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know -- he paints.
I ... I ... wasn't feeling well ... I.. I was sleeping... I don't know anything ... I ... I'm all mixed up and ...
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
What other boat?
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
Yes, sir. Three times.
So that's why you've turned to smuggling, eh? You need the money. Now, I can help you. I can see that you get some assistance from the government. But first there's a little formality we've got to take care of. Just a few questions and then we can all go to lunch... Your friend tells me you dropped anchor three times...
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
Ah, no... For me, love comes first. I'm a man, and I know what's what: first love, and then music.
Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one.
But for you, what comes first: music or love?
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
Because this is a Chinese radio.
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
No, not like this one.
We have a radio like this, too.
They told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... In other words, things of that sort.
And what did they say about me?
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
I know, I know. One thing at a time.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
Anything new develop?
Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
Well...probably at the last stop, which is Noto.
I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...
Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
What boat?
From Panarea. Why?
No. The owners are in Australia.
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
You've made some mistake there with the bushes... that's why you can't finish it.
I know, dammit, I know!  And just think -- if there ever was a woman so right, so perfectly cut out for all kinds of dissipations, degradations, infidelities... of.. . of... of debaucheries, it's her. Well, anyway, she's faithful. Faithful out of laziness... of unwillingness.
Patrizia, don't start in again... I would rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to love children.
If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
Lady Patrizia!
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
No, I'm not. Why do you think she does all this? It's one of the many ways she can put herself on display. When you bait the trap, the mouse will snap. To tell you the truth,  if it wasn't for the fact that one hundred thousand lire represents my whole month's salary, well... But you had something you wanted to ask me?
She costs a hundred thousand lire.
Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
Look into the convent records.
???
I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.
Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
If I find anything I'll call you.
You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
You got to be crazy.
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
Marty, what are you doing here?
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
No!
No, no, no...
When?
You have proof?
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
???
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
Martha, it's you.
Who are you?
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
Who are you?
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
Yes.
Oh that one there, in the corner.
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor. You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse me.
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
Do you still go to church?
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
The usual ten per cent?
Of course, John.
The cards... you're bank.
They're yours.
Your cards... lay them down... face up.
Lay them down.
Lay them down.
The police station.
Yeah.
Shurrup!
Read 'em!
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
Oh now, they can't do that to me.  It's all your fault.  Oh yes it is and if they don't turn up I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the...
You don't think...
But I suppose we can survive a missed run-through as long...
Well, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it...
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
Spoil sport!
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
We're nearly there, sir.
I've made the scene.
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
Oh, yes, now I'm with you. [he changes his accent] But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...
Sorry?
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
Well ... come on.
Yes, you're quite a feather in the cap.  Hello, I've got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him.  Of course, right away.
You haven't, you're just late.  Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.
Oh, there you are!
Eh, there's only three of them.
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
The old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, all I said was 'aw go on, be big about it.'
No, I didn't you did ...
Oh aye, but I thought ...
Morning!  Who's that little old man?
Would you two like a cup of tea?
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
What's he on about?
Eh?
Is there a fire, then?
Hiding.
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
For Ringo.
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
That's all right then.
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
Nerves.
But John hasn't got any.
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Who?
I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller than you.
I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
It's not my fault.
Oh, anything you say, Paul.
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
Eh, what's all this?
He can't be far.
Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
Well, he can't stop here.
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.
A proper Aborigine.
Oh, a little savage, is he?
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
What is he?
No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
Do you remember the pyramid?
... I don't know...
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
Are you in pain?
Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
Or something will be able to see us.
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
Engines off.
Kill drive engines.
Locked.
Hell, no!  We don't know what's down there on that piece of rock!  It might be dangerous!  What we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities... and let them deal with it.
Hell, we're equipped --
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
I'm not kidding.  You can get one if you have the credit.  Look just like real cows, too.
Cattle ranch!
I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.
Yeah, it's you all right.
I feel like shit...
Is that you, Roby?
Oh... God... am I cold...
<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
God I'm hungry.
Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly remember my name.
Wretched.  What happened to me?
Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down.
No, I want to go in.
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
Sure.
Maybe we can get in by the top.
I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.
Take a look.
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
But functioning.
I'll go first.
Looks like a derelict.
Receiving.
Close enough to walk to!
Drop begins... now!  Fifteen kilometers and dropping... twelve... ten... eight and slowing.  Five. Three.  Two.  One kilometer and slowing.  Lock tractor beams.
It's... basalt.  Rock.
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
Activated.  Vertical drop checked. Correcting course.  On tangential course now, orbiting.  Crossing the terminator.  Entering night side.
I'll see what I can do.
There are no commercial lanes out here.  Face it, we're out of range.
Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
Yeah.  Two hours.
That's what I'm going to do.
Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.  We haven't even reached the outer rim yet.
I got it.  Oh boy.
I don't recognize that constellation.
Where's Irth?
Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
Unknown.
I have recorded the transmission.
A voice transmission.
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt.  Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.
Computer!  I've turned all the cooling units back on!  What's wrong?
Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Yes!
It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.
Unknown!  What do you mean?
I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise.
What?  <u>Why</u>?
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.
It's still in the ship?
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
Dead!
Dead.
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
Where does that go?
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
What happened to the lights?
That way.
Okay.
Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.
Where's it coming from?
We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
Shit...
But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
I didn't say it was bad for you, it's just kind of sickening, that's all.
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
You know what they make this stuff out of?
It grows on you.
You like this shit?
It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... "  And that's all it could translate.
What do you mean?
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
Why, what's wrong?
Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
Yes?  What is it?
Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?
Not <u>they</u>... <u>he</u>...
What?
<u>He</u> died.
How's it coming on the engines?
Yeah!
Hello, Faust!
Right.  Talk to you.
Well, get started.
Hard to say.
How long to fix?
Has the hull been breached?
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.
That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice?  The food storage room on one end --
The water will still recycle.
What was that?  What the Christ was that?
Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.
Is it alive?
Hurt!  How?
What the hell's going on?
Right.
You just sealed it off; it can't get to that section.
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
Right.
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
Poison gas...
Well we better do something.
It's clear.
Might even incinerate the damn thing.
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
I kind of like it.
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
The engines are fixed.
Hey, guess what?
Here, let me try.
Right.
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
Hell of a defense mechanism.  You don't dare kill it.
I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid.
God, that smoke's poisonous!
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
Thanks for the thought.
Is it armed?
Isn't "bait" the word you used?
I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
It's not going to work.
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.
And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.
And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
Don't count on it.
It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
What common objects?
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
Hey!  what about the film?
I think it's fizzled out.
I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
Look at that.
I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.
Oh no.
How many?
Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
We're not going anywhere.
No.
The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
Can you get them back?
Now what's wrong?
Okay.
They're getting pretty close now.
They're on the next level up.
I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
And what do we do when we find it?
How?
Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
Maybe we could write it together.
I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it "The Snark Log."
We're going into the freezers now.
They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...
Is it still dripping?
Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
Yes, thank heaven.
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
What is it?
Oh God, oh God no.
<u>What is it</u>?
Can you see anything?
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
Sun will be down in a minute.
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
This looks ancient.
That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it...
Air lock?
We should be almost on top of it.  I just can't quite...
It's close, real close.
My signal's fading.
That way.
Receiving.
Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.
What's the frequency?
First contact...
Feast your eyes.
Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs.
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
They never made it off the planet. The parasites won.
Yeah?
We do know that.
About four hours.
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
Could be some kind of venom, or poison...
That tube must be depositing it in him.
It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...
Close...
Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
Look --
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
What can I do?
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
I'll get you out of there.
What did it do to you?
Kablooey.
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
Who gets the privilege?
So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
<u>Hey watch it</u>!
You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.
Yeah... I forgot.
Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core.  In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
It was time for that a couple days ago.
No such luck.  I saw it running down one of the corridors.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
No, I had to seal off a whole section.  We'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door.
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
... More spores coming.
This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
So the next step should be --
I know it looks like a senseless jumble, but if you look closely, there are recognizable forms.
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
Nothing.
Two down, four to go.
By eating our food supplies.
That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
Are you <u>crazy</u>?
Now what?
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
You win.
Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
Now what?
What's it doing, having a seizure?
We're coming!
Where are you?
Yes!
Even simple.
But if we <u>haven't</u> caught it in a week, then we have to go into the freezers anyway.
We won't need it then.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
With great pleasure.
We made it!  Damn, we made it!
Engaged.
Up one kilometer, Jay.
Where did the parasites come from?
If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
Is that its mouth?
Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he?  We can see what happened to him.
Would somebody fill me in?
I understand why you did that.
Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
Here, Chaz.
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
Hey, can you guys hear me?
This ship is full of cat hair.
But why draw it on the wall?
What would you say that was supposed to mean?
Oh well... you know me.
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
What killed it?
I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
Found what?
Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you on my board.
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
Not a one.  It's dead.
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
Yeah, okay.
Engine room, what happened?
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
Oh my God.
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Where are we?
Right.  Fire up all systems.
Yeah...
Better?
Do you want a tablet?
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
What is it?
Sure.
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
Forget that.  I want you off alcohol for at least seventy-two hours. I've got some toxin build-up tests still to run.
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
Headache?  Dehydration?
Wait a minute.
Let's get back and call this in.
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
I told you we... what's that?
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
Yeah, it's fine.
No, it's still breathing.  Kinda clammy though.  Are you sure your stick's not broken.
Is it dead?
It's a rhino.
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
Do you wanna head back and call it in?
Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
Yep...
Minh...
Oh man...
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
Thanks.
Nice howitzer you've got there.
Keep trying!
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.
Get her on-line.  Now!
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
And?
I found it...
Quick!  Run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto-shop maintenance pit.
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
Where is she?
What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
Are you alright?
We're not gonna make it, are we?
Give or take.
Too many.
How many of them are there?
We're what!?
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
What's happening?
Seal everything now!
It's on the board.
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
What do you need?
Okay, give me the numbers.
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
Yeah.  Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace.
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
Better tell the boss.
That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.
No, but I got something that might interest you.
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
You win some, you loose some.
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.
Shit.  When?
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
But...
If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me.
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
Deal.
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
How much air-time have I got?
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
Oh, man...
Do it.
Not yet.
Has anybody talked to them?
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
What's our weapons situation?
Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over the place.
Nooooo!
It's too late!
Force the door.
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
What's going on?
Match it!
Picking up velocity.
Can we move it to a different orbit in time?
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
When?
We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
Where're they headed?
Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.
Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive.
Couple more seconds!
Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones!
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
Is it still moving?
It's alright, it's cool...
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
I dunno.  Might be a glitch.
How?
Wait.  Lost it.
Yeah, I...
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?
Just behind us, over to the right.
What?  Where?
I'm picking up another signal.
What's wrong?
Hold it, hold it...
It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
Still got him?
Yeah, I got it.
Careful of that edging there...
Anything you say, Mammacitta.
But I'm going first...
I'll come with you.
What?
Alright, okay.  Look...
Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
What the hell are you doing?
Fuck the bonus.  I hate heights.  You wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night.
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
Forget it, man.
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
Just got a reading...
What?
Whoa, wait a minute...
That's a fact.
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.
One of 'em must have escaped.
Take a look at this.
What?
Hey, Guttierez?
I dunno.
Something spooking the rhinos?
Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself.
Yeah?
De Vries?
That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
Listen to what?
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
One final point.  Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself.  However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.
Okay.
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
Where does that lead to?
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
What happened?
Thanks.
Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.
How tight are these shafts?
We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
Sounds great.
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
Uh-huh.
Is this the suit?
Which mean physically going outside.
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
Auto-shop?
Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
And...?
Appreciate that.
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
What's the problem?
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
Okay, I'm out of here!
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
Okay, we're in business.
Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response.
Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons...
Okay, I pull the access panel off of the console.  Insert the disk, and press the green enabling button...
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
Thanks.
Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
There's still time to back-out.
What?  Why?
It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.
Well... try the headset.
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.
Looks like it.
They knocked out the external feeds.
How many... how many people are missing?
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
You've checked that end?
Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
What is that?
It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...
Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.
Compensate!
They've changed their heading again.
Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
Already working on it.
Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
Done it already.  Nothing matches.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
That's what we thought.
No!
You have to...
I... I can't!
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
What can I do?
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
Don't wait for me!
Hurry it up.
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
That's the wrong way!
I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!
What?
What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.
So, what do you think?
Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.
Do you believe him?
Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?
Think I spoke too soon...
What do you mean?
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
Agreed.
I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
Hold on...
I've found Ackland!
Check out the tent.
Yeah.  Somebody won.
There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
Don't worry about it.  If the Network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days.  They can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us.  All we've gotta do is sit tight.
Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs.
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
Any luck raising Ackland's party?
Want some?
Seltzer?
Real man' drink.
What is that?
Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
Only six?
Six month stint on Datus.
And before that?
Four.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
Is that a fact.
I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
You got it, cowboy.
Give me a yell is something happens.
'Bout five minutes.
What time's sundown?
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
You should hit the sack, too.
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
How's it going?
Tactical nukes, maybe?
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
Jesus.
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.
Where'd you leave them?
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
That's how you met me. In passing.
We never met. That's why.
Let's go sit by the piano.
I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.
Go ahead, please...
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
But that was the fourth straight time.
I just played it.
Oh.
Morning or night?
--what time is it?
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
--jeeeeeeesus--
--jeeeeeeesus--
--jeeeeeeesus--
What does it say?
I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?
The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--
I'll never get out of here in time.
You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
Well of course.
He is not in the car.  Sorry.
I told you, he had to go out on a case.
And you will.  But not now.
I'm so glad.
Sure. I remember seeing a book about Chappaquiddick on his desk and he was always getting material out of the White House Library and the Library of Congress and--
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--
--what about you?--
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts.  Put him on.  Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid?  Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled.  A wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken.  Ken, I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to.
--it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story--  --I'm not going to kick ass over this, but I'd like you to know I hate getting beat, I just hate it-- don't forget that I hate it--
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story--  --you think I like being aced out?
If they ever start calling us goddamn liars--  --it's time to start circling the wagons.
--Deep Throat?--
--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
I thought you had to get to Miami.
Give me your checkbook then.
You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
Where are your bills, Carl?
We're a long way from high school, Carl...  ...and I'm scared.
I don't know what they'd do to me.
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis.
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
What do you want to know?
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
I'm not your source on that.
--I'm not your source on that--
--my wife just had the baby, my in- laws are arriving, I'm trying to get the house in some kind of shape.
I really can't talk now--
We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.
I will not talk about the other two.
Well, they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth.
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
Try and understand this. I'm a decent Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four years--so did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of.
--they're worse. That's why I quit.
My non-denial denial.
What's this?
--you double-checked both sources?--
--well shit, we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House--  --it would be nice if we were right--
--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
--all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate.
Same kind of crap--
And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
Then it's our asses, isn't it?
The FBI thinks it's possible--the Democrats need a campaign issue, corruption's always a good one.  Get off the story, Ben--or put some people on McGovern's finances; fair is fair, even in our business.
You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
Look--why would the Republicans do it? --my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes--just like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch of 'em.  Why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off, unless they wanted to get caught? Why would they use McCord--the only direct contact to the Republicans?
Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
It's not that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me, or that everything we print the White House denies, or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff.
Go on.
I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story.  I don't think we should cover the story, period.
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
We can't talk inside either?
--I'm not sure, it still feels thin--
--what do you think?--
I got Clawsen on hold--
OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow.  You're certain on Mitchell?
Is he on the level of Assistant to the President or not?
Just tell me his title.
How senior?
You don't mind getting on people's nerves, do you?
Are you implying you don't believe me?
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
They are not my clients.
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
So?
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
Look, I told you inside--
Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
--I'm not here.
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
Where?  What do you mean, where?
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign.
I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper.  I know I shouldn't tell you this...
...you're definitely doing a story...?
...check...?
Good God!
--yes, yes, what is it?
Howard Hunt here.
The C.I.A.
Where?
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
Where in government?
Government. Recently retired.
Where?
Security consultant.
And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?
Will you step forward, sir.
James McCord.
Your name, please.
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?
I really want to know.
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
But it's possible.
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
Are you sure?
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
--well, what if your boys get it wrong--
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
More denunciations?
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
--go over your sources again--
--has any of them got an ax?--
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
--remember Toronto, Harry.
Anyone but Bernstein.
Let me see what you get, but don't jump--The New York Times thinks it's crazy Cubans.
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
Anything?
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
--which Young?
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
--can we use their names?--
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
What else have you got?
Of course--everything they asked--
No, none of those.
A girl. Melissa.
Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.
Badly.  You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered--I gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it.
I can't say anything, I'm sorry.
I won't talk about the other two.
Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
When so ordered.
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
My wife told me to expect you.  As you know, I haven't talked to the press.
I'm not Miss Abbott.
The what to what?
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
Well then keep it coming.  Alright, people, good work!  Keep it up and we'll do great at the state competition.
No, it was good.
What the hell was that?
What the fuck is this?  You got someplace more important to be?
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Good work, Ostreicher.
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
You need some work, buddy!
What did you just say?
Sure.
When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
I thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance.  When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.
Good morning gentleman.
This is no imitation.  Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog.  Behold -- Ultradog, no dog.
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
Neither did I!
I had no idea you'd be this good!
Yes ma'am, I am.
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
Aged eighteen years.  Why don't you get the glasses.  Behind the bar.
Single malt?
All right, I got some scotch.
No, no, that's what the cretins drink. I mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
Pardon me?
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
Me too.  For the most part.
First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
Charming.
Why is this?
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
What do you suppose they're saying?
Seduce her.
You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
Uh-huh.
Yep.
Fuck me!  Yes!
You're so big!
Don't you love my sexy body?!
Give it to me!  Yes!
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Son.  This lady's here for you.
That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Jim?
Okay, well that about covers it.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Do you know about the clitoris?
Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.
These are for you.  From father to son.
You're not...busy?
Can I come in?
What the heck is this?
Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
What's up, fellas?
I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
You are done, James.  Perhaps I should be going now.
Jim...
Can't what?  Do you not want to be with me?  I wish to be entertained, James.
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
Move with the music.
For me?
Yes, slowly.
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
Shame on you!
James!  You have come in here on purpose?!
Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
You are very good in the world history class, yes?
Okay.
I thought so.
What's that?
You've just inherited The Bible.
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
Say that again, Kevin?
Whoop, you're fading out.  Good luck at that party.
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Just dial 976-Asshole.
You called me to ask me how to get laid?
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
Really?
Thanks.
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
But you better hurry.
I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.
You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.
Sure. We wouldn't ask you to do anything we wouldn't do. Now give me your hand... that's it...
Would you shut up?
The key is don't look down.
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -
Uhh! Would you die already!
Exactly.
I'd use pills. They're painless.
Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -
I don't know... Surprise me.
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
God. How can you eat like that?
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
Shut up! Save your stories. The only thing I want to hear is you begging for your life. I want to see you suffer, like they did.  Haha! You're scared now, eh? Come on. Where's the scary monster now huh? Ha ha... We'll see who -
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
Pull over! Now!
You on drugs? Huh?
Okay, what the hell are you up to?
"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
My men think you died and floated away in the Seine. If I wanted to, I could let them believe that.  But that would be illegal...
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
I leave these open. Maybe something comes back to you.
Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
He was a good man. Now his wife is a widow.
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
We know you were with her.
You recognize her?
I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I?
Andy? Andy is that you?
Are you crazy? We have nothing. Let him go, then watch him. If you're right, you can pick him up at midnight. Or maybe he'll lead you to the others. Just let him go.
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
Enough. Cut him loose.
I told you. These murders are not normal.
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
Yes sir.
Now!
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
What did she say?
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
What've you got?
What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
Twelve thirty-six a.m. here. Twelve forty a.m. here. There's two of them. At least.
Hmmph. At least now there's one person around here who doesn't think I'm crazy.
Well?
Here.
Merde.
Get on! Anastasia, get on!
Hurry, Grandmama!
When you're older . . .
"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
I know, but I had to because . . .
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
How to read.
What were you showing her?
I was showing Sonya something . . .
Why were you so late tonight
Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Where is your home, Anya?
Are you running away?
And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
Yes, you do. You do.
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
Is it? Is this what you want?
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
No, not about the ceremony, Anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make.
Don't you, child?
No, no child... shush... it's all right ...
Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
Do you remember this?
Who are you, child?
Shut up!
PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
Bartok... a question.
I'm getting a chest cold..
Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...
You'd lose your security deposit?
Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "Curses were made to be broken". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound...
I cursed then all!
Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
Rodent's intuition, how do I know? She looks exactly like her. Except she's taller, which	is natural ... Of course my second cousin Treplev - he never	grew. Looks like a little pepper shaker. He was so cute ...
How do you know?
Trust me, it's her!
Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
What?
I'll show you!
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
I know, I know ... you thought I was dead. That's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
She does.
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
You are the boy ...
Young	man, I...
I want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately!
Remove him at once.
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
I did no such thing!
You gave the orders!
I had nothing to do with it!
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
It's for my brudder.  Alvy Singer! Hey! This is Alvy-
Yeah, I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph.
Can I have your autograph?
This guy's on television.
This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?
Come on.
What's your name?
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
What's your name?
Hey, you on television?
M'mm.
Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
All the good meetings are taken.
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.
Alvy Singer over here!
Singer!
This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.
Who's on television?
This is Alvy Singer!
What?
Hey!
Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
You're like New York. You're an island.
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
It's an important issue.
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
Can I confess something?
This is my room.
Alvy.
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Step up here!
Who said that?
I mean that as a compliment.
Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
Yeah.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
You have a raccoon?
You catch Dylan?
Oh.
Yes.
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
...as opposed to a print...
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
It's a narrow view.
It's like Samuel Beckett, you know- I admire the technique but he doesn't... he doesn't hit me on a gut level.
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-
You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is that what you said? Oh, I-I don't understand. Are you joking, or what?
Whatta you mean?
Oh, when'd you quit smoking?
What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.
Just give me the license, please.
Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
May I see your license, please?
She's a colored woman, from Harlem!
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
All right-so we can afford it.
Who's persecuting? She stole!
They're persecuted enough!
She was going through my pocketbook!
So the colored have enough trouble.
SO?
But she's colored.
She was stealing.
You fired the cleaning woman?
Di-diabetes? Is that any excuse? Diabetes?
His wife has diabetes!
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
Well, yeah, you always look pretty, but that guy with you...
I look pretty.
Look at you, you-you're such a clown.
Then there was Jerry, the actor.
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home.
M'mmm.
We're going to take them to the airport.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
Now, don't let it be so long, now.
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
I was very charming.
I was a great beauty.
You should talk to Mr. Joe.
It's the way they do things.
Very well.
Oh yes.
A long time.
Like you didn't know.  Who invited the bimbo?
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
I hate the sight of blood.  You guys don't take prisoners.
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
So who won?
I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
What what's about?
I don't know how to make her funny.
Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
You don't have any clothes on.
Not this time.
I'm in mourning.
It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.
She already has.
We've heard lots about you.
Oh.  You're them.
And you know our friends, how?
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what?
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
Yeah, thanks pal.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
I'm fine, babe.
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
Are you always this much fun?
It was fifteen seconds.
Go.
No.  No.  Let me tell you something.  Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.
I meant Sally.
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
You got your DP?
You lose this?
How's he doing?
Jesus Christ.
No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
Time!
What?
Clair is a hovering mother.
Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge.
Break's over.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
Someone who follows his heart!
Invisible!
That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
I'll make myself available...Listen, better watch out with the backtalk.  I don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me.  I'm afraid he got... <u>downsized</u>.
Are you asking me out to dinner?
I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...
Tell me about it.
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
Well...  I declared war!
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
Of course not --
Of course --
We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
Bala!
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
I wonder...what...was it all...for...
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
Z!  Over here!
Don't get all sappy about it!
Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
Superior numbers, kid!
Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
Trial membership?  Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
You new, kid?
Uh, actually, we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir...
What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Come on, you yellow-bellies!  Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
Ant Team Six...
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
No one should have to.  Have him brought to me.
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
Duty calls!
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
Outstanding.  Princess...?
Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
Not that one.  Or that one.
We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No <u>single</u> ant matters, right?
Okay, son.
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Good.  You're a good soldier.
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
ARREST HIM!
What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
May I cut in?
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
In love?  I'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
Affirmative.
Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
Alright, let's move out!
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier.
All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
I'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess.  In the meanwhile --
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my good man!  I don't know what we would do without you.
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
Yes, what else?
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!
What do you see out there?
I'm glad you asked me that question!
Ask me why we're so successful.
YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
Terrific!  You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
So this is your mother's apartment?
Under the mat?
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.
This the place?
That's sweet.  That's real sweet.
I'm getting lonely.  Who are you talking to, anyway?
You wash 'em, you break 'em. I'll come back for them later.  If he makes trouble, give me a yell.
What did I tell you?
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
So what are you waiting for -- a singing commercial?
Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
Something the matter?
It's a bet.
I've been here twice as long as you have --
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're here -- I was just going to get the passkey.
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.  Come on, Oscar.
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
You?
What does he mean, accident?
Fran been sick or something?
What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
Look, Buddy-boy -- if there wasn't a lady present, I'd clobber you.
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
Baxter?
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
Dear Mr. MacIntosh --  Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.  All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far.  Now what is it, Baxter?
Come on, Fran.
Why did you take sleeping pills?
What for?
What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
Always happy to do something for our girls in uniform.
What for? You haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
It won't happen again.
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
Did you have a nice Christmas?
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
Yeah -- you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the Delta.
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
Too far inland.
Terminate with extreme prejudice.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
Ours.
What does that mean ?
You didn't like him.
Would he remember you ?
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
No, it'd be spooky without the war -- give 'em back.
Charlie?
Spooky.
We ain't goin' down the river.
You got a chance in that boat -- by morning you could be five miles down the river.
Nobody comes in here.
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
What is it?
Do me a favor buddy, please.
Yeah, it still runs.
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
How did they know?
Who is he?
NVA regulars. They're coming again tonight. Tet -- their big -- assault.
What -- happened here.
Well, he's killing now.
But why ?
About what ?
A lame ?
He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
This gentleman or myself ?
Okay, Willard, sit down.
We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.
Captain?
Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.  This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise.  Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.
No, I've seen those in Normandy. This is much better.  My country -- my country could never originate this. Magnificent.
It is very good -- there is no current -- It is very good. I have never seen one like it in all Indochina. I was in Paris when it arrived -- do you know what might have caused --
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
We took them from the dead.  Now -- I assume you want to rest, to shower. We'll attend to your repairs after dinner.
Entirely unnecessary, Captain.
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
Wh -- what?
Six to eight feet.
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.
Boss left.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
This is Baker Delta Four -- Captain hit bad -- need dust-off. Receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about thirty yards to our left.
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
Were you with him, when...
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
And you admired him?
Did you know him very well?
It's of strategic importance for keeping the highway into Bat Shan open -- the generals don't like to admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.
Captain Willard -- we got these from Nha Thrang two days ago -- they expected you here then --
Captain Willard?
His name is...
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
I've asked myself that question. I said to myself, why didn't he shoot me? He didn't shoot me, because I had a stash like you wouldn't believe. I hid it in the jungle; the wealth of the Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish -- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut Heroin; the Gold of the Golden Triangle. and Acid -- I make Koolaid that makes purple Owsley come on like piss. Now I'm Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen he talks. About everything ! Everything. I forgot there's such a thing as sleep. Everything. Of love, too.
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
Simple. They don't want him to go.
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
This boat's a mess.
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.
Are you warm, Captain?
But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
Yes.
What's a big question?
What will you do after the war?
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
The war will still be here tomorrow.
Cognac?
You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son.
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
No sir, I think -- this'll be a little bit different --
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
Well who the hell verifies that ?
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
Beverly Hills --
You came right to it, son of a bitch --
I don't know -- don't have any idea -- I'm just the night man --
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
That's 27, sir.

Question is why they sat here when the storm moved in.  Check their stuff while I sniff around.
27   CONTINUED:
26   CONTINUED:
Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
26   CONTINUED:
It's out by the pumping station, shot full of holes.
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
Where'd you say Eric is?
What happened here?
-- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor.  Whatever you do reflects on me.  It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.  People admire him --
I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
You better get some sleep.
Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
I got it from here.  Thanks.
You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
But I would.
No, I better stay at my post.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Pretty clever:  If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look.  They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip.  Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town.  I can't afford any trouble --
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
I'm real sorry.  In a while, you're gone from this country. But we live here.  No one wants to mix it up with those hombres.
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
I'm the one should be sorry... Goddamn Kenai, always out for a score.  I never should've let him go over there.
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
What's wrong?
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
If Corbett's men find out --
-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
Snowplow, generator, TV dish... hell, we get the goddamn Playboy Channel!  Here, this is for you.
Mr. Desmond!  Arthur Neff.  Area rep for the Federal Assistance Plan.  Tell the boys in DC to keep those goodies coming.
This isn't your concern.  It's over, here and now.
Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
Alleged killer.
I could've sat tight for the transport, 'til Bob came poking around.
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
I'm too old for this shit.
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?
Dead.  Trappers killed him.
Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.
He saw you and Corbett come in...
Stay out of it.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
Why the smirk?
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
Ease off.  We do this my way.
You hear me?  Ben?
I'm right fuckin' here with you.
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Thought that door was open last night...
Not in the right hands it ain't.
What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game.
I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind.
Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
Go easy.
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Get the fuck out of here.
I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!
It's a long shot.
There you go.  Wilder's always chummy with the fuckin' Bambi-lovers.
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
They'll have to come right past us.
There's what they're waiting on!
Where's the kid?
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
It's Sam Wilder!
We were just talking about him.
Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
Hang on...  Remember that Cessna we saw at the pumping station on the Haul Road?  Belongs to the guy they got patrolling the pipeline.
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
Meaning he'll need a plane.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
...Ben never sent a signal.
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron.  Had some killings here.  I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands.
Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
Call me as soon as you're settled.
Well, maybe he has nice friends.
How was it talking to him?
I want us to go out.
Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
Go ahead.
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
You're not still writing that thank-you note?
Come on. Why fight when we know how it will come out. This isn't like stocking or a string of pearls. You don't send this one back.
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
You met the gift.
I didn't know you had a secret admire.
Uh-huh.
He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.
Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
Not bad.
I'm sorry.
What the heck do you mean?
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
What the heck are those for?
Yes.  No.
I also regrew my beard...  but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you...  when it comes to people you...
Two years ago...
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
Shall I get her for you?
Actually, I don't think so.
They require a tie and jacket but we have some available.
Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
Good evening.
Frank loves you. You know that... but I've spoken to him and he feels that --  -- as a businessman, with limited resources...
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
You little stinker. He's given you everything.
How you doing, great one?
You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
We will if we can and if we can't, we'll come back and ask you again and again.
Oh, is he dead?
What?
Okay. So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. How come you make a mistake like that?
How do you write women so well?
Aw come on, just a couple of questions -- how hard is that?
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
I can't resist. You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you. You have no idea what your work means to me.
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
Please!! NO!!!
Wait -- I want to see the painting.
So you're practically finished, huh?
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
Do you want Rath or not?
Such language in front of a lady.
They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
Michael?
You're too late.
I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
Yes, sir.
Sure.
Paid in full.
The contract?
Hello, Robert.
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
Who is the mark?
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
Deadline?
I know.  It was a joke.
I don't know what the fuck you are.
The fucking contract!  How in the fuck did he know.
Know what?
How did he know?
A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.
Who?
The contract was stolen.
What?
I'm worried about you, Robert.
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
I don't believe you.
Sick.  The flu.
Where have you been, Robert?
We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
$1,000,000.
Robert?  Robert?
He stole another contract.
It cost us.
I know what happened.
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
Electra --
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
Anytime.
Is that all you want?
Are you asking me if I believe in another life?
Then, I'll sail alone.
All the time.
No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
Sometimes.
Everyone regrets something.
For what?
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
I think you're supposed to answer that question.
Holidays are our busiest days.  No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't.
I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
Hi.  Did you call --
Of course, senor.
Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?
This will take some time.
How would you like the funds?
You wish to close this account today?
No, better than me. You know, I have many friends, you should meet more of them.
Like you?
Your a good guy Chris you deserve a nice girl.
I don't know, maybe I'll enrol for postgrad' studies next Autumn.
It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
So how's your work?
No, you guys are great together. He'll come through, I'm sure.
I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
Cheers Katka!
Hey Doug, you want a beer?
A coke, if they have it?
What are you having?
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
What about me?
Some deal you did there!
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
Doug, I can't just leave you!
It's...42 56 76 .
Yeah, Dave Walters.
What do you want me to do?
And if you're wrong.
Do you want me to see what's on them?
Yeah, somewhere?
Did you see anything in the files?
Lucky break!
So?
I could try and get a Western lawyer.
WE gotta think of something.
You're kidding.
What happened?
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
Honza says they'll print an open letter to President Havel in next weeks edition even if they have to threaten a walk-out.
I stopped by your office. Henry was steaming, he says he's going to throw you out of the window and that you never worked at the Bugler.
They ain't the only ones.
Huh?
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
I don't want to ruin your day.
He's lying! I am.
Does Jahn's thing have a name?
You capitalist pig!
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
What?
Nothing, it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong.
Don't tell me you really are in love?
Well, I take it you're going to drag her down to your minimal existence and adjust her mindset.
A fine specimen for conversion.
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
What happened to Katka?
And a tram hit you?
My God! What happened?
I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.
What?
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
No, not yet.
Forget it Doug, it's no good.
Red or white?
Why don't we go together?
No beer?
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
Do you think anyone will really come here?
Like a hand?
Who put a bee up your butt?
Am I late?
So why didn't we?
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
Let's split.
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
Close!
Like helping a sick kid?
Nope.
Destroy the evidence huh.
I thought you were gonna throw these?
Moved on to plumbing huh?
You'd be better off with tables and chairs.
Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
Yeah, I'll take some.
Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka?
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
Don't we have enough already?
But how did the wall get here?
Can you do the lock on it?
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
I've been saying that since we met.
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
I'm an idiot?
Tough break.
'cause you stink of booze.
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
Thought of everything haven't you.
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
I thought that was part of the charm!
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
You sure got a handle on that word "we".
So?
And put it on expenses?
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
That makes you an expert I guess.
He was an electrician?
That stinks!
No, I got nothing till Tuesday.
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
No thanks, I think we ought to get going though.
We could make a run for it?
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
Care to elaborate?
Like Custer huh?
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
Squatted it.
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
Oh yeah, what's that?
Still, fifty cents ain't bad.
Fifteen crowns.
Who's your friend?
Give'em a break Doug, all it takes is a little work.
What's that? Free!
Yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints!
Never heard of K-MART?
Anything in it?
What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
And not even then sometimes.
But we are underground?
Because it's in English?
How to make a buck!
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
Fresh from the shrink I'd say!
He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual.
Turn around quick!
Doug?
There shooting at something.
Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
It's that one isn't it.
Follow that Budjovice sign.
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Jesus Holly, we got enough time.
Yeah!
That one?
Take this exit.
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
Yeah, pretty well.
No, by road?
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Do you know the way?
Well, he should be on his way back to his apartment by now.
Sure I'm sure!
You're sure?
No!
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
Josh didn't get Doug out of jail, he did a deal in return for some computer disks we'd held onto.
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
What are you talking about?
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
What?
I made a deal with Josh.
Listen, Doug took the rap for us all so grab your coat 'cause you're going.
You don't understand, I can't!
Look, I don't care whether you go with Doug or not, but you_ve got to see him before he leaves.
I can't go with him.
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
Yeah, no problem.
I'm not hungry, really.
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
Turned Czech huh?
I'll take a rain-check for now.
Really?
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
Sure. Excellent.
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
No, it's not true, you're lying.
But I love you!
I'm sorry about what I said, really I am. Just take me with you, I don't care where.
I don't understand, it's your home?
But we could go to London and live in England.
If you get out can we be together again.
Will it help to get you out?
I thought for sure they would catch me.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
Oh sure and you will want sex, always sex.
I thought you loved me Doug but all you want from me is sex.
I think I'm stupid.....All you do is use me and expect me to wait for you.
Fernet and tonic.
No way Doug, I can't.
She's tired.
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
So, we won't be going to London?
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
Doug you said you wouldn't be long. Come on, I've got to go. Now!
I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait for you here.
I don't want to get in trouble.
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.
What? You are crazy!
It's just talk, he's drunk.
What?
I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.
I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
Well, get me and Chris a drink then.
You used to read.
Why don't you read something after the break? DOUG What here? Weren't you listening to what I just said?
So why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
About forty minutes.
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
They'll do it.
Okay.
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
Can we charge admission?
It's not so much.
Sure, they are students.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
Hi, want to take up dancing?
Sure, I've done it easily.
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.
Yeah, for sure.
Tomorrow, we will bring some lights and also hang some fabric. I think it will be finished in the morning.
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
Yo, dobree!
Insurance!
And take Jiri with you?
There's three thousand and if you don't come through, I'm going throw you clean out of that window. Deal?
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
How?
Ah, so what?
I will tell you - within a week I will have the transcript and we can go through it.
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
No, it should be over soon.
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
What is bail?
It's Josh's.
Weren't you going to get some glasses?
Cool!
Why don't we both forget about him?
Better than you.
Yeah, but it was okay.
Uh-huh!
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
Don't you have a girlfriend?
Who you saving the dishes for?
Are you sure I shouldn't get a doctor.
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
I'd better get you to a hospital.
No, just a coffee.
Is it dry?
Shall I wash these out?
We_re not all running away
A champion of lost causes huh?
I figured you more as a Socialist?
What's the Bugler?
Why are you doing all this, what for?
Seems a shame!
Thanks.
That's not what you said last night. And, I didn't bring that "prick" Josh.
I thought I'd help out.
Am I invited?
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
So, he didn't fire you?
But I have to finish this....
Yeah.
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Sure!
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
Yeah.
A drill, what are you up to?
Hey Doug, where you been?
Yes, if you can get him free.
Josh, I need your help. Doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
Can we talk in your office?
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Don't you dare, I'll be back!
You bastard!
Go to hell!
Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
I don't want to go.
Why?
What for?
Later.
Josh!
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
Maybe it is!
Just yesterday.
Subtitles) You have made many mistakes Pavel, let there be no more, for your sake.
Delay Mr Greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your officers drive him home - I'll see to the rest.
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
All the more reason to eliminate him.
I don't care about Americans. Arrest them all if you have to, but keep those records secret.
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
I don't think you realise what will happen if those files are made public. The lives of thousands of officers depend on the secrecy of those records, including your own now.
Have you lost all control of this city?
So, who is in the building?
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
What are you an idiot!
You are responsible...What has happened?
The storage facility will be ready within a week, I'll call you then.
You are quite sure it's secure?
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
Why are there still such headlines?
I do.
No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.
Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --
She asleep?
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
She's coming over here...
With you.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
Landon!
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
She's like some Puritan.
Deranged.
York Ave.
You do --
I'm just wondering --
No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
I need to whizz.
Get yourself a glass.
What kind of a man are you, son?
You.
Who are you?
I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God.
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
No. I want what's best for you.
It's time to tell him.  It would be the right thing.
I'm asking how much.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
Did you give him a gift?
I thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship.
What's Landon Carter up to?
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
She did. It was you.
Jamie wanted that. She told me.
You're marrying again.
Getting by.
You've been well?
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
I helped Jamie with the first one.
For the focuser?
You have materials for the side bearings?
In there.
I need to be with her.
Landon. You go on home.
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle.
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
Either. Both.
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
Your parents are divorced?
How about your family?
You decide.
So talk to us about something.
Landon. You're not the quiet type.
This week.
I don't want to see her hurt.
That won't be possible.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.  Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
You're in the play?
Scalene?
A similar triangle?
Yeah.
Where's your old man?
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the door. If it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?
No....
Uh, yes, sir...
I beg your pardon?
Yes, sir!
I don't know. National Cash Register?
Third time they've been out there this week.
Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
Marty. What's for breakfast?
I think I know exactly what you mean.
You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
I'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. It's funny, but somehow, I feel like....like I know you.
Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
Hi, Marty!
Marty, you haven't been listening. Nobody's asked me to the dance...yet.
But he didn't ask me.
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
Then you'll be going to school here....?
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
You remember me...?
Hi, Marty.
Have we ever met before?
Poly-what?
Here's your jacket!
Seventeen.
I don't think I like the idea of you staying out all night with a girl!
You mean you're going to stay up all night?
That's good.
Learn anything?
How was school today?
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
How are you?
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.
By the way, that reminds me...  Saturday night we're taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food.
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
Run out of gas?
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
You have a name?
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
Mr. McFly here wants to nuke it all, just so he can see it!
You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
Nineteen fifty --
March 11th.
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
Five cents, please.
Local calls cost five cents. What number do you want?
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
Operator...
What?!
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
Good evening, one said. Agents Reese   and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition.  Mind stepping over here?
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
I run this place!
Dick? Dick who?
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
What?
What did you do to yours?
Hi, Marty!
Is  something going to happen Saturday night?
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
Yeah.
Okay.
What's going on?
Oh yeah?
Gone?... Where?
Hi. where's Cato?
I'll catch up with you.
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
No, he showed me one.
Yeah, I guess.
They come with the house.
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Not bad.
Catch!
He never bit me.
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
Yeah.
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
You lost that one?
You ever held another job before?
I mean it.
Good luck to you.
Well, Kit...
Holly's over here, Kit, if you want to see her.
Sure thing. Come on.
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
Then why'd you do it?
You like people?
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
Nope.
Thirty aught six.
We did it, Ray.
Oh yeah?
Yeah? Why not?
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
What're you doing?
Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
Is that right?
What'd you come out here for?
Yeah. I can imagine.
I don't know.
Jack.
Okay.
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Really?
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
Yes.
Fine.
Yes.
Just thinking.
Stay as long as you like.
No.
Yes.
Yes?
Just gimme a chance.
Who are you?
It's mine all right.
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
Maybe.
Wanta sue me?
Beats me.
Hold it right there.
Then that's it!
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
Forty-six Yoyodyne employees.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.
New Jersey?
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
Who're you?
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
They're stealing my chopper!
Not me. No way.
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
Planet 10?
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
What?
Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
So I was right.  That's nice to know...
Apache?
You're a welcome sight...
Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?  You think they're mixed up in this?
What crate?
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away the key.
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
First thing I did.
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
Vanished. Thin air.
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
Where's the professor?
Sam's dead!  Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going haywire over at the lab...
Buckaroo--! Sorry--
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
Let her out?  She's a killer.
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
She wants a picture.
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
We're going down!  Onto the runway!
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
And they got Penny!  Look!
Where're you goin'?
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each other pretty well, I think.
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
A what?
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.
Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.
That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo.  What's it like out there in the real world?
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
Damn John Whorfin--!
But John Whorfin said kill her.
You look!  It's not here!
John Whorfin will kill us!
Not here!  No Overthruster!
I have a radio fix...
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
Should we be on Code Red?
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
What's happening with my call to SAC?
No, sir.  I think the flint...
Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out?
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Asshole probably got lost.
We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.
No!  Ditto the professor-
Any sign of Buckaroo?
Cause Buckaroo needs me here.
Why me?
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
Where do you hail from, Doc?
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
Hey, so was Mr. Wizard.
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
It's Peggy to these eyes.  Same nose, same hair.  Plus Buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right?
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
Pictures don't lie.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
It's a spittin' image.
I didn't drop 'em.
Pick those up, Reno.
Why me?
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
Bet I do.
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
Flying to Cambodia.
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
So where's Buckaroo?
Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 
Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
Drown all those rascals...
Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. People who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity  the basest coin there is.
M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.
...This'll sometimes help.
Well, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish on me  lyin' and deceitful...
If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
...Hello.
Chet! From downstairs!
Chet!
How d'ya like your room!
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.
I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
And what would that be, son?
Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
So be it.
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
Just Bill, please.
I beg your pardon?
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink  you're a goddamn write-off.
I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was  well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
Don't gas me, Fink. If you're opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let YOU run the the studio. It doesn't and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run THIS particular asylum. So let's put a stop to THAT rumor right now.
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
Anyway, I had Lou read your script for me.
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
Colonel Lipnik, if you don't mind.
Fink.
Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
I apologize, Barton.
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings  well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town  but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things  if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool  unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
Lou.
That's okay, that's okay, that's okay  that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing  although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?
Less Hollywood?  Sure, say it, it's not a dirty word. Sat whatever the hell you want. The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures. You don't believe me, take a look at your paycheck at the end of every week  that's what we think of the writer.  ...so what kind of pictures does he like?
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
...Where did we put him?
...Those your only bags?
Don't you wanna go to your room?!
Okey-dokey, go ahead.
...Okay
Kitchen closes at eight but I'm the night clerk. I can always ring out for sandwiches.
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
Transient or resident?
...Are you a tranz or a rez?
Okay then, everything seems to be in order. Everything seems to be in order.
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir?
Look at "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas". These are big movies, Fink. About big men, in tights  both physically and mentally. But especially physically. We don't put Wallace Beery in some fruity movie about suffering  I thought we were together on that.
"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".
Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won't insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. They don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul  well, all right, a little bit, for the critics  but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. Too much of it and they head for exits and I don't blame 'em. There's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten Feet Square".
Yes, Colonel.
Mr. Lipnik, please 
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it!  Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!
Mr. Lipnik, I 
Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it.  He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
...Maybe we should do a treatment.
Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know his hopes, his dreams. Naturally, he'll have to get mixed up with a bad element. And a romantic interest. You know the drill.  Romantic interest, or else a young kid. An orphan. What do you think, Lou? Wally a little too old for a romantic interest?  Look at me, a writer in the room and I'm askin' Lou what the goddamn story should be!
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
We got a treatment on it yet?
Excellent picture.
...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
How's about it, Bart?
Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik.
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran.
Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.
There's no smoking in this building.
When did you start drinking again?
Were you drinking?
All night?
Where were you tonight?
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?
I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here.
The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
Take care, you hear?
We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was a killing.  A professor. Icepick.  In his bed.  Multiple stab wounds.  1977.
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
Did you ever tie him up?
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?
I hope I helped you out.
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
The usual -- a girlfriend.
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
That's him.
Nope, can't say that I do.
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads.
You look like dogshit.
Yeah.  I know.
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there.
You're looking for Catherine, not me.
Is he dead?
What do you want?
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
You knew her, didn't you?
Don't fuck with me, Nick.  I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.
First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen.  They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.
I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything.  I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus.
Fuck you, too Nick.
How you're saying she killed her parents?  Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
You sure?
And you volunteered.
What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.
We bring her in for questioning.
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
I said keep it.
Keep your three o'clock.
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him.
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
It's yours.
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
Catherine Tramell.  Age 30.  No priors, no convictions.  Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980.  Literature and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir.  Estimated assets $110 million.
On what basis?
She's a suspect.
He died -- about five or six years ago.
Only if you're making it.
No Lisa Anderson, detective.
Yes I did.
Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry.  No Lisa.
Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
Are you vice?
It's in New York.
New York.
Saddle River, New York!
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
How much for these five?
These are great.
Is Jean Michel here?
Annina Nosei.
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
Jean, your parents are here.
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
How about right now?
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
You haven't been by lately.
I know that. Don't let him get away.
That's the same guy who did this painting.
MOTHAFUCKAH!
Just look at him.  Little silver thingies on his cowboy boots? Honey, I don't think so.
How do you know?
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.
Who did this?  Who did this?
Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit!
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
You haven't heard? Andy's dead.
I didn't see you.
It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.
It doesn't matter how much you worked on them. It matters how much you can get for them.
OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three o'clock.
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
You have a bunch of them, don't you? Albert Milo walks in from another room.
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
Very well.
Really?
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
Would you like to see the wine list?
Blue? Where?
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
You want me to put it here?
 In this corner?
It's Andy again.
Out?
It's three thousand dollars!
Yeah, it's the best one.
You only want one Big Mac?
You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Would you check out my studio some time?
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
I really... admire you.
Thanks
Some of them.
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
Hi.
You're a fast mover.
I don't eat junk food.
No, I'd like the scarf.
Come on.
How can I ever thank you?
What? What do you want?
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
You see? You have someone to live for.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it  did your girlfriend leave you?
What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
That's a beautiful name. French?
Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business.
Forget it.
You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother  when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
5:11.
So shut up and keep painting..
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
So keep painting.
My point exactly.
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts  you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star.
I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop.
Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
Yeah.
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?
I need this?
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
OK! Goodbye!
That's ignorant.
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT.
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
Uh-oh!
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
Yes, I suppose that we did.
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
I think I'll take the stairs.
I will relay the message.
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?
Wrong on both counts.
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
First you're gonna shut up.  Then you're gonna turn yourself in.
Seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead, or deeply resentful.
I tried to grab you -- save you --
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
We do.
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
...four, five.
I can't sleep either, lately.  A little link, between us.  But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it.  That could put a strain on our relationship.
I just can't sleep at night. Exploding department stores keep me up.  One ...
Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
A "he-man"?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
Good joke.  Wanna hear another one?
Hanging on every word.
As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you?
I'm -- sorry, I --
How could you?  I'm a woman...
"Shreck's."  You --
Where's the fire?
Maybe you're right.
Things change.
What're you really after?
Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
You're not the Mayor.
Admiring your handiwork?
You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
Your blood, Max.
Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
I want in.  The thought of busting Batman makes me feel all ... dirty.  Maybe I'll give myself a bath right here ...
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  Meaning, us.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
You buy this "blurry" business?
PMS.
She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
Dad!  Save yourself!
My lips are sealed.
Well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command.  Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal...
All is shrill, all is blight...
... eight, seven...
Ten, nine...
The boys need help.
Uncle Alfred?
What is it?
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
I'm sorry.  I was too late.
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And...
Oh no, those things frighten me.
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
I'm on break from-
Happy.  You honestly don't know, do you? You can't even see what's in front of your own eyes.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
I guess, the truth is I'm just not comfortable with the idle rich.  Even when they try to act like heroes.
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
Those targeting mirrors are frozen. The sun beam won't work.
It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
I don't know.  It just feels right.
Pow!  What!  Kazow!
I'm afraid to ask.
Why?
This is easy.
Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.
I think not.  There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  You'll get a charge out of this.
Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
I hate being lectured.
Maybe your witless playboy persona works on every bimbo du jour but I am not the least bit titillated by your attentions.  So back off or I'll have you in court quicker than you can spell sexual harassment.  Got me?
Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
I see you knew him.
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
Dr. Pamela Isley.
You were right.  I get it.  You're not the marrying kind.  You've made your point.  Goodbye Bruce Wayne.
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
Bruce?  What are you doing?
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
Who's Ivy?
I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
We've been going out over a year now and...Okay, here goes.  Bruce, I want to spend my life with you.
You're not even listening to me.
And?
But soon...
No!?
Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
Adam and Evil.
Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
You lie!
Where is my wife?
You will rescue my wife
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
Dear daisy, don't despair.
No gun.  How disarming.
I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
Impressive
I'd love to stand here all day and exchange fashion tips but I'm kind of pressed for time.  So hand over the diamond, Garden Gal, or I turn you into mulch.
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
What say we turn up the heat?
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
I find that unlikely.
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
Well, I can respect your opinion.
Join you?  I've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination. When I get through you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry, do you hear me, you psycho?
Without your research, I could never have come this far.  Join me.  The two of us, entwined, side by side...
Our work?
...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?
What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
Four seconds from...
Up here, Al.
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
Big house. How many rooms?
How ya doin', Al?
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
Rinka.
La'chiem.
No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms.  Skol.
Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
The press were just wondering what it feels like to be outsold, outclassed, and generally outdone in every way...  And what light through yonder window breaks? `Tis the east. And you are...
So glad you could come.
No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!
Wait. You can't go.
Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
What? Ah yes. Of course. I'm sorry. It's just that...you're my idol.  And some people have been trying to keep us apart.
Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Bruce, you can't.
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
You can't-.
I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
Save the sermons about how great you want my life to be, okay, Bruce? If it weren't for Batman my parents wouldn't be dead. You don't get it, do you? This is all your fault.
Back off, man.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
I need to be part of this.
Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya.
Okay. I'm outta here.
Can't tell if you don't say please.
Yesssssss. I know!
How could I forget?
Who is it?
Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
I don't think so.
...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons.  Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours.  New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah.  Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt.  Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.  A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
What the hell is going on here?
I'll show you it works.
Fred?
Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?
...The Box can change their lives.  Our stock coupons will spike.
Paranoid? The psychotic?
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king.  Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
Never heard of a double-cross?
Wait! You said you'd let me go!
Just call us Harvey. Can we get you a sandwich? A soft drink? Given all the trouble we caused you, how about we cut you in for a share of tonight's haul?
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
The coin _wants_ to decide.
Please. I swear I won't say noth-
...or death.
What say we flip for it?
I got family. ...Please.
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
...You gonna kill me?
_We_ sure are.
You sunk my battleship.
A hit.
A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.
B-12.
Miss.
A-14.
Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
You're a genius.
Go ahead. You can say it.
Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours.  Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.
Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.
Everything.
About what?
Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
Don't bogart that 'trode.
Not until you do that thing I like.  On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie...  Woah. Harsh toke.
Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
Here. Get a good seat.
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
No.  Wait...
So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
Holy shit.
Let's see if you bleed green.
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
A man with a death wish.
Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
Congratulations. You get to die on the dean's list.
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
How'd you find us?
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
Yes?
Which bathroom is that, sir?
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
... Very good, sir.
Excuse me, sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.
Bruce, we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live.
You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all you expert sources.
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!
MOVE! Can't you do something??
They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
Boss! Jesus! They've --
WHAT??
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
WHAT?
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
Take 'em! I want his head!
We got 'em!
About how pretty you are, pretty boy.  Maybe he'd like to know --
What are you talking about?
Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
I'm on top of it.  If there's a problem --
Don't let your job interfere with your business.  -- Someone's been talking to Harvey Dent.
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
I missed you, Lieutenant.
Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.
My brother's a priest, man.
God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
There was no blood, man.  My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
What are you, scared of heights?
Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
Is that what you "heard"?
Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."
Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
I understand.
Because I want someone I can trust.
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
That's it.
That's it?
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
And what happens if we say no?
I've considered that possibility.
I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up.
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Joker here. Can we talk?
Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
What?  I improved her a little...
Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
... Behind the makeup?
A visual record, yes.  A before-and- after kind of thing.  This could make your reputation.
Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife.
Big day today, huh? 78
Night.
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
I can understand THAT. Neither do I.
He doesn't like to say much does he?
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
Two dollars please.
Well, Ahm....
Oh yes.
Ahm.... .
oh dear.
Ahm.....
Yes.  Ahm... think I'11 ...
Excuse me.
I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Everything okay, David?
You're an innocent and an optimist David - that's why I love you. .  Jesus - what a terrible tie- Come on, the Governor's coming at 3. And before then I have a little surprise for you and the Boss.
Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.
Thanks, David.  Always a pleasure.
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
And howls Alison?
Howls he getting on with the family?
I was hoping DU.  Bean might take a look at my computer project today.
But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
Hey.  Let's junk the medals, Elmer.  This is not a Veterans' reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home.  Not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor.
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
Great news.
Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
I beg your pardon?
Bye, Dad.
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...
Welsh again.
Welsh.
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.  All Englishmen are ugly.
No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.
Sure did.
Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.
Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
... in the distant future.
But is she gonna be okay?
Is Jenny gonna be okay?
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
I vote for Bart.
Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.
Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.
Okay.....
It is urgent, sir.
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
Yes?
Doctor Jacobson?
And I'm sorry you look that way, short-ass.  That suit stinks and you obviously dye your hair.
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
off the peg?
Interesting suit.
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
Sting?!  Sounds like something you put on a rash.
Come on Sting!
Are you?
Of course he is.
You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
You.
Nope.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
Shut up, Kevin.
Washington! That's where she was gonna meet up with ya?  Damn, she's goin' all the way!
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
Yer late.
Does that say Xanax?
Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
They perk me right up.
Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these.
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
She sure does.
One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?
Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo-hoo!
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
That's why I'm bussing it across America. I'm so glad you're here.  Jim, I want you to meet two nice boys.
It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
Hey, you wanna see something really cool? Huh huh huh.
Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Yup. Huh huh.
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
Who sent ya?
You got two seconds!
Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
Does that mean you'd consider it in two weeks?  You don't have to answer now.  He wants me to check the deed restriction anyway.  You take your vacation, Adam.  Say 'bye!
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
You'll be rich!
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.
D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
You don't have an appointment, do you?
Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
Start simply.  Do what you know. Use your talents.  Practice.  We only help those who help themselves. Just do a little at a time.  And of course, practice, practice, practice.  It's tricky but -- you weren't murderers by any chance, were you?
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
The Intermediate Interface chapter on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em out yourself.  It's your house. Haunted houses don't come easy.
Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
No.  What's wrong?
Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
You people have really screwed up!  I received word that you allowed yourselves to be <u>photographed</u>.  And you let Betelgeuse out and didn't put him back, and you let Otho get ahold of the handbook.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
Yeah.  He still tries popping up all over the place.  But he can't join the party unless you call on him.  Get the Deetzes out by yourselves! I gotta go.
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
No.  You don't want his help.
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
-- Like you used to be?
What do you expect?  You're dead.
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
Barbara Maitland, sweetie, you just listen now.  This house is too big.  It really ought to be for a couple with a family.
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
Well, I just placed a call to your mother.  She had stepped out but I have some news for her.
Hellooo!  How's school?
Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code.  I'm sure you're going to be very happy there.
Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
Yes, sir.
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.
Would you care to take it, sir?
Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.
I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.'
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
I don't want Robert.
Really? Really!!!
... Are you sure you like it?
Do you like it?
Can you see well?
Oh, you can tell her later. She'll never miss you in this crowd.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir.
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
... Sir?
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
Good day, Mr. Chance.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
... Oh.
Some pictures...?
What about money?
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
... Then you really are a gardener?
Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.
Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
Very good.
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
Please, sir.
It's starting to swell, is it painful?
Let's have a look, do you mind?
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
... Yes sir - elevator!
Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, I'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others...
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
I said - try again.
Sid, it's useless!
Try again.
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Try again.
... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch...
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
... Nothing.
... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of First American. But before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background...  ... Kinney, what did you come up with?
Yes, ma'am.
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
And look who you brought with!
Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
... Would you take me on a tour?
... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
I said good night!
Good night.
... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
Very good, Your Excellency.
Clearly, yes comrade.
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
Let us toast to the success of the coup.
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Okay.
John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
Who am I thinking of?
The one where you're that jewel thief.
Malkovich!
John Makel...
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
Oh, I will, and I have many, many friends and associates, my friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters Anonymous. All of them fat and alone like me, all of them dream of being someone else, all of them with John Malkovich as their second choice!
Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!
Oh, this is just the medical breakthrough I've been waiting for. Are their any side effects? Please say no! Please say no!
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
Music to my ears! Whatever you said. Speak, speak, speak, my magnificent friend, speak!
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.
Yex?
Mr. Juarez?
Money, Miss Warts?
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
Pardon?
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
That's right, Wendy, it is against floor policy, but as long as you're here, let me tell you what I know about our cute little door friend. Many years ago, this very office was occupied by a kindly old watchmaker named Mr. White.
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what its for.
Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
Ha ha ha!
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
Hello. Wendy.
Hello, Don.
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness. I learned that from you.
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
Can I be anyone I want?
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Fine. Let's drop it.
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Why are you being like this?
But I think I have another plan.
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
Impressions? Those are hard.
Vegas? What'd you think?
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you?  Nice to meet you all.
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
Think, Jew florist?
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Fork ah did?
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Says me. Do you dream often?
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
Do you dream often?
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
Count me in.
Do we get to wear a crown?
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
No.
Great then.
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
Yeah, I saw them
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
Captain Mertin, surely I am a God-fearing Christian woman like yourself, but alas, I am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie lady, Captain. after all, who would marry a person of my diminutiveness? So I am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist. Why cannot there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable?
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
What want ye, girl child?
Captain Mertin?
..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
You remember Halle.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
No. Sorry.
What do you know about it? I sleep where I want.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
YOU HURT ME.
and she is mine...
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
I want somethin' sweet.
That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
Baby, don't be like that.
You don't sit with me!!
NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN.
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
WILL YOU STAY?
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
YES.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
Extra?
Well, what can you do?
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
No...no...no..
She likes this dress...
Nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's going be doing that..nobody going be writing my daughter's characteristics on the animal side..no sir..I don't care..ain't laying that down..no sir. I refuse..that's right..that's right...
NO!...She wanted me to do it.
Go upstairs I said!!
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Morning.
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
Don't matter. First time I'll be late in nine years. No great trouble..Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter...  The world is in this room, baby. This is all there is and all there needs to be.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
No, let her rest.
Could be that fall you took.
Back stiff?
She was my best thing.
She left me. She's gone again.
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
No, You looking good.
You shaved.
Paul D.
Yeah. Too sweet.
Make it the way I always do.
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.
I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.
What? What? You talking back to me?
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
Look here..There's a cross up there, so I guess this here's a church or used to be. Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
Hey!!
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Dude, I finally got the venue I wanted.  I'm Performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and I'd love it if you came and gave me notes.
You're not dealing with morons here.
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
He looks like a fuckin' loser.
What do you think?
Fuck.
Uh?
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
Yeah?
Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear?
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
Well maybe you and me could pool our resources--trade information-- professional courtesy--compeers, you know--
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
The Gundersons.  It's a wandering daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man. Her real name is Fawn Gunderson. Her parents want her back.
The Gundersons.
Hey, man, I'm not--
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
NUSSING!
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY!
Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen.
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
That is our most modestly priced receptacle.
Sir, please lower your voice--
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
Yes.  I understand you're taking away the remains.
Excuse me?
They range up to three thousand.
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
That is for the urn.
We have the urn.
That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!
I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes.
Separate incidents?
Your rug was in the car.
And what do you do, sir?
In the briefcase?
And was there anything of value in the car?
Color?
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Howdy do, Dude.
Take it easy, Dude.
Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude. D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?
I like your style, Dude.
Far from it.
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
I've heard the kidnapping story, so save it.  I know you're mixed up in all this, Dude, and I don't care what you're trying to take off her husband.  That's your business.  All I'm saying is, I want mine.
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
Of course, you do get the good with the bad.  The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software.  Wave of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.
People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone--
Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
What's your drink, Dude?
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
Right, Dude.
You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you.
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there is no funny stuff.
Okay, listen--
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?
...Us? DUDE
Who is this?
--so, like I say, just thought, you know, fair warning.  Tell Walter.
Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and I know it wasn't your fault, but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gene and I will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round.  Or maybe forfeit it to us--
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
You happy, you crazy fuck?
All right!  There it is!  It's fucking zero!
Walter--
I'm not--
Yeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the marker, Dude,  I'm marking it an eight.
Yeah, but--
Bullshit. Walter!
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
Someday.
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
He's half yours, partner.
<i>You'll</i> take him.
We'll take 'em in the morning.
Whatta we do about the Mex?
Wanna hear something more impressive? My first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the Olympic. Says maybe you <i>could</i> take me.
Impressive.
Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.
I came all the way down here same as you did.  Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--  Habla Ingles, Tomas?
You come all the way down here to roust--
Seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.
Put it back in park, Blade.
So?
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
And so will we.
And why is that?
True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
Not alone.
It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too.  In that regard, I should thank you.
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
Nomak?
What's going on?
So you're going to do this?
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
I don't know about this, man --
You got something in mind, Blade?
Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
We want to attract them, not scare them off.
Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
Oh yeah?  Like how little?  In case you hadn't noticed, we lost two men while you were out farting around.
Well you've got it, warmblood.  Now what the fuck are you gonna do with it?
Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
From his father, of course.
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
Any game worthy of being played is.  One must be patient.  In this way, I have outlived my enemies.  All of them.
No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
Two so far.
Any casualties?
They've made contact with the Reapers.
Yes?
Us?  What are you talking about?
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
It depends.  We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Not that I'm in contact with.
I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
Back when Blade had me hunting down your puckered old ass.  What's up with your hair, anyway?  Fucking Willie Nelson look-a-like?
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
I was backpacking.  Hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the Burning Man festival.  We were gonna take "E", have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert.  You know the riff, "Dear Penthouse, I never thought this would happen to me, but --"
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
Look, what's your problem?
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Scud.
You're too human, Blade.
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
Take him.
No longer.
Watch me.
You sure now? I bled a newborn for this. You won't find a drink that's sweeter.
The pause that refreshes --  Care for some? Smells good, doesn't it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron.
Am I? You think the humans will ever accept a half-breed like you? They can't. They're afraid of you.  The humans fear us because we're superior. They fear us because in their hearts they know their race has become obsolete.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, "the Day-walker".
I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. We've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
You've been here longer than you think.
I am tired. Dawn is coming.
Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  "And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood."
The vampire God. This speaks of His return.
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
Show me.
Hold out your hands.
There are other ways to see. Sit.
Is something wrong, my friend?
There's only one alternative to the serum.
I was afraid that might happen.
You're a week early.
You will. Time is on our side. Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that.
You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world.
Deacon brought me back.
Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --
Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
He looks different now, burns are less extreme, some of these wounds have closed up --
That's weird --
Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
No problem.
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
What about the chemistry panel?
Then what is it?
The other elders will never let you get away with this!
How do you like that? Right on time.
Perhaps.
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
He is an abomination!
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
Why should I respect something which has outlived its purpose?
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
You're wrong, Dragonetti.
Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race.
You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life.  Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle.
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
Who better to usher in the Blood Tide?
LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
--stop it! Stop talking about it! I'm gonna freak!
Sometimes. Where are we going?
To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.
Trying to find the energy.
Yes.
Let's talk to your husband--
Mrs. Leavitt--
Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
Looks like a rope.
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
Beta Cam's still coming back tomorrow, right?
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
So lemme see it.
--go!
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
Turn the tapes back on.
Something. Someone.
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
--there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
I don't know yet.
I don't think it was them.
No.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
--no, I think they're all in there.
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
Sometimes.
Both. Now.
I want amphetamines.
--and we brought it back with us!
Why she kills children.
No. I don't think so.
At least you still have the tapes.
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
Not planning on sleeping at all.
What?
Oooh. Oooh.
Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
Look at those marks--just like in the movie.
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
Why?
What is all this shit?
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
Get some more beer.
Sure. I'm sorry.
That's why she kills children.
It touched me, don't you see it now?
That's the <u>reason</u>.
Jesus.
Are you alright?
What'd you say?
No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
Still working on it.
Okay.
He'll never know.
There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
Then I have no idea.
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
--no.
The four of you really have too much spare fucking time on your hands, don't you?
--thank you for calling--
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
--yes--
....Ma'am?
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
Your mother's pastor.
She wants me to talk to you, Heather.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
It'll pass.
Going out with Meurice.
About ten years.
You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
I don't follow baseball.
Thanks.
Remy.
Ever durned one.
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
Sure don't.
Channels, we got two and six. Two don't come in so hot.
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
I reckon I can hear him. TV option, that's a dollar twenty, makes nine eighty-six plus tax.
I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.
He needs a room, Dusty.
Lubbock?
...Friday?
What?
Yeah.
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
Yeah.
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Sign.
Back where?
...What was that back there?
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
What's the matter?
No.
...You know that car?
...Hell.
Well now you do.
See, I never knew that.
I told you. I like you.
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
...What're you gonna do in Houston?
Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...
...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
Yeah...
Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.
Uh-huh.
...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary.
What?
Tuesday.
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Okay honey.
I've seen a few.
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
I'm not sick.
Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck. cheers.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
To your health, Frank.
Darling, where are the glasses?. Oh. here they are.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. goddam!!! This is the suavest guy I know. look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?

Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Frank. Come in.
Not yet.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
You're all through with this now?
Who knows you have these?
Is Sandy part of this?
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Okay?
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Jeffrey! Come on in.
It's blue. blue velvet.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Yes.
The criminals are winning.
Okay.
If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
Jeffrey?
And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.
Come into the study a minute.
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
You did? A human ear?
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Yes.
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  . Hey, pretty, pretty.
Can I feel 'em?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Look at these. What are these?
Then, shut up!
You want to see him too, right?
Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh?. You wanta go for a ride?
Who's this fuck?
Baby wants to fuck.
. MOMMY!.
. my bourbon.
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see. I'll get you.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
He's comin' back?. What for?
Bull.
Frank gone?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?.
What are you lookin' at?
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back.
Hey? . You like to walk.
Do you see, Ben?. I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Go where?
No thanks. what does that mean?
Good, let's drink up.
There ya go.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
What kinda beer do you like?
Okay Frank.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Look Jeffrey.
No Jeffrey!!
Go ahead!
Go ahead.
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
Probably not. no. Why?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Dorothy Vallens?
No.
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Okay.
Just a minute.
NO.
Really?
You want to dance?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
It's okay.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
It's good to see you.
What was that all about?
What is it?
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
You didn't tell him about me?
Everything okay?
Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
You like mysteries that much?
Jeffrey?. Why?
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Jeffrey!!
Oh yeah?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
Shoot.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
What am I going to do?
You were late.
Goodnight.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay. be careful.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you.  . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Who, me? Why should it?
Yeah?
Did you see her undressed?
Twice. without her sensing anything?
You saw a lot in one night.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You want to tell me about it?
You want a Dairy Queen?
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
He got a little jealous.
What did you see?
Well, how did it go?. What happened?
Okay, okay. Bye.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Okay. yeah, call.
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
O.K.
Yeah. but.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
I'll drink to that.
That sounds good.
This is not my usual Friday night!
Brilliant.
What's the plan.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
You really want to do this, don't you?
Yes. I do.
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
So. what's next?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
Are you alright?
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Alright.
You've got a point there.
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Now, how are you going to do that?
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
I'm here, aren't I?
Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
I don't know.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I've gotta go in.
What happened to him?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
I don't know. you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Maybe so.
No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
That's too bad.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Terrible. boring.
Yes.
Am I bothering you?
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Good to see you, son.
uh uh.
uh uh.
Hey Jeff.
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Of course, Jeffrey.
Alright.
Do you want the car?
.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Jeffrey. honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do. it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
I'll get a coat for her.
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Anyone else?. Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
He comes over to study.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
Would you like a piece of cake?
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
... Stop it Mike.
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Okay.
Come on out a minute, okay?
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
You can change it if you want to.
What are watchin' this junk for?
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
On the plane.
Greetings, Mr. George.
I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't appreciate it.  You tell him I want my money by Friday.  Can you do that?
Oh, I see.  George.  Well, that explains everything.  Open your mouth, George.
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I 95, north and south.  My brother-in-law. Happy birthday!
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
Let us walk.  From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.
Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.
Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
Dejen la maricada pues!  No jodan! Nadie va a matar a nadie!  George, debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica manera, mano.
Blanca, por favor.
Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada.
I don't know.  Drunk somewhere.  Try the bar.  And if you find her, tell her to come, it's almost midnight.
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
So you do have an agreement with the United States Government, Mr. Jung, correct?
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
Excuse me?
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.
Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. For everyone.  For you, and you, and you.
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
Why are you speaking?
The coca is my responsibility!
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
Tell me about the suitcases.  What is the make and the color?
Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.
What's that?
George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
No fucking way.
Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and start an i.v. stat!  This man is having a heart attack.
In how long?  A week?
Cocaine?  How much?
He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
Oh, I see.
I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
G-d, son.
You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a killjoy.
Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.
Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.
You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
Yes.  Of course.  But, I'm talking about that ring.  It's something else.  Let me tell you.
I just can't get over the size of that ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.
Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him. We've got him dead to rights.  But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.
He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals.
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
How are you doing, George?
Source?  What about Derek?
What the fuck are you talking about, man?
Look what the cat dragged in.
Tuna.
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money?  Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.
Figured it out.
Tuna.
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money?  Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.
Figured it out.
We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time.
Okay, George.
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
They're over at the booth.
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
It's a four-man operation.  Two on the ground.  Two in the air.
Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
For instance, something like this?
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
Are we good?
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
So?
What?
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
I wish there was shit like this back home.
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
No, man.  I'm too fucked up.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
Don't be such a pussy.
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
You know, he's got a point.  We're fucking Americans.  We stick out like sore thumbs.
This is bullshit, George.  We're never going to find anything down there.
Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich.
What's the matter, George?  Something wrong?  You look like you just fucked your mother.
Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
Smith.  Hampshire....
That's right.
No shit, Kevin?
Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
Nice weed, huh?
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs.
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
And you believe the NLF?
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
No. It has failed in its objective.
The strike is a success; but ...
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
I understand. What's your question?
Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
It depends on you.
And here?
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
Exactly.
Dien Bien Phu?
It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
Third group. What's your assignment?
Third group.
What "group"?
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
Second district ... Explain better ...
Second district ...
Which "district" do you belong to?
Sail.
Second name.
Sid Ahmed.
Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...
What ... What must I decide?
How much are they paying you?
What's happened to you?
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
You afraid of these ...?
No. Not you, or any one of us. As long as we are free, the NLF continues to exist in the Casbah. If they manage to take us too, there won't be anything left ... And from nothing comes nothing ...
Of course. As soon as possible.
It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
Not enough.
Because we aren't ready yet for the French. Before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. We must either convince them or eliminate them. We must think of ourselves first. We must clean out the Casbah first. Only then will we be able to deal with the French. Do you understand, Ali?
Then don't complain.
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... In other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test. I could have told you to murder the barman, but he's an Algerian ... and the police would let you kill him, even though he is one of theirs. By obeying such an order, you still could have been a double agent. And that's why I told you to kill the French policeman: because the French wouldn't have let you do it. If you were with the police you wouldn't have done it.
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
I'll explain.
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
Here?
Sure ...
Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...
Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
Why?
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
Yes, I think so too ... It's been organized well ... But what will the French do?
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
It's good nobody is following us ...
Let's try ...
I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question.
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
But it's not even midnight yet!
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
Good evening ... Can we pass?
Good evening, sir.
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
Rue de Thbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thbes?
Good evening, sir.
Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
Where were we?
Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.
Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
Let's hope forever.
Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.
Yes, a name for the operation.
A name?
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
What is she saying?
No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
Of course I am.
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.
Why?
Yes ... But let me first see you.
Are you ready, colonel?
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
How can I give you this statement?
Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement, Mathieu, and then we'll surrender.
We don't trust you, colonel. Come forward, show yourself.
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
Who is speaking?
Did I say it was a natural death?
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
An inquiry into what?
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
Then you can go.
Yeah.
How?
I think I'm going to make your day.
That's the best part.  She gets it all -- everything.
What about the will?
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
So she knew about his heart?
He can remember at least one occasion -- and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied Marsh to the office.
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
Thank you, Doctor McCurdy.  Your witness.
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
Then how did it get into his body?
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
What induced it?
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
Any prints on the nasal spray?
What can we prove?
What are you saying, Henry?  That his girlfriend fucked him to death?
But there's more?
The official cause?
What'd he die of?
Cause?
Your witness.
No -- never.
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
Could you be more specific?
Sex.
What was the nature of the argument?
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
Did they argue the day before he died?
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
What did they argue about?
Like cats and dogs.
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Yes.
Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?
Counsel approach the bench.
Objection, Your Honor.
You may call your next witness.
No questions.
Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
Objection sustained.
Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
You get his statement?
Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
Objection!
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm building a case against her, remember?
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.
What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you.
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
Your Honor -- please!
Objection, Your Honor.  The fact that Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesn't mean the incident never happened.
Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs Crawford's educational background has to do with this case.
Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
Aren't they all?
Then she's not as smart as I thought she was.  You've seen her in the depositions.  Tell me you don't have any doubts?
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning.  We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
Sit down, Frank.
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
What did Mr. Marsh say?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
How did he look?
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
Tell the court about that, please.
What about Miss Lawson?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary?
Thank you.
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
Her name?
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
Why did you come by?
Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas.  You arrived at what time tonight?
Show me.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
She was here?
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
Who found him?
Yeah.
Is it Marsh?
Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.
Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
Yes.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?
Yes.
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
About a year and half ago.
Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?
Thank you.  The State rests.
Who was your primary beneficiary?
Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
What happened after that?
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.
What did she say?
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
Can you give the court an example?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
Why do you think she left you?
Why did she say she was leaving?
Why not?
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
And how are you now?
What happened next?
What kind of condition are you referring to?
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
How long were you together?
Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
Cocaine.
-- And what did you suggest?
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
What did she say?
Yes -- Insulin and others.
Did you suggest any?
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
What kind of information?
Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me.
Why?
We stopped seeing each other.
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
Yes -- several times.
Did you ever see her again after that?
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
That's enough.
You called him?
I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
No -- she asked me about cocaine.
I was angry.
No.
Yes.
Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.
No.
No.
We had dinner at a restaurant.
No.  No, I don't.
No.
No.
No.
Yes -- quite easy.
October twenty-seventh.
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
It's a white powder that comes in a vial.
Chinese peony root.
Yes.
She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
Oriental medicine.
No.
I heard him say it.
No.
No.
There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
Yes -- he did.
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
I realized he wasn't serious.  He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.
We dated for about a month last year.
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
Yes.
Sorry.
You know I can't talk about that.
Frank -- what are you doing here?
She's waiting in the conference room.
Well, I guess that makes you the best.  Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit three million dollars.  As executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us.  All I'm asking you to do is talk to her.
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
-- But it's Sunday.
Why?
I love you too, Dad.
Is Mom yelling at you too?
Yeah.
She allegedly humped him to death?
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
You better.  Please answer the question.
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
The witness will answer the question.
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
Maybe you don't know what it's like where Mrs. Crawford comes from -- but I do.  I came from a neighborhood just like hers.  This is a whole other world for her.  She's a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly unsympathetic people.  So, she puts on her best dress, fixes her hair and tries to present herself as intelligently as possible.  Being poor and having pride is not a crime, Mr. Dulaney -- and before you attempt to impeach another witness' testimony in my courtroom -- your foundations better be based on something other than semantics.
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
Daddy -- stop it!
Sorry.
Not even if they're a dork?
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
Albert's got the stomach flu.
It had to get there somehow.
Did Marsh use it?
What time did you leave?
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
She changed.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
She used to be so friendly.
Oh, yes.
She's changed.
I'd laugh first then I'd kill them. Make sure they heard me laughing.
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.
No, what?
Mrs. Delaney.  Did you hear the latest?
Don't talk about what you don't know. Besides, she's too young for "the changes."
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
What do you know about "the changes"?
Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.
Well, nobody put a gun to his head.
I'll get right on it.
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
Heat is heat.
Not this kind of heat.
They got heat in Michigan.
Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
Oh, that'll be nice.
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
You want me to call the doctor?
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -  "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?  He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.
What about your husband?
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
I just want to say... I know you had your own dreams. I'm sorry I couldn't give them to you. I love you so much.
Franny?
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
I'm going to miss you.
Frannie.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
Now?!  It's after eleven.
Where you going?
What time is it?
'Bout 4:30.
Sure.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
You feeling better Franny?
They're not going to find her!
I don't remember!
I was paying the check. She ran outside. I told her to wait for me right here! Oh God, where is she? Rebecca!
Oh my God...!
Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
It clearly states in the will --
Apparently just before her death.
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw --
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
You people really don't like dogs.
Take my advice.  Get the hell out of there.  It's a bad place.  Always has been.
Yeah?
Hey, kid.
How the hell should I know?
Died there?  How?
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
Is it true?
Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Then what do you care?
Hell no!
He yours, sir?
Hey, watcha doing with that dog?
Go for it.
Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
Damn.  It's so...fresh.
You think that's really him?
"This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stones/Gold plated deuce, like the King of Siam/Got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand..." There's the switchblade and there's the diamond.  Don't know where the deuce is parked.
What the hell you talking about?
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
Some flies?  I think this qualifies as way more than "some."
Just some flies.
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you.
'S up?
Take who where?  What you smokin'?
You didn't hear that?  "Take him... " Something.  "Bury him" or...
Keep smokin', fool.
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
Are you nuts?
Look around, this place is a dump!  Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
Bones!  How baddass is zat?  This is the place for us.  Patrick, you get platinum props, man.  Platinum.
So what the hell's the good news?
We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
Or just Hell-adjacent...
Climb out to where?
Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
Well, go find his lazy ass.  I scratch any more tonight I'm gonna have carpal tunnel syndrome.
Where's the gangsta of love?
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
Where's the others?
No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.
Shit.
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
Pat's right.  It'll be fun.
You soundin' like the old man now.
You want us to move in here?
Damn.  That is the ugliest building I have ever seen.
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
But that's your old hood, Pops.
That's some terrible shit.
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
Wh-wh-whooo?
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
Looking to score?
Go on.  It won't kill you.
Just try it.
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
But things change.  You gotta think ahead.
You got a nice crib here.
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  Covered with blood.
Mother!  No.
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
Who?
But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
You said bad things hurt places.  So maybe good things heal them.  Good things are happening here.  Maybe for the first time ever.  And maybe that's all it takes.
All the more reason I should be here.
You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
And what's that?
Have you ever been inside?
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
You mean as opposed to your life?
I have to finish this for class.
I can't!
I can't find you.
Patrick, he's...
I'm here.
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
I can't.  Not yet.
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house.
What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
That place is already bad luck.
Guess it's not Rossmore Park.  Thanks for the help.
How do you know?
Are they on the radio?
You moved into this block?
Fuck it.  Alright.
Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't shitting you.
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
Where is it?
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Yeah, but you got to come the rest of the way on foot.  Leave your car and walk over here.
You got the shit?
You got the cash?
Back here.  At the end of the block.
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
Nice rack.  How old is --
You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
Well, somebody bought it.  That's what I heard.
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
Now you.
What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.
Last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job.
You was just doing your job.
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
No time for eightball.  I got your tip.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
Shit, that was fast.
I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey, Sal.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.
No more thoughts from your asses.  Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?
We just thought...
How many times I told you, no psycho shit.  There gonna be psycho shit, I'm the one that does it.
But --
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
Maybe I oughta open a couple holes in that head and let all them voices out. You'll feel better, I promise.
It was just like in my head.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
You boys been hitting the pipe?
Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
That's all we did, steal their ride.
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
We didn't do nothing, Eddie.
"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.
I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
Just what army do you think the Colonel was in?  Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan.  "Special recipe".  I'm telling you.  There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
Yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash.
Potential toxic dump site.
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
You haven't?
Jimmy Bones?
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
Sqweeep.  We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
Not really to live, just to play.
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
And some people need their medication tweaked.
What we have to do is call the police.
Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
How could that be?  The box was packed!
Give it to me.
Gimme the gun.
We're family, Caesar.
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
You aim a gun at me?!  Do you know who I am?!  I am Gino Marzzone.  You understand?
Caesar!
Caesar?  What is this?
We know how this was done, eh?
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
Go right ahead, sir.
Not on duty, sorry.
It's all right, sir.
Pretty good, sir.
Leave your phone on the hook.
You got the key?
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
Where in the hell is he?
Fuck it, I don't need the key.
Hey, Caesar, where's the key?
Is that the money?
Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they.
Why'd you move all the furniture around?
Cease, can I ask you something?
Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, I'd probably do the same thing.
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
We went over to Johnnie's place just to check it out and it was busted up, Bad.
We was worried about you, Cease.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you.
Caesar, you still got the money?
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
What?  They ain't there?
Yeah?
Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?
Are you okay, Violet?
This is a beautiful place.
You did the right thing.
See?  We're for real.
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
This is the police, ma'am.
Johnnie, what did I say?
Hey, Johnnie ...
Done.  We go now.
Caesar, come here.  Sit.  We talk now.  You too, Johnnie.
No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones. Not now.
Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this girl, or I find out!
Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
Violet?
I think everything is okay.
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
Don't worry about Caesar.  I'll handle Caesar.  You just get out of here, okay?
You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk.
...they won't let you go...
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
...it's a problem...
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
...which one are you?...
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
Get the kids out!
<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters, wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps.
Sir, you waited on line.
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
You have your passport?
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
You're a U.S. Citizen?
One moment, sir.
-- sir? --
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
Yes, sir...  How can I help you?

I think not...  No, I'm sorry.  It was very sudden. He was here very briefly.
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
His brother.  You know his brother?
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
There was an accident.  On the motorway.  Apparently, he was killed instantly.  Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
I have some very bad news for you, sir.  I'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...
You are a friend of his?
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
Was it the break-in?
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  I'm assuming you're still in the market.  It's the same vessel?
Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it?  Cutthroat.
We thought you were gone for good.
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
So get the hell out of here.
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
Wait a minute --
What the hell're you talking about?
What?
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
My husband's out looking for him.
xxxxxx...
So now you're asking for a student visa?
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
-- I'm on it --
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
Sir...
Hang on...
That's the only angle.
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
All of them?
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
Zurich police are looking for an American with a red bag.  Apparently he put two cops in the hospital last night.
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
-- he accessed the account --
I tried.
Abbott wants to talk.
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- what're you talking about? --
I won't forget this.
It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.
I don't know.
You drink rum?
I don't remember Zurich.
Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
No.
It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
I told you.  You need to rest.
What if it doesn't come back?
You we're lost at sea.  They pulled you out.  Who are you?  You were shot -- two bullets -- in the back.  You understand me?  Who are you?
How did I get here?
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
<u>Where am I</u>?
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
Where am I?
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
You must save the day.
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.
We know that too. You've come to the right place.
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
You don't have to sing it.
It's reply paid.
I'm waiting for my daddy.
Layton.
Her name is Jill.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
Beginner's luck.
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.
Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
- In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life.
In fact, killing people -
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?
Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
I understand, Sam, I know exactly how you feel. So I brought you a bottle of barley water.
Gillian Layton?
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
Too late? That's for me to say.
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
Your father and I were very close. Of course Jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing  and I  keep his name alive at the office every day.
If I can help you ...
Thanks very much Sam.
Oh.
Ah.
If you say so.
You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
Information Adjustments.
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
Is it stamped?
Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself.
Hey - that's my desk!
Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off, standing there! Go back to your office and I'll give you a knock when I've finished.
Sod it, it's broken!
You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
This is your dream girl, is it?
A woman eh? I see.
I'll tell you what .... You tell me what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of a whizz on this thing.
You want to take my console into your office?
What?
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's clinic who never come back at all.
I won't be held responsible.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
Numero une, crevettes  la mayonaaise.
A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
We're meeting Mrs Terrain.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
You remember Samuel, my son.
I'm sorry but ...
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
Not now ... please
Sam!!!
It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams.
Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.
By the way, I saw a wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.
What were we saying?
It's something for executives.
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close -
He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
What have you done with his body?
My husband's dead, isn't he?
Mistake?
Shirley and I come here regularly. I love romantic lingerie.
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
I know, I know ...!
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
Numero deux, duck a l'orange.
It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce.
Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have?
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
Put the phone down and your hands up.
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Thank you for calling Cen -
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
No need, sir
No, sir.
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
Madam ... CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
Numero, trois.
Monsieur. Quel numero.
Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
Time to go.
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
Are you expecting anyone?
No. But I can bypass it with one of these
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
Ha!!
Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Go on, get outta here, Pierce, before I give you a big hug.  I love this guy.
I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
I'm sorry, Pierce.  You're going out with Marcus. Duty calls. The City needs you.
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
I've never fired anyone in my life.
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
It's a miracle.
Es impossible.
Is she dying?
She say she in great pain.
No, no, that's impossible.
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
We are virgins.
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
Stressed? He's psycho.
He flipped out.
He looks like a cop.
Hey Cy, guess who's here?
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
IB Bangin.
All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
No way, man.
He's going to be all right, right?
Oh man, Bucky.
Sure, sure, give go.
Here, you try.
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
What did you say?
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
No, no medicine!
See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.
Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
Crazy fucker.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
You can't believe how much he's improved.
Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.
I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
Would you like to come in?
You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
He was tough. You did all you could.
How can that be? He was getting better.
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
Thirteen Zebra. One-Three Zebra. You're going out of service in two seconds.
Answer the radio Zebra. You know it's that time.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
Ravenous homosexual.
I don't like the word gay.
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
Okay.
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
Your hair's a little funny.
Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
Move away from me.
No.
My gosh, and for a while there, I was attracted to you.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
Goodbye, Paul.
I was a little nervous there for a minute.
We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready.
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
If we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Almost immediately.
Just when do you start, telling people?
I'll speak to you soon
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
Well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
Jane?
They canned me.  Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
I spent a fortune on this.
Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
It's Aaron.
Yes.
And Bobbie says...
I liked it.  He's not afraid to be human.
What did he say?
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
You don't have time.  Not a chance.
You know, I like Tom, because hi...
Because...
Do you want him all the way to the car?
Should I...
He said something about...
We could...
Well, who knows.  Just let m tell you what my favorite teacher ever, told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be wonderful.'
...good-bye then.
Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
Anchor?
Is everything all right?
Okay.
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
I wish it were you giving the story.
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
I see the change in you -- I see it.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
One's enough.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
Bad manners.
You talked me into it.
How do I get out of here?
They're not really going to call security are they?
Okay, sweetie.
I could use somebody to talk to on a day like this.  Sorry. Go ahead.
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
What?
It's Paul.
Ernie, they're calling from work.
Finish quickly.  I don't want you getting obsessive about these things.  Good night.
You don't have to finish tonight.
Jane -- For God's sake...  Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
Honey?...
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
As long as that's your only problem you're...
You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
Go ahead.
Why so glum?
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
I had no idea she was this good.
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
You're saying stay away from him.
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
This is very awkward.
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
Through the closet.
The last time I was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but I guess it beats getting paranoid the next day.  Okay, I'll go first.  I haven't...
I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up.  I'll get you a great tour.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
Uh-huh.
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
Yes, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Righto.
He made a cat.
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
You know it.  I'm out of here.
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
Alright we're clear.
I'm honored to know this man.
Put it in the middle of the room!
Hm.
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
I hope this was made with egg whites!
Is it?  I've forgotten.
Yeah, right outside the door!
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil.  Maybe he started taking it.
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
No man I'm on my own plane.
Didn't you hear him?
What did he say?
Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
Man this is heavy!
Right.  Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
Let's check out the scene.
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Man look at that get up !
Man if this place doesn't cool out I'm gonna hang out somewhere else...
There's that weird dude again.
I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...
Now what kind of statue was that?
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
I wonder what his deal is.
I know, man.
I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
I know, man.
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
I know, man.
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
I know.
Look at that, man.  Big deal.
Not only that, he copied us!
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
I do the research.
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
I want that cat.  I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
I don't!  But fifty thou?  That's not money, that's manna!
Why on Earth should you be so depressed?  Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
It would imply you could not succeed on your ability alone!
I won't say good luck, Walter.
After that we go no more!
Here here!
Suit yourself.
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?
Good morning Walter!
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
Call me...Maxwell.
I saw your...cat.
Yes, get rid of them...
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
Well I'm overjoyed.
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
Let it inspire you.  Maybe it will let you think of me.
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
Then let me give you something then...
I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!
Well, I'll go home with you.
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
It's like...you've turned on.
With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
Your work, the layers of irony.
I get it Walter.  I get it.
What's the matter with you!
Well why don't you clean up this dump!
She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
What's all the noise in here!
Good night Walter...
If you see him.
What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
I look horrible.
Cheer up.  You may still.
I had him in my grasp.
You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
Shut up!  You let him have it!
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
What's wrong with you!?!
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
I don't think this is gold.
Let's move out!
Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
Coach knows what abs are?
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Litter, yeah!
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?
Buffy!  Looking tasty.
Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.
Man has a complex.
Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
Down there.
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
He doesn't look fifty.
Hi, Buffy.
Eeyuu.
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
My mom doesn't go anywhere.  She even does the shopping network. I'm gonna die a virgin.
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
Excellent.
Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss noise.
What's Bobby gonna say?
Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
Buffy, honey?
Do you know what time it is?
I am a God!  A God!
This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
You're even weaker than the others.
What?
Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
Like what?
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.
Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
It is a pretty crucial subject.
'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
Swear to God.
Really?
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.
What... are you?
Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.
My parents have money...
So very much.
What's happening?  What do you want?
I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many.  To feel their souls coursing about me.
You are much more.
I'm just a girl.
But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. Satan.  He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth.  They are a plague upon us.
I don't understand.
The mark of the Coven.
She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.
Why?  Why me?
You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
I can't!
Good.
Got that.
Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
Could be.
You think so?
Could be.
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
Hi, Grueller.
Bessel!  What are you doing here?
She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.
But --
No --
Jeffrey!
Make me a woman!  Yes!  Make me a woman!
Oh, yes!  Yes!
Okay, what else?
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
And Spring Fling.
I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
Probably was.  What do you suppose she was doing out there.
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
Does Jeffrey know?
What is she...
I never thought of that.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
You're kidding.
What happened?
Omniplex?
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
All right.  Take care of yourself.
Ah, you'll be coming back.
No...  You want me to give him a message?
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
You should be at the game.
He's a virgin.
Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
I got lured.
He'll learn.
Ninety-three miles an hour.
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
Ninety-five miles an hour...
What's it say?
Ninety-five miles an hour.
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
God bless you.
Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
Ebby's told me a lot about you.
We gonna fuck or what?
Never heard of 'em.
Who's he play for?
The socks?  It's cold in here.
Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
Well shit, then, let's fuck.
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
Which one of us?
That's what I been telling everybody!  Wanta dance?
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!
No, that is not belief.  That is desperation.
I'm 0 for 16!  Gimme some of that shit.
If you believe in Voodoo.
Will that work for me?
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
You a God damn witch?
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
What's that?
You're outta here!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
I didn't spit on you!
You missed the tag!
Did you call me a cocksucker?
Don't bump me.
You missed him!
Crash, shut the door.
What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
You can keep going to the ballpark and keep gettin' paid to do it.  Beats hell outta working at Sears.
We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
Crash Davis?
Who you calling a "boy"?
She's playing with my mind.
We fight, she gets the clown-- how's that happen?
No way.
Don't try me.
I'd kill ya.
I ain't hitting a man first.
Pussy.
Step outside, pal.
We'll pray anyway.
We'll be praying for you.
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
We're getting married.
Well tell 'em, honey.
You can do anything you want.  Hop in.
Can I give you my testimony?
No.
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?
I put in a word for you with the organization--told 'em I thought you'd make a fine minor league manager someday...Might be an opening at Salem next year--
The organization wants to make a change...now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher...
Check it out.
What the hell's going on out there?
Okay...
Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose.  Anything bothering him?
I'm getting too old for this game.
Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
Eight and sixteen?!  How'd we ever win eight?  Jose, what's this sign?
You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're- way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout.  You know what that makes ya  Lollygaggers.  What's our record, Larry?
Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes--  We want you to mature the kid.
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down
Struck out eighteen...
He walked eighteen?!
Little high.
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
Where's Ebby?
Your breaking ball's getting better but ya need a change up.
Ain't here.
Who ain't?
What'you want, kid?
Don't tell him I told you--he'd break my neck.
Goddamn, that's great!  Jesus!  Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but--  Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown.  To Sandy's...  the whorehouse.
Well, I'd rather not say.
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...
Why are you doing this to me?
I can't believe you're doing this.
What are you talking about?
What?
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
Thank you.
Yes, you were.
You were in the m- You were in the building.
You were wandering around.
You were wandering around.
You were wandering around.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
That's right.
I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
Hi, Ace.
Speeding?
Hold on a second.
Wait, hold on a second.
All right, take care.
Yeah.
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
No, you're not calm.
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
Watch it, partner, watch it!
Excuse me.
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
That's right.
Now this is just a signature card.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Oh, no, please, please.
Mommy.
Dad!
I can't! I'm tied!
Help, Daddy!
Okay.
You bet.
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Hey, it is my pleasure.
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
Hello.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
Good to meet you.
All right, we're clear.
Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
You go and put your things away.
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
Ace, listen to me.
No, Ace.
What can I do?
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
Yeah, refill'd be great.
It's always been our policy -
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
...and she doesn't always -
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
...position...
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
Well, sir, I was just...
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
...and hypocrisy.
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor.  What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam
There was nothing to it.  It was my pleasure.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
...Well, I've got a large family.
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
A record of the arrests...
Look what they did to my hand, man!
God!
Ye-yeah.
Well, I... I never tried.
No, Sir.
No.
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
What?
Thank you.
Yeah.
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
I just wanna get out of here.
Thanks, Nick.
I didn't give 'em the m-
Yeah.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
...I got muscled on the street.
When I left here with the money...
You shut up.
I don't want to go to Europe.
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
You gotta go back out there.
What expenses?
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
Sam?
You can't talk to me like...
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
Well, I've been busy.
Hi. Good.
Yes.
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
Yeah, that works out.
Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where you goin' -
I can't.
Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-
Go get a bag, man.
Jeff, would you go in with her?
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
Please.
I understand.
Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I'm sorry. We've got some complaints about - about the noise.
Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh!
Hey.
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
Okay.
Come on. I'm sorry.
If we let her get a few of her things we'll be out of your hair.
Hey, Mr Rothstein, it'll make it a lot easier on everybody here if we just let her in the house.
Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let her in the house and get a few of her things?  That way she'll get out of here. This is half her house anyway.
All right. Okay, okay.
Hey!
Hey!
...fuckin' jerk-off.
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
Pitch-black?! It -
What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.
You've gotta be kidding me!
Here we go!
Leave me alone!
You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who you're fuckin' with?
Now move along.
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
Yeah?
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
Nicky, I'm sorry.
I did - I didn't -
Nicky, I did -
It's instinctive, you know.
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.
Great!
Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you.
Yeah. Fuck him.
Fuckers!
Is that the last one?
Carmine's gone.
He's not here?
He's gone?
Carmine left?
Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine.
We're waiting on Carmine.
Oh.
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh?
Carmine left?
Oh.
Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?
We can't help him if -
Artie! Artie!
Stay out of the way!
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
Calm down! Calm down!
Artie!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
...same outfit.
Well, you know...
Great.
Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it.
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
Come on!
Yes.
Yes.
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
What's the matter?
Ginger, honey.
I'm sorry.
Thank you. Very nice.
Yes, don't worry.
They checked in alone.
...they're in Penthouse K.
Listen...
Incredible.
Wow.
Hey, how you doin'?
Look, there aren't...  There aren't but...
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
I think that's it.
Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ!
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Two.
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
Charlie M.
Ch-Charlie M!
Fuck you!
My fuckin' head.
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
Yeah.
Well, I'm a little confused here.
You sure?
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
How you doin'?
Hey.
Mr. Chairman -
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Denying?
...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?
Yes, uh...
Hi.
Yeah.
Adonis, be polite. She's a friend.
Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
I'm not going to worry about it. We are quite beyond the computer disc. Everything will be over within the next hour or so.
I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this.
Works for me.
Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody, give it a swat...
Have we reached the epi-center?
It's okay. Let her go.
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
You have to dial nine first.
I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission...
Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
The crowd bought it.
Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..
Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...
Yeah, all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..
You know, nobody likes you...
That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.

Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
This looks promising...
I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...
Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...
Cactus, I can't believe you just said all that...
Catwomen. Lots of them!
God, can you hear me!
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
What about "climbing in?"
Even the skylight?
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
I know, I know, a Warrior. You're very annoying..Now tell me how to defuse the bomb you've set..
Pass!
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
Winning.
Touchy. Look everybody, it's Casper, the friendly crimefighter...
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
Yeah, this is better than rape.
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
What's the catch?
He didn't remember to roll up his window...
"Dat's gotta hurt!"
I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
Absolutely.
Car wash, Captain?
I got her...
Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down, let's chat..
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
I know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
What did you say?
God-damn..
How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
Why am I still troubled...
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
Well. I stand corrected.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
"Well done," Cactus.
What a "drag."
I know.
I loved you.
Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  "Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse...
Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.
Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.
I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore, Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.
What's the matter with you, Spooky, my most trusted comrade?  We are warriors!  These are the challenges we live for!
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning.
You like them, don't you, Boss.
Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.
Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
A bit sadistic, don't you think, Captain...?
Well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it.
Now he'll be up all night...
Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
You can't get away with..
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to "get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed, but really, what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself, anymore.
How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
You've seen me...
You think so?...Selina?
I still have one left...
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
And...your point?
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
Hello, Rachel. I'm Selina.
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
And I...I..want you to know our secrets..
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
For when the time comes..
Men, huh?
I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...
You're not strong. You're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you. Whatever the Cult of Good was, it's not anymore... You don't have to listen to me, just listen to you..
Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring..
Whatever you say...Sis.
I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
Hello, Spooky.
Spear.
Spooky.
Ask me another one--
What's the name of your child's best friend?
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
I'm a good mother!
Did you just say "girls?"
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
Kelly, get to work on those new uniforms.  I'm not running a summer camp here..
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
Hey, you're anti-male.
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up..
Yeah, as in born before..Ooh, I suppose it's "sexual harassment" to give a woman a compliment. Sheesh. Come on, gentleman...
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
You're late. I've got some good news and some good news. I'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in.
Okay, deal.
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
Thanks.
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
I don't see anybody in there but you.
This is one way.
Where do you think you're going?
I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
Matter of fact I did have a kid once.  But he's a lot better off with his father in Milwaukee.
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
Was someone in an accident?
Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
What if they do question the authenticity?
Wake up.  Make a right at Ocean Avenue.  The hotel's a few blocks up on the left.
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
You gotta just look the other way.
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
Will you two cut it out?
Theo wants to talk again.
I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
You couldn't hurt me.  But it's the principle.
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
What was that for?
Who's on the phone?
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
Are you guys all right?
I told you I should've cuffed him.
Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
Can you make him stop!
How do we get back to the freeway?
Any time you decide to let me in on it.
Only I was sloppy.  I let you take me out.  That was quite a humiliation.
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
Yes sir.
You almost brain me and lock me in a fucking trunk and you're on my side?  You stupid fuck!
Lady, don't let him do it!
What's this?
Let's have your license, mister.
Why would I do that?
They'll wait.  Meantime, raise the lid.
Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
You never miss a trick.
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!
You can tell she was really worried about me.
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
Got your badge?
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
<u>You're</u> doing all the talk.
Make a "U" and go back.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye!
What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
That's your "rep."
That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter.
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
You switched license plates?
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
You mustn't hang up.
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
Mind if I have a look?
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Let her tell you.
Hold on.
There's no lady here.
Who are you?
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!
The 405 is coming up.
I thought so.
What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
Government business?
Doesn't everybody?
I already called for an ambulance.
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
Look, I'm sorry.
Don't chuck my clothes out!
Fucking mad!
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Please, Dil --
It's Dave.
Cunt.
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
Cunt.
It's him, isn't it?
Who the fuck is he?
Don't be like that --
You fucking did.
You fucking promised.
C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!
What's that supposed to mean?
Consider it how you like. Just get that bloody tart out of here.
Whatever it is she does for you.
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
No, of course not, she's a lady.
Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
He wants to know do I mean that.
Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as you remember you're not at Lords.
Bloody right I do...
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
Off his wages.
Not in my experience.
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid.
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
Aha.
Do you now.
So what do you need, Fergus?
All right, then. I like to be wise.
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
Fergus!
First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
I'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on I'll be right behind you.
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
No, thank heaven.
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
The last one, please.
No.
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
Next, please.
No.
Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
1944. The next face, please.
He looks so young -- when was this taken?
Very good.
It's Charles!
Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
No.
Yes.
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
Brian.
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
I am a tradesman, Madame, not a doorman. And don't forget these.
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
Forty-five thousand.
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
The money is unimportant.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
The kid said --
What do you mean, no?
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
Meaning what?
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
Not unless we're blind.
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.
You sure nuthin's missin'?
Why bother him?
And if it is?
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
She isn't going to be anybody's mother unless you answer some questions.
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
Mrs. Lampert --
No -- but I will ask.
But he is gone.
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
Up there! It is up there!
We won! We won!
I found it! I found it!
Up there! I would put it up there!
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voil!
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?
Okay.
Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
Oh, la.
Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?
You think on it real careful-like, Miz Lampert -- y'hear?
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?
Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --
Come on now -- sure you do. An' you'd better give it to me, Miz Lampert -- cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob!
You know what I want, Miz Lampert...
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
Shoot no, not after all these years.
He took care of Charlie for us.
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
You do?
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
Why?
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
Yeah?
Ok!
I get the imports.
One more time.
Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
Not my imports.
I get all your CDs.
Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two.
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
I think it's funny.
As fucking if.
If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
I never fucked Rod.
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
Calm down Brent.
That's impossible.
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
So?
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
Hi Jody.
Fine, just don't mention the carving This is going to be a tough enough day as it is.
Good.
You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?
We're seeing all the signs in town.
Should we close down any eruption?
As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight.
We need you here. I can bring her in.
You found her?
The same type that decides to carve into her stomach.
People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.
I can.
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
She resides there. Out back. She died a year and a half ago.
St. Michael's.
She's not here.
Hello?
No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.
Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
Your brother told us.
I know where you're going.
No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
But I shouldn't shut it down?
Ok.
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
Jesus. Any word from Brent?
Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
Who's?
We just found another body.
I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
I'm sure you should have failed.
You gave me a 'D'.
What?
You fucked me up!
What are you doing here?
Pay no attention to me.
You think you're my sister?
Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
He's a rapist. Like mine.
Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
Yes. We have no real freedom. You of all people should understand that. This may sting.
We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.
I really do. For your own safety.
Then you should go.
of COURSE. You're not scared?
You aren't going to the party?
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
You're sweet. I really wish someone had thrown a party like that when I was your age. My life might have been very different.
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Follow me.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
His mother's side.
Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
Are you Jody?
What?
What are you doing?
I guess so. Luckily we won't have that problem.
What?
You ok?
Now don't be nervous.
You're so beautiful.
You can have both if you want.
They're tasty.
Did you want one?
Hi Sandy.
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
Told you to hide it.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
I'm not leaving it here.
You can't bring it.
No.
Hide your laptop here.
Ok.
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
ROD!
Stacy?
Yes. Unfair to me.
Unfair?!
You're being unfair.
Rod!
I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod.
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
That wasn't me ...
If sheep don't count.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
What?
Let me just ask you a serious question first.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
Maybe it won't stay in.
But you don't really mean it.
I said no.

Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.

And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
I can't say it's a surprise.

What's going on, colonel?

All right, let's move...
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
It's not over, Brynner.
He was Major Andrew Bryn-...
Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?
And where are you going?

Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
It must've happened right after we left.
All right.  Enough. Look...
It could be a cover, I suppose.

Of course I do. Where are you?

Hello.
Then what'll you do?
I said okay, Jake.
Okay.
Jake, listen.
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but -
No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
The apple core club.
Thank you...
Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in Long Beach, but we lost it.
I'm not.
Why?
Yes.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
But, Mr. Gittes.
He's in the dark room.
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
It's on your desk. Say, you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins?
I think I got something.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
You'll find one of those people.
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
Oh no.
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
I was the one who pretended to be Mrs. Mulwray, remember?
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.
Ida Sessions.
A Miss Sessions calling.
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Oh, good.
We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
I'm sorry. We don't.
Of course.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
Oh my goodness.
That's what I thought. You see, I'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray. You know, Mr. Mulwray's wife.
Never?
Have we ever met?
Do you know me?
Mr. Gittes?
Comes in different parts of the river. Every night a different part.
When it comes.
The water.
Si.
It's not completely dry.
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
Drowned, too.
That's a long fall.
Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. Only in L.A.
Jake, what're you doin' here?
Sure you do.
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
Gittes?... Gittes?
Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
But I have to know.
But...
...Yes of course.
Of course not.
Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
I'm afraid so.
Mr. Gittes...
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
No problem with me on the Job.
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
Yes.
Yes.
He owned it.
Yes. No.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
He was expecting you?
Since lunch.
May I ask what this is regarding?
He's not in, Mr.?
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
Sue people like that they're liable to be having dinner with the Judge who's trying the suit.
Yeah?
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
So he says you sent them?
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
Yeah.
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing  apple core.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
No, you have a press agent do it.
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money.
She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
That's for sure.
Course, she settled down nicely.
Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?
But that's what you told your wife.
And the next time don't go around saying such heresy. You survived the fire at the movie house. But no one can save you from the fire of Hell!
You understand now? You see it clearly?
But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!
What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!
Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and all the saints help you. But coming back! The saints stand there watching you, that's all! God's will be done.
And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
You shouldn't tell me that now. After all these years!  I put all your things in here. Go in, go in...
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
Then where's the money?
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.
Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I'11 call you...  Toto!...
Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
What the fuck you talking about? You getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!
So what's that got to do with it?
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
We haven't heard from him.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
No, Mr. Kane.
But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.
Yes, Mr. kane.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures.
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
I'm sure that's it.
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him.  But I'd be better off that way -  - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane.
I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane.  If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.  Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson.
I see!
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why don't you -
Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to believe me.  I'd like to show you -
Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only we're talking now about what you are.  That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table.  I'm fighting for my life.  Not just my political life.  My life.  If your husband is elected governor -
I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane, and your husband is just trying to be funny calling me one.  I don't even know what a gentleman is.  You see, my idea of a gentleman, Mrs. Kane - well, if I owned a newspaper and if I didn't like the way somebody else was doing things - some politican, say - I'd fight them with everything I had.  Only I wouldn't show him in a convict suit, with stripes - so his children could see the picture in the paper.  Or his mother.  It's pretty clear - I'm not a gentleman.
She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.
You've made your point perfectly clear, Mr. Kane.  Good day.
I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
Impossible!  Impossible!
I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles.  Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise -  this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year?
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
Oh, yes, sir.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Can't say, sir.
Yes, sir -
Yes, sir.
Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
Yes, sir.
Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
Yes.
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
You won't be lonely, Charles...
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
That's the train with all the lights.
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
I'll sign those papers -
How do you do, Charles?
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
Right here, Mrs. Kane.
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
The Bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final.
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Kane's last words, aren't they, Jerry?  That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, Jerry? Did you ever find out what it means, Jerry?
Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?
I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
I wonder how they put all those pieces together?
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
Yeah, all in crates.
Good!
Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick.  Go after the people that knew Kane well.  That manager of his - the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts -  I don't mean go through the City Directory, of course -
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
Thompson!
All we saw on that screen was a big American -
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
See what I mean?  He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him.  That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything.  I heard him say it. He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor.  He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out.  But I knew how to take care of him.
Yes and no.
That's the whole works, right up to date.
Yeah.  I guess he wasn't very happy those last years - he didn't have much reason to be -
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
Rosebud?
She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
This? How long have you been smoking?
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
He smoked until the day he died. Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way.
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
You think I'm shitting you...
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
How long have you been smoking?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit. You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! For good, cancer-merchant!
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
You're the disturbance, pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
Okay. I'm sorry about that.
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.
This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
How long have you been a smoker?
Do you mind if I drink this here?
Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
I can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. That's when the girl found him.  Something smells like shoe polish.
No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty.
With this guy locked in?
Then who operated the store?
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
Wait a second? Who was working here today?
What time was this?
Shit!
I thought Redding had like three balls!
Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
So?
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
I'm her sister.
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
He's got those love handles.
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
Just the paper.
Are you open?
Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to Big Choice Video instead.
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
You calling me a liar?
It's not like it's a demanding job. I'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV. The other day I walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping.
It stings a little.
Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital.
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
You said you were here all day?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
Here you go.
Can I have your name please?
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
You open?
Did he say "making fuck?"
That doesn't sound metal.
What did he say?
No way!
He only speaks Russian?
No way.
He's your cousin?
Scumbag. What are you doing?
Does he sing in English or Russian?
He really wants to play metal?
Is he staying here?
What part of Russia?
Sure. How about the beach?
That's sick, Dante.
She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm.
Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
To an Asian design major.
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.
That's tight. Solid.
No way!
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
Screw you!
Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
You hope what feels good?
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
I beg your pardon!
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
Well, how about these two movies?
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
You're gonna be at John K's party?
How long you gonna be here?
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
All right, asshole, you're on.
Twenty bucks?
Like hell you are!
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
I have first dibs.
Dental School.
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
I know. I've been here since eleven.
The guy ain't here yet.
Bye.
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
Exactly, cheesehead, exactly.
That woulda been cool.
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
What?
"It's a perfect day for a monster jump."  Hey man, can you like do me a favor?
No way, death-breath, that was too intense for thunder.  C'mon let's rock an' roll.
Did you catch that thunder?
C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Work!  Don't say that word, man.
How yo doin', Gabe!
Gabe!  Hey, man!  Gabe!  It's Gabe!
Cursin'.  That's a penalty kick for unsportsmanlike conduct, mate.
Did I hear somethin' break? Outside left!
Who's shooting?
Ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
More bang for the buck.
Answer the man.
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.
Rooster!  Forget the hen stuff. Be safe, honey.  Over.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
I admit, I can be bought.
Hal will have my head for this.
I don't know.
They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe.
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
What usually eats a banana?
So, what do you see?
Help me!  I don't want to die!
Please -- oh, no -- please!
Six...
Four...five...
Three...
Two...
One...
I'm sorry for all the trouble... Thank you.
Can I count as fast as I like?
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
Okay--I don't know about this.
Is it really four thousand?
Fine, I guess...
Hi, Gabe.
Now you get burned.
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
Do you always transport through the air?
I don't know about totally.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
Mostly.  Armored cars can be hijacked.  Trains can be derailed.  But nobody can get to us in flight.
Appreciate it.
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
Rich...
Cut the shit, sonny, and get out of here before you get yourself in some very serious trouble. He rocks the giant phallus which has a special weight swinging inside causing it to swing up and down an eccentric motion.
No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
Well, shall we get down to it?
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Hullo.
So this is the young man?
Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son?
Alex.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
You've not been to school all week, son.
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
It will be your own torture. I hope to God it will torture you to madness.
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer, yes.
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.
Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee.
Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
Ah, Alex boy, awake at last, yes? I met your mother on the way to work, yes? She gave me the key. She said something about a pain somewhere... hence not at school , yes?
Well done, Frank. Julian, get the car, will you please?
Do you still feel suicidal?
Do you feel that way now?
I beg your pardon?
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
It's alright, thank you.
The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
Not tonight - not this nochy.
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Well, we go round shop crasting and the like, coming out with a pitiful rookerful of money each.
All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way.
We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.
There, there mother, it's alright. He doesn't mean it. You were in the papers again, son. It said they had done great wrong to you. It said how the Government drove you to try and do yourself in... and when you think about it, son... maybe it was our fault too in a way... your home's your home when it's all said and done, son. Em sobs.
Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
Oh, aye, aye.
Aye.
Aye. Glad to see you back, lad.
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
Fine, fine.
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
You wanna be sick?
You're gonna be sick are you?
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
What do I want?
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
I'm sure it won't be long now.
It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
Good. I'm glad
Yes.
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
Good. What do you want?
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
Yes?
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Just part of hospital routine.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
How are you feeling today?
No, no, boy. You really must leave it to us, but be cheerful about it. In less than a fortnight now, you'll be a free man.
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
You're not cured yet, my boy.
You're keen on music?
What's all this about sin?
Very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. One of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death, a sense of stifling and drowning, and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees. Alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket.
They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money.
It's a stinking world because there's no law and order any more. It's a stinking world because it lets the young get onto the old like you done. It's no world for an old man any more. What sort of a world is it at all? Men on the moon and men spinning around the earth and there's not no attention paid to earthly law and order no more. The Tramp starts singing again.
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
Mothballs, sir.
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
Carry on, Chief.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
Are you feeling better?
Hullo, son, how are you?
Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son?
D'you think we should do something?
Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
Aye. You should have let us know, lad, not that we're not very pleased to see you again. All cured too, eh?
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
Shall we go to my office?
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
Four in this block, sir.
You sure?  You look pretty shaky...
You dizzy?  You want to sit down?
Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
This vehicle's not safe to drive. We're gonna have to impound it.  Get you towed.  Step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk.  I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to find another cab.
You still carrying passengers?
A deer?
This your current address?
Very generous.
Twenty five?
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
Can you finish on schedule?
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Federal?
What?  What did you say?
What?
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
Neither do I.  But my children, they're still young.  Do you know who they like even more than jolly old Saint Nicholas?  His helper, Black Peter. An old Russian fairy tale tells of how Santa got so busy looking after all the good kids, he had to hire a helper to punish all the bad kids.  That was Black Peter's job.  He was given the list of all the bad children, and he would visit them in their homes late at night.  And if he caught them not saying their prayers, he would leave a bundle of wooden switches outside their door.  That was a warning.  If they continued to misbehave, he would swoop down and take the children away. And they would never be seen again.
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
Sorry?
I see.  That was an important list, wouldn't you say?  The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  And you "lost" it?
Take him down.  Save Richard Yip, our witness...
What are you gonna do?
I don't know...
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
So?
...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
Can you fax me his picture?  His license or something?  What do you mean you don't have that there?  Anybody else in the cab?
Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that...
Something going on?
This isn't our goddamn game!
...if they're wrong?!
Not our call, Phil.
What if they're wrong?
Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
Pick me up in five minutes.
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
Jesus.  Two in one night?
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
Elvis?
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Cabbie had no criminal record, no history of mental illness.  Suddenly, he just wigs out and pops three people, then himself?  Plus the victims weren't random solid citizens. They were all lowlives.  Wiseguys.  I've always wondered if there was someone else in the cab.
Oh?
I never bought that.
So?  It was a random thing.
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
What thing?
Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?
He could'a been depressed.  It still doesn't tell me homicide.
There was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it.  Ivan flew out the window and went bam.
What homicide?  Phil.  Where's a body? Look.  All we got is glass...
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
You guys been holding hands?
Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.
...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?
Try?
What's your name?
Of course I'm proud.  You know he started with nothing?  Look at him today.  Playing concerts.
Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Oh, call me Ida.  To what do we owe the pleasure?
Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?
Vincent.  It was nice to meet you. Visit again?
Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
What's he sayin'?
You paid for my flowers?  They're beautiful.  Max, you gonna introduce us?
By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
What am I gonna do with flowers?
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
I've been calling and calling.
...show me the wallet, man, get your ass up, <u>up</u>...
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
Yo, whassup?
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
Who is this?
Maaaaaax!
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
I was just tryin' to...to...
Let's not get excited, sir.
Who the hell is this?
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!
Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.
I give a shit whose fault it was, you're payin'!
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
...why is everything always about you...
All I know is, they said to send you and the body to the basement.
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
They said send you downstairs.
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
Just drop me off.
Drop me off here!
You turned up a one way street!
Are you crazy?!
Why the hell not?
She must be some girl.
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Geronimo?
Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
Excuse me?
Shut the hell up.
Sure was.  Pounded the V.C. for this Greek cat named Ari Onasis.
Saved you last night's, too.
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
What're you thinking, Jerry?
Liza, settle a bet for us.
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
Night after that?
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
So, you doing anything tonight?
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
Yes.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
What the hell does that mean?
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
Ah, your psychotic is here.
There is no abort procedure -- we don't know how we turned the damn thing on, let alone how to turn it off.
There's no plug to pull.
We've lost contact.
We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?
All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
Dr. Arroway, do you think it's possible you had some kind of... delusional episode.
He died...  ... in 1972.
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
What in the hell...?
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
Dr. Arroway, let me first say --
Dr. Arroway --
So... there wasn't any clothes in the machine.  She was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the Maytag. Listening.
Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
What's the status of the decryption effort?
Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.
A transport.  So are they coming or are we going?
How soon will you be able to decode it?
What does it say?
I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
No primer.
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.
That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
Got a bogey, boss?
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
Can't we get rid of them?
It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
Never seen the optical sky myself, but I hear it's nice too.
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
Here, right around Centaurus A.
1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
Please answer the question, Doctor.
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
Is that your official response?
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
And a hundred mile airspace.
Colonel Jarrod, I'd like a twenty mile radio-silent perimeter put around this installation immediately.
You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
I think it is your naivete I like best about you, Eleanor.  Oh, there'll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew it from the very beginning.  You Americans discovered the signal, you led the decryption effort.  The machine is being built on your home soil... Of course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans.  Anyway, it is what the whole world wants, no?  This is the big show. The sort you put on better than anyone.  It's good marketing.  It's good casting.  It's the American way.
I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
Have your department make a full report.
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
Recommendations?
... as have all attempts at internal analysis.  We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable.
That's it, Mike.  Last time I checked, I was still running the country.  Although it seems that for the moment, Dr. Arroway is running the planet.
But --
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
What is it?
Oh my God...
Cut that backsass!
But I made this arrangement --
Git movin', I said.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
Git your shovel and git to work.
Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
I got two years.
I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.
I'll make it a dollar.
We work down in the ditch?
It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
We saw the broads.
He's probably a gigolo.
A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?
You steal a car?
Tell us about it.
Ram it in and break it off!
Go hard!
Sure he's got kings but you still gotta call him.
Gotta have kings.
Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
Lookit her bounce.
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke.
Go git it, Luke.
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
You got your mind right, Luke?
Git to work!
What's all this dirt in the yard?
You don't know!
Then how come it ain't done yet?
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
She's got him! You hear that?
Here's the Patrol.
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.
Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Borrowin'.
You can't do that!
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
I did three hitches in the Navy. It ain't bad. After a while, you get used to it and the time --
-- went down to see this old hag and she had needles the size of that cane.
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
I'll give you fifty cents.
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
That fool. That damn fool.
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
Forty-five.
Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
You just said he could eat anything.
Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
I gotta believe. Out!  Now they're rollin'.  King-five-four gets an eight.  Pair'a nines with a Jack gets a four. Ninas still up.
Call.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
Ana paira ninas. Koko's the brains.
Gettin' up, Carr.
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
No. No chains either.
He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
He'll never make it.
Oh for...
Stop that.
One, two, three...
This is a big day for the guards. They get to remind us who's boss.
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
Fear of what...
What did I do?
I hate this...
None of your fucking business.
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
When was that?
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
What pattern was that?
You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
What day is this?  In jail you lose track.  This week.  Friday.
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.
I don't have it...
Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
You get me out first.
I never carried a gun!
I never hurt nobody...
I was?  How you spell that?
Who are you?
She don't want it.
She's supposed to have it.
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
The door was already open...
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
Where is it?
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
You come and visit.
Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you?  That son of a gun...!
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
You know how to use this?
I know, baby.  I know.
Open the door.  Please.
They all have one...
Yes.
<u>What</u>?...
Yes.  I have to go...
I'll get a locksmith.
Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
Tell me what to do!
The problem for me is... you're in the witness category.  Know what I mean?
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
Not yet.
We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...
Let me get a little action started here.
He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  I'll drive you down...
Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
Just get out of your vehicle...
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone.  I know you won't mention it.
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
Who prescribes the brandy?
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.
We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?
Hello.  I am  Meryhew Saks.  The song is called "Murder By Numbers."  The performers are a group called The Police.  Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note.  This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers.  We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims.  We have a team sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want to say a few word to you local people.  Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.  The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year.  We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy.  Together we can be unbeatable.  Which one is Inspector Halloran?
Lieutenant  Quinn.
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
No.  I didn't.
Michael Johnson.
I was.
Don't ever forget how good you are.
I heard. Good police work.
Who gives a fuck?  In all the years I never seen you cry.  You loved him.
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
You're shitting ion your career.  You outrank hi...
It's none of my business anymore...
Working late.  You're a damn fool.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
Talk to Nikko...!
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
What's Abba?
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
Look at him, grandstanding...
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
Spread out like she was sexually assaulted here.
She's blue as hell.  No marks on her neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same -- no ligature marks.  Outdoors...
Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at this...
She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails.  I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
Is Niccoletti <u>assigned</u> here?
Absolutely.
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
I like women like that!
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
What's wrong with him?
You came in there with this attitude...
Classy madonna.
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct?
What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
... third Bay Area woman has been strangled, but the police continue to deny that this is the work of one killer.  Lt. Thomas Quinn declares that the murders will be treated as unrelated crimes, unless new evidence...
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
We were together six years, sir!
He's not treating her right...
That's what I don't know.  Why would you lie?  That's the problem... I can't understand why anyone would lie.
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?
You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself.  Where're you?
Put in the Kevin Costner.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
What does he want from you?
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
Can you drive?
Are you still involving me in your crash?
I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.
I'm sure the police would make an exception in your case.
Are we allowed to park here?
I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project.
You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
The case could be made.
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
It's something we're all intimately involved in: The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
It's not the police. It's the Department of Transport. Internal politics. It's a joke. They have no idea who we really are
Crash victim?
I'm glad.
You can only do what feels best to you now.
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
I understand you just got engaged. Maybe that's where we should start.
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
Green spot.
Sounds awful. I guess we better check it out.
Yeah?
Letty, you should be in bed.
Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
Or, of course, you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year.
I need someone to work on budget projections.
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
I'm glad you're doing well.
I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
All tapped out.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
No. I have it. The lamp? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it?  Remember?
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
A pass.
Where are the tapes?
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
Agent Hadley.
Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.
We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet. We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week with a copy. It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they're not going to be very happy when they find out about it.
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
You'll never get out of the city.
I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago.  All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris.
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
What?   This?
Hey man, you can't do that!
I dunno.
Where did they go?
They left about a half hour ago.
Not today.   Where are your friends?
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
Take what you've got and get out of there.
You've already robbed the safe?
My number's going to show up on his bill!
You're calling me on is phone?
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
You're there now?
Marcel?
Who?
Hello?
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
Hello?
I don't trust anyone. You don't get to the top of this game by trusting people... and after all, you are a thief. It's in your nature to steal. I'm just protecting my investment.
This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow.
Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.
Good.   I have a job for you in America.
Hey Daniel! Hello?  Do you guys speak English?
Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
Yeah -- you do that.
I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
Why are you here?
I'm not here to negotiate.
Okay.   How much?
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
-- Super what?
Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
I'm good.   Really.
You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
No thank you.
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Good.   I'm good.
Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?
We're doing everything we can to find these people. Right Tony?
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
Yes.
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.
Why didn't you tell me about this?
Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
But you were there?
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
He missed three weeks.
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you.
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
Uh, no --
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
Someone else coming?
Good word.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
They're gonna be what?
I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
And?
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
No, I'm good, Angelo.
Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
You have something for me?
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
Where are you staying?
I only have your word for that.
And the other half?
And for my help I would get what?
You want me to help you get out of the country?
I assume you want something?
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
I'm just setting my boundaries.
I'm not any closer than you are.
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Why not just steal another one?
She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.
Yeah.   We just go home.
No problem.
You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
And the Vodka.
What about the money?
You want Zero to kill him?
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.
And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
No one? Then why is Zero here?
Where are you from?
That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
What for?
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
I thought they came with batteries.
Do they come with batteries?
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
Hard to say.
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
I just thought that--
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
Maybe you should call the police.
Great fuckin' song.
Good song though.
Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
Oh, I'm sorry.
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
Okay boss.
Just find them!
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
Okay boss.   Where are they?
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
Boy, you must be pissed.
Everything.
Everything?
Everything.
What'd they take?
Yeah, French guys from France.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
They were all French guys.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
Hey boss, it's not a science.
That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So, I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate.
You said don't do it, boss.
What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?
Go look.
I don't know.     I didn't look.
What room number?
The Holiday Hotel.
What hotel?
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
And the other car?
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
What'd you guys find?
Go where?   The police are outside.
What do we do?
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
What about transportation?
I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --
Okay.    I will have a beer.
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
I see.   A master criminal.
What is it you do, Sami?
We both know I'm already dead.
I'm not going to leave you.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
I knew I should have driven.
This is the only American car you've ever driven.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
I've never driven a Cadillac before.
I'm the driver.
I'll drive.
Relax. It will be fine.
I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar.
She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
What are we going to do, take a taxi?
I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
I see. Well, get back out on the street and find them before I "sort of" kill you.
They sort of got away.
What happened?
Just tell me who's closer to the wall?
Get in the car.
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
I said a clean break.
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
How's my brother?
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
Fuck you, grease-ball!
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
The hell it is.
No.   It's mine.
Yeah.   It's mine.
Anybody know about that car outside?
The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
No shit?
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
Yeah.
You see that car?
How?
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
Uh huh.
Mr. Zammito?
Cool.
I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
I know where she went.
How are we going to do that?
Although a cartoon I feel he shares a universal theme: We are all searching for love. No?
Yeah, I dig him.
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
No thank you.
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
Glenmorangie is very good.
J&amp;B?
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
The money isn't here.
How do we know what room she's in?
What?
I think we went the wrong way.
Watch this.
Feel free to correct him if you want.
They killed our friend. It's personal now. Besides, if we do that, then Julien died for nothing. The tapes are the key.
And how do we do that?
We don't know that for sure.
What does arresting us get them?
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.
-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
And you don't speak French?
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
Okay.    Okay.
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
It's for you.
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
A car.
What's this?
What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that.
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
A little?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
She seems pleasant enough.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
-- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine.  Break his arm.
Frankie, I --
Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.
I'll go and make up his room!
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
You're back!
Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.  My wife was quite a martial arts expert.  Jade Fox killed her.  So you see, this is personal.  Leave her to me.
Then leave her to me.
Yes.
This Jade Fox is a woman?
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
Why were you spying on the Yus?
I don't care about your sword.
Wait!  I'm a friend!
Who are you?
And if I use them to kill you?
Why do you want to teach me?
Go ahead.
On guard!
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
Do you think you are a real master?
What's it to you?
I do as I please.
Let's go!
I'm just playing around.
What's it to you?
Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you!
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
Yes, you do!  You are still my disciple.
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
You're already a thief.
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
You're home late... or should I say early?
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
You don't seem to understand.
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
Hello.  What is your name?
This spells trouble.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Jen...
I will.
You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
It is trouble for me.
Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there, circling closer.
I am a man.  And now I've found the brightest star of all.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
I don't take orders from anyone.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
Still in a bad mood?  At least you're speaking.  What's your name?
You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
You're tired.  You need rest.  Your horse needs water.  There's a creek up here.
Let's stop a moment.
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
Jen!
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
A female criminal!  Now that's news!
A murderer?
But don't be too lenient.
That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
I heard Sir Te lost something.  And now Madame Te's not feeling well...
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.
Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
"We'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill."  Good, the fox is out of her hole.
What does it say?
They're gone.
Father!
You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.
We must avenge mother!
It's Jade Fox!
What do you have in mind?
This is a delicate matter.
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
All right.  I'll act as the sword's custodian.
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
What in the hell... do you call that?
And you're gonna tell me who.
Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
They make you fart.
No onions though, okay?
You buying?
Talent. Hi.
Don't thank me.
You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know.
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
It can't rain all the time.
At least it finally stopped raining.
We'll discuss this later. Obviously.  You left the door open.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
I lost my key.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
Mom --?
Not me.
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
It's just the dope, don't worry
Fun -- look at that guy...
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
Out.  Now.  I gotta work.
Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
You're not gonna come back, are you?
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
And she'll be alive.  Up here.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
What's going on...?
You gotta go now, I bet.
Do you feel okay.
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
He has a room, upstairs.  I don't like him very much.
Mister Funboy.
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
You look like a rock star without a job.
Oh.
Mom tried to cook.
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
She's still dead.
Well, how's your friend?
I went to see a friend of mine.
What's goin' on, Elly?
I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
You buying?  He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention.
Right.
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
I'd like to get in touch with him.
I don't know you.
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
I don't know you...
Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
Little early from trick-or-treat, homie.  This dick trying to bushwack me.
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
That's ancient history.
Take the dope, too.
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
Top Dollar.
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
I took yours from you.  Your little girlfriend?  I took hers, too.  Your meaningless, petty life?  I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  You're no avenger. You're mine.
I don't believe that. Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief.
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
I know.  That is why I will prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?
I wish to possess what you have now.
Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts!  What the shit are you gonna do about this?!
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
How the hell did you do that?
Very well, it's your ass.
You'll be alone.
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
Your job is done.  You interfere with the living again.
Maybe I was wrong about you.
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
You work for the dead.  Forget that, and you can forget it all.
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
Get it?
Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion.
Miss her?
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Interested?  Follow the crow.
Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
Leather purse...
Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
...necklace... pearls...
18k.  Crap.
Coupla more rings... 24k.
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
Move in, guys.
No shooting.
I've got him if you want him.
Is he inside?
We've got company.
Kill a dead guy?
Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me.
Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
That thing is poisonous.
This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
What... the hell is that?
No.  I saw a guitar.  This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood.
Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
Your comprehension is not required.  Your cooperation and, indeed, your ability are the issues on the table.
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
The night is young.
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
"Our" Crow...?
Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
To be sure.  Now tell how your friend died.
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
Who got himself what?
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
An unexpected pleasure.
Doesn't ring a bell.
Schwarz. Jewish?
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
I'm sorry about that.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
Absolutely.
Well, I guess it's getting late. Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway.
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
I don't know. He was just so charming. All he did was talk about how I had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them. Things just got out of hand from there.  Mom? Are you there? Mom?  Mother!!!!
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
You don't know him. I'm so stupid.
He told me he loved me and I believed him.
Hi, mom.
Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
Racist piece of shit.
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
I'll be right there.
What do you mean?
What's wrong?
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
Yeah?
Hello.
But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
Pleased to meet you.
It's the least I can do.
Let me get that for you.
Absolutely.
I can't thank you enough.
Black.
Ronald? That's crazy.
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
What about her?
Not at all. What's wrong?
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
That's beautiful.
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
I guess that puts me in my place. Thank you for the hospitality Mrs. Caldwell. It was a true awakening.
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
Is that so?
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Excuse me.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
I understand. Good night.
I'll do that.
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
She's out.
She's not here.
What do you want?
I'll do that.
I've already told you, she's not home.
You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.
Oh... no thank you...
Excuse me?
I did?
We played backgammon?
I did?
Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
Don't worry about it.
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
Nope.
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
You bastard!
Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile.
Did you hit her?
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
How will I get to her?
She really loves me.
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
Once the emptiness in Amy's life is filled, the dream will go of itself. If a up to you, both of you. Only you two can bring her into a real world.. You must give her the friendship and love she craves.
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
What do you mean?
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
But quite harmless, I'm sure.
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
I know how it is.  My Dad collects miniature canon.
Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
I'd love to.
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
Maybe I'll drop in and see your Mommy.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
Hello, Amy.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
What'd you get for Christmas?
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
You'd better hurry.  I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient.  She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
Looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over. Was there surgery involved?
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
Can we get some service here?
Waiter! She needs more water.
Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
Wow your body's really hot.
Your lips look delicious.
Yeah but they looked cool...
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
Yeah that's like a three bagger. Today a bag is also a condom, so now a three bagger can be a chick that's really hot. So hot you gotta put several condoms on to dull the senses.
No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
Don't apologize. It's great to see a woman really enjoying her food. I hate it when I buy a woman dinner and she won't even touch it.
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
How have you been feeling?
That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
How's the rest of your health?
A dog at Victoria's Secret?
I mean where on your body?
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
No it's mom.
Very well then. Is that all?
No?
Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
Did you change your hair?
Coffee and...
Script coverage?
The Nielson's?
You use the word "fucking." You're sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It's okay to have sex.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
Oh, I see... interesting theory.
You can't believe this bullshit.
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
It's for you. Frida.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
She's just so... pathetic.
He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
Yeah, Im like that.  Senility says the wife.  But she sure cant complain.  Heh.  The erector set still works good.  And this aint no fucking rug! Ghead.  Feel it!  All mine!
Not really...
Mnunn.  Cold lately.  That night, couple weeks ago.  That was <u>real</u> cold.  Remember that?
Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
What of?
Sell maps?
Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
Thanks.  Just some pills.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
I need something to keep me awake.
Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.
How will we interrogate them?
They don't speak English...
No one available.
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
His wife.
The other one?
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
I <u>know</u> it's his doctor...  I need the file on..  Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
What's he doing here?
Spinning backwards?
Maybe ten minutes...  Thats strange.
How long have you been here?
Was that for real down there?
What is this place?
Just like that?
I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
Doctor!  What brings you here?
Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...
Police.  Nobody move.
Yes, sir.
Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
How could you have been so stupid?
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
I see...
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
Lost something?
Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me...
Ill be the judge of that.  Anything else?
Its extremely important to my investigation...
A hunch.  He might be able to...
Why do you want to speak to him?
Shes getting better, thanks.  She...
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnt with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, hows your mother?
What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnt this his case?
I see.  One things for sure, hes ambitious. Youll be a busy man from now on.
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Yes.  This way.
Good evening, sir.
All the important stuff.  Wrap it up for me.
Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
Put it through...
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
Who is it?
Well be more careful, please.
Why, yes.
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Im sorry...
How can I submit this?
<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
It seems fine.
Wrong?  Look at this!
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
You typed this report?
Fine.
You wont regret this, sir.
Good.
Ive taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsons office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
I didnt requisition a secretary.
Im your new assistant.
Patricia Crenshaw.
Dont ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Sorry, sir.
Dammit!
This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
What now?
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
Where do you think this goes?
Why, that's ridiculous.  You just...
Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
Go on.
That's right.  Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  No mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it that way.  Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory.  That's not all.  Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event.  Then I would turn the lights off.  Sit down in a comfortable chair...  And study each detail of this subject.
What?
They didn't have faces.
Don't know much, do you?
Don't know that either.
Why are they after you?
I don't know who they are.
Who?
People...  after me.
I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
Why give yourself up?
Shut-up.
Where are we going?
A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, I can't remember.  Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again...  Now, please leave me alone.
But...  How long has this been happening?
No...  No doctor...
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
What is going on?
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
What?  Who has?
They've taken my mind, my memories...
Not that.  Anything else.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
Can't let you in...  sorry.
It must be a closet or something.
Where does it lead?
Yes.
You see it?
No.  Have a look.
Such a joker!  Like your father.
There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?
Which one?
What is that door?
Look!  This is a good one!
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
I didn't realise...
Wait, this isn't fair...
I see.  The verdict, yes...
But I...
A book of delusions.  Anything else?
Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.
A fanciful idea, Mister White.
Please...
Shut up!
Dont kill me!
Just let me sit here for a moment? Ill go soon, and stop bothering you.
I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed?
No.  I mean...  that isnt necessary.
Then we must call the police.
Someones after me.
You seem restless.
No.  I, ah...
What is it?
What happened to you?
What are you hiding?
It's a trick.
Why?
You've been working too hard.
Not that again...
So you're telling me the truth <u>this</u> time?  Is that it!
You're a liar!
I have to go...
I'm sorry.  About before.
Can I get my life back?
I'm nothing then.
Horrible...
Did she drown?  The woman you told me about?
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
Known me for long?
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
Yes.
That's what people keep telling me.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
You know something about me?
That's easy.  You...
How do I get there?  Tell me.
They're dead, John.
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
How do you know I'm innocent?
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
Yes, but I wouldn't...
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
And it's proving quite effective...
Yes, Mr. President?
How'd you get started?
My wife was my campaign manager. We had a two thousand dollar budget.
One day my wife says to me 'Why don't you try running for office.  You talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?'  So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break.  Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.
What?
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
What do you mean?
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
Fertility beads.
And these are a gift from the King of To go.
This is from the people of Burundi...
Fabulous.
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
Who's this priest I'm thanking?
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
What about the intro?
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
The Monroe?
Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
Then why did you come here?
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him.
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
Please....shoot me.
Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.
Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please.
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?
It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
His madness....could be from shock.
Leave him.
Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.
You'd hold us back. We have to go on.
Oh, yes. Quiet. Yes. We must be quiet.
Quiet!
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did.
Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look real bad.
The tunnel.
What is it?
You'll find the ways, Miss Mary. And when ya do...we'll sail on over to the mainland...or any other damn mainland fer that matter...and start us a recruitin' program. There's millions o' Bees out there jus' waitin' fer' a General ta lead 'em on ta vict'ry!
It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy.
Tonight?
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.
SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP!
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
Sir. It's quite clear that...
MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!!
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
Miss Henried, I think you better...
Well, you managed ta make it here jus' in time fer this case, didn't ya?
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'.
The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived!
No. You won't be able to do it. He will rise. He will rise and you... you will die.
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours.
No. The disease was cut away from me. I will live. I will live.
You are dying, too.
He is dying. He knows it.
...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
NOOOOOOOOO!
I detest all my sins...because... because of Thy just punishment... because of Thy...just...punish...
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee...
PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
TONY....TONY....
I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead place. Like all the others.
Dios mia.
Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
No, Miss Science. You're the one who needs to do some thinking.
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
Rhodes, you and I had a roll in the hay together when I first got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying experience which I do not want to, and which I never will repeat! So give up, mister! I'm going home...to that roommate you mentioned.
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
Oh, I have no doubt.
Julie Grant is a behaviouralist. She's not medical. She hasn't been as...exposed to...to things...as some of the rest of us. She'll be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be alright.
And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!
You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.
They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
No wonder they're so....hungry.
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
God....damn you, Rhodes!
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
It's because of me.
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
It's been fired.
Let me see your weapon.
You fired that shot, didn't you?
Step up here, Tyler.
I said, I'll take care of them. Just leave them there. Go help with the rest of the gear.
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
Where are you going, Tyler?
I'm alright. Let's go.
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.
To fucking Mutt.
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
Hell no, I'm not afraid of them just, if we get caught with them, we're dead.
They're townies?!
Do they go to Henley Hall?
I'm in as long as we're careful.
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
You know how many demerits we're talking?
Sounds boring to me.
Garden?
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
All right.  I'll try anything once.
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
Well, welcome to "Hell"ton.
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
Oh God, it's over now!
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
Well...
This is better than sex any day.  This is romance!
Don't stop.
Nuwanda?  Please?
Please!    It's so wonderful to be appreciated for my mind!
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
You know what really excites me about you?
I think he's sweet.
That's right, it's Nuwanda.
Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
Isn't he precious?
It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?
If I find that there are others, Mr. Dalton, they will be expelled and you will remain enrolled.  Stand up.
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?
Mr. Dalton, if you think you're the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think again.  Others have had similar actions and they have failed just as surely as you will fail.  Bend over and grab your shins.
Who else was involved in this?
what?!
Good.  We're very excited about him.  He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know.
Your family move into that new house, Mr. Overstreet?
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?
You fucked up little prick!
What are you doing?!
Stop what?
It does?  What?
Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
It's not all right.  Come on, Dad
That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
"We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life." Anybody want to read?
Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
Oh, Captain, My Captain. Is there poetry in math?
The hoi polloi.  Doesn't it mean the herd?
Meeks.
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
At these boys' age? Not on your life! Tradition, John.  Discipline.  Prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself.
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
All right!  What'd she say?
Nuwanda recited poetry to Gloria and she jumped all over him... right, Nuwanda?
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
You have another choice.
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
Too bad.
Good luck.
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
Any group pictures in the annual?
I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  It's just a bunch of people trying to impress Nolan.
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
I'm sorry, Neil.
What is it?
What is this, a midnight study group?
That's miles.
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Weird.
They are...they are everywhere.
We're going to die here! We're going to die!
He's the owner...
We have to make it to the third deck...
Yes.
And what? These things are octopusses?
What the hell are you talking about?
I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here!
We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
Shut up, man, just shut the hell up! I gotta think! I gotta think!!
Shut up! You hear me!!
Hanover!! Hanover!!
Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
So?
You ain't giving the orders here!
I'm looking...
What is it man?
I'm not screwing around with you man...I hate the cold water.
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
Check it out!
Hey! Come out here!
Someone's back there.
Nothing.
What was that?
Plans don't change...
Maybe plans changed...
I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
Like Mamooli's country...
What the hell does that mean?
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
There ain't no thing here!! No thing!! There's you him and me!! Got it! You him and...
What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo?
'Cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head...
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
Shut up!
You know what Sal's got now?... Sal's got... one arm, Nick, and... that's it.
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?
He doesn't want people bugging him, Nick!
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
Sure. Why not.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
You're back.
Merle is under his tree... Beside the terrace. You can't miss him.
You are his friend.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
You are frightened, no?
But I insist.
But you must come in.
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
You call me Linda, just like home.
You like to call me Linda now?
I show you. Come. You come.  Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right?
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
Everybody love Linda.
Too bad.
Get anything?
How was huntin'?
She's in back.
Now he's back.
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Boy, do I love this conflict. Huh?... What the hell were you doin' in there?
Not bad fresh, but they don't keep worth a pig's fart.
Those fuckin' niggers. This time I'm going to eat balls!... You ever try 'em?
I will not betray my country. No. Ne-ver!
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.
Biederman, yes.
Here.
How extremely clever. That is really most extraordinaire... Allow me please to introduce myself. I am Armand... And you are?
And then you...
Playing?
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
You seem... disturbed.
Sure. Sure, Sal. We're going home.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Sal!  Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?
Right here.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Right here.
Merle?
Merle, I wanna go home!
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
This is horrible!
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
I want to go home, Merle.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
No. No, no.
You can do it, Sal.
Who the hell knows!
Who the hell is he?
I like it, Nick.
How's Linda?
Sit down.
Nick!... I thought you went home.
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
Three bullets -- minimum.
Nick... NICK!!! It's the only chance we've got!
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
We gotta play with more bullets.
LISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD TOO!
Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
Forget Sal.
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
I thought you might be praying.
What are you, hoping?
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
Yeah... I mean so he knows... He doesn't even know.
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
Hey, Nick?
It's ahead, by the tree.
Promise! You gotta promise!
I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that.
Yeah.
You think we'll ever come back?
Hell no!
Oh.
Pow?
What'd he say?
Fucking A. See that ribbon in the left. That's Quan Son. That fucking guy was at Quan Son!
Nick, he just came back.
Yeah.  When it comes to hunting, that's true.
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
What do you think about?
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
Fucking A.
So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
You think about it?
You do?
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
I just wait. You know?
That way it sets.
You should have put that on last night.
Right.
There's Vince!
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
You gotta learn, Vince! You come out here... You got no jacket, you got no pants, you got no knife and you got no boots. You think everyone's gonna take care of you! That's what you always think, but this time you're wrong. This time you're on your own!
That's it. No. No way.
No.
No.
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
Watch it, shithead!
How much? How much do you wanna bet?
You wanna bet?
Yeah!
No.
Phantom Mary?
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
Merle gave me this?
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
Maybe you could use socks, Nick. Jesus, I mean, come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now.
Where?
You didn't get a deer?
Did you get one?
Did you go hunting.
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
I gotta get back, Nick.
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
Listen, Nick --
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
What?
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
See you Monday.
That's my plan.
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
Right.
You guys are crazy. You know that? I mean you guys are really nuts.
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
There's Albert!  Hey, Albert!!!
Up.
Up a little there... What would you say?
Down ribbon!
Down.
Down I would say... What would you say?
Up ribbon!
Up.
Up I would say... What would you say?
Wade did a little reminiscing.
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
Wade's here.
Yeah?
I want this bastard brought down.
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
I can smell it.
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
Technothugs?
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
What'cha got, Bennett?
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
Mom, I hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting.  If you've forgotten, they're called 'men'.  Sometimes referred to in more colorful language.
Kimberly!
I think he wants more than your cookies.
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
I'd think about it.
What did you say?
Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
Put that on your political resume.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Speak up.
Your mother.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
Fuck you - fuck you.
Funny guy.
No, you're not model material.  Anything else?
I want to ask you a few questions.
Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?
My man Dubbs.
Avon Lady!
Who is it?
You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  I was iced.  What better way to keep me from talking.  Stop me if I'm wrong.
I don't want to hear anymore.
<u>You</u> were the dirty cop... and I was on to you.  You panicked.  Afraid I was going to expose you... so you shut me up.
You're crazy.
You were planning to send me back to the ice house.  You set me up.
What are you talking about?
That wasn't your plan, was it?
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
We have to talk.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
Not anymore.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
I'm wasting time.
Where?
Just got the call.  Took him from school.  Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.
Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
Remember my promise.
This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
And I want Doucet.
I want to stop aging.
Ah, fuck you, Wade.  This is bull- shit.  You're not going to kill me.  You're not going to risk your freedom.
I'm not voting for you.
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
I'll be alright.
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
Out of the room.
Hello Wade.
I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
You're working a partner on this.
I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
When you bring in Doucet.
Give it to me.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
No, but he's going to be by tomorrow. He's aging.  'Bout the entire twenty years lost while being frozen in forty-eight hours.  In that time he'll be an old man.  Could be a year, an hour, or all at once. Called NPA Syndrome.  Natural Pro- gression of Aging.  It affects each individual differently.  I'm sure it's painful.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
Mug sheets.
Fill it out.  Standard issue mal- practice insurance.  All Cops carry it.
What's this?
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
I want to see my wife and kid.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
I'm not on the force anymore.
Jury found you guilty, not me.  I just called it as I saw it.  Fuck that.  You were brought here for a reason.  Doucet's escaped.  Re-animated for his parole hearing.  Killed a lot of people.  Most of them cops.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
Shucks, and I got all dressed up.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
What the hell are you talking about?
Sir, your transmission's fading.
I'm thrilled beyond belief.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
You two fucks listen up.  Doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit Technothugs.
Forget it.  Stick to the program.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
Kill him... kill him.
He could be brought back.
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
I don't want any press on this.  I've got an election to win day after to- morrow.
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
Just great.
Telephone repairman.
Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
Shut up!  Drop it.
Sir---
Keep 'em busy.
Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go.
Aces.
How do I look?
You okay?
Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.
Sir, your limo's here.
I've also drafted a letter to families of officers killed in the line of duty.  They'll need your signature.
Fine.
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
Ooops, I forgot.
Not the 'T' word.
Maybe I should put on the training whe---
Go in the house.
Nobody's looking.
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
You sure?  I can help you.
I got it.  I got it.
Need help?
And you should be with your family.
You should be in hospital.
No you don't.
No.  I want to be with you.
I'm signing off.
You be careful.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
I just heard.
If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.
What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
Hospital food.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
You okay?
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
Yeah.
Not yet.
...Have you been drinking?
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
...What are you talking about...?
You treat her nice.
I'm here.
Sanchez...?
We're partners, aren't we?
What's this?
Not too good.
How do I look?
How ya feeling?
Rip Van Winkle.
<u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
Simulated one.
Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
Fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
What else did he get?
Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
No, sir.
You're not pregnant, are you?
No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
Wanna try?
You're just afraid to use this.  You have technophobia, Wade.  That's what you got.
With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
Then find me some cigarettes.
Yes, sir.
You want to be a good detective?
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
Hey, I'm eating.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
I'll have a cup of coffee?
Good night.
Good night, Wade.
I'll be okay.
You need anything else?
Thanks.
She's pretty.
Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
Yeah.
This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago.  Thought maybe he'd come back.
What's this place?
Yeah.  Least I think so.  Twenty- six years this March.
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
Married?
Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
I was set up.
Why?
Drop it.
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.
How then?
You can't catch this man with a computer.
NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  That's when we'll get him.
Relax, let technology do the work.
Hey, buddy...
Trust me.  You don't want to know.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
Bacon cheeseburgers.
Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about?
When you're frozen, you're legally dead, right?
Yes.
Can I ask you something?
Pass.
Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
My insurance won't cover it.
Wanna come?
I'm not fond of television comedies.
You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
I'll inform dispatch.
Some things never change.
How do you know?
They're going to rob that bank.
Technothugs.
See those guys?
Doucet killed my partner.
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
I have to go home, Sanchez.
Lean year for role models.
Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
Got it.  Ejection seat?
You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
Does it drive itself, too?
Give me a break, Sanchez.  It's like riding a bike.
But Sergeant...
I'm ready.
Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
I drive.
Well, that's good enough for me.
Yes.
Are you a cop?
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
You my partner?
Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
They always are.
But he was such a good cop.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
Take a look at this.
You never want to find out.
What's it mean?
Demolition Man.
Says here one of our boys brought him down.  You ever heard of a badge named Wade?
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
This is the guy that killed my partner.
Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
Remember, get the seat fixed.
Bye.  Thanks.
Good to know you, Willy.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
What's your name?
I'm going to be a policeman.
My granddad was a policeman.
Yes.
My mom says I'm gonna grow.
Seat's too high.
Yeah.
You all right?
I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
You could always take it off.
This little thing says I can't.
Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
Haven't seen you around.  Where have you been all my life, handsome?
Hi.
Hi.
They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
Jabez! Careful --
The people, Jabez -- the people.
Of course I will.
We will --
No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --
No -- that's for me to do.
Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
You know that you're in my house.
You're lying.
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
Belle --
You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --
Say ... about the interest ...
Thanks, Jabez -- I really wouldn't need very much ... if you could let me have some seed to start off with enough for spring planting ...
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Howdy, Jabez.
We'll be mighty glad to have you with us.
Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.
Yes, it's the debt and the lien and the mortgage that eats up the farmer!
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
Loan shark -- hey?
Belle.
But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.
No. She's gone.
I do -- and I think you should too.
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
But what becomes of our souls?
-- of what happens after we die!
You are afraid!
Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
Where's everybody?
Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late.
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
Mornin', Jabez ...
Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
No, Stone!
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
Why not -- ?
You are not so sure that he'll come.
Well -- yes --
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
You want me to go around --
The only one you missed -- is the President.
Yes.
Dan'l Webster?
Why of course --
Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for Selectman.
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
Oh!
Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
Morning, Jabez.
Coming along, Jabez?
Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee --
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
Just someone from New Hampshire!
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
I can't be honest with them.
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
I want someone to talk to ...
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
I wanted to give it all to the church.
We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!
If he's not a terrorist, and he's not a hostage...he's just not part of the equation.
One of yours?
Not any more.
I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.
Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns.  I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk?
What are you going to do?
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
Where are you going?
Tell that to Mr. Takagi.
His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
How about his job?
John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
John.
The police...?
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
What's happening?
John, how can you say that, after all these years--?  John?  John?
What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television...
John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...
Tell me about it.
I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?  I can give him to you.
Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
'Asian Dawn Movement?'
I don't want neutral...I want dead --
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing.
Hans, he killed by brother --
And if he alters it...?						*
He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.
Nothing...
I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
The only thing left for them is the City Grid...  ...They may not do it.
When you're hot, you're hot.
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
Three down, four to go --
Yo!
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
I told you...
After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.
Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
You did.  You murdered by Boss.  Now...  They're looking to me.  Personally I'd pass on the jab.  I don't enjoy being this close to you.
I...have a request.
John!
I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --
You want to know my idea of a marriage? It's a partnership where people help each other over the rough spots -- console each other when there's a down...and when there's an up, well, hell, a little Goddamn applause or an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.  I needed that, John.  I deserved that.
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
...I've missed you.						*
I would too. * They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other.
Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
Oh...Where does he live?
That's okay...  ... I have an eye on his private bathroom.
What are you doing?
Sure.  Follow me.
You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks.
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
Holly Gennero?
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.
Don't let 'em off the ground.
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
Gene, Jesus, what a bull he is!
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
Gene -- you smilin'?
You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
Aw, hey...
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
I was lookin' at it.  I saw you, man!  Jesus!  You oughta see yourself!  You wouldn't believe it.
Jesus, you're the man!
Yeah.
Listen, it's late already when I realize it's not just a couple of ordinary faggots, it's just you and Sal.  I couldn't get a baby sitter.
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?
...because you hurt me, God how you hurt me.  Can you imagine, marrying another man?  Did I do something to make you do that?  Did I ever turn you down, or anything?  The only thing I couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top - I got this fear of high places!  And I let myself get fat.
See?  You're screaming with the language and all!  A person can't communicate with you.  You become a stranger in your own home...
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry...
Well, how'll I get home?
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.
I love you.
I'll kiss the baby for you.
Oh, yeah, I will...
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
What guns?
Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  The bottles are in the fridge.
It looks like a whole roast.
He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
Jenny?
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
You know, Sonny, I used to dope a lot, and I was into dipping?  And I did a couple bank jobs, and the Lord Jesus in his everlasting mercy saved me, you know how?
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
I'm glad it's okay.
Okay.
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
You all right?
Everything's all right?  You okay?
Hey.  It's raining.
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him.
I told you, he's got diabetes.
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
Howard!
No, that's all.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
Yeah.
Did you always call him Junior.
No, not until after they killed him.
Did you know he was a homosexual?
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
When was the last time you saw Sal?
It was on the TV.
How did you know your son was involved?
Yes...
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
You're serious!
My body?  What for?
For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
Pure?
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
You stopped?  Why?
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
Here's your document, Sonny.
Sonny - Here's your document.
They're beautiful ...
He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
I forgot she's in here.
Oh - Maria!
It's not a joke.  I got this terrible fear of being locked in...
Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet.
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.

A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
I can assure you...
LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
Yes.
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
Yes.
I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Yes?... How was your journey?
We have just folded space from Ix...
That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.
Yes, Sire.
Sire!
Basically...
The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
Play out your little comedy while you can off-worlders...
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
So, this is Leto the Just...
This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me, please, my Lord.
My Lord?
They said you were dead.  They said...
Paul!!  Paul!!
Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one.
We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.
Not sorry enough.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.
I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.
No, but many consider my training valuable.
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death.  It's a maker...
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
Do you know this my lady?
That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham.  I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin.
As the legend says.
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
You know the ancient tongues?
Stop him yourself.
Man-carved steps.
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
Yes...
I can't... I can't.
I'm ready.
...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...
He knows.
Is he....?
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
Where are we do you think?
Excellent!
Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
Your Reverence.
Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!
Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world.
To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
Always.
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
That it is.  He shall know your ways as if born to them.
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
You've worn a stillsuit before?
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
Long live the fighters!
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
The Water of Life.
Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...
You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us....  We welcome you.
We call that one Muad'dib.
You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
We have our new army.  Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
Those sounds could be imitated.
"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
Oh, tract housing, huh?  I guess I shouldn't complain about my duplex in Burbank.  What a dump. Some places have a Murphy bed, this place has a Murphy <u>shower</u>.  I still don't know where to hang the towels!
Say, that's a funny place to sleep.
Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.
I predict we're lost.
YES!  My father ran a mortuary -- it's an old habit!
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
Ah, cheer up!   Don't lose heart over what happened tonight.  I predict that your next project will be an outstanding success!
Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>!  It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!
You mean a Tesla coil?
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
Yes!  I've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I've got to take action.  GOODBYE, PENIS!
WRONG!  I'm getting my first series of hormone shots!  And once those babies kick in, they're gonna remove my organs, and MAKE ME A WOMAN!
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
I mean I can't see the difference. I'm color-blind.  But I like the dark gray one.
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
Rolling.
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
Rolling.
This is kind of a stream--
These shoes are itchy.
Nothin'!  I told him he was great.
You really think so?
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
My pleasure.  I'm always happy to assist in a little larceny.
Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
Eddie, we're in show biz!  It's all about razzle-dazzle.  Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything.
There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
I made it up.  It's horseshit!
I guessed.
I'm Criswell.  I know all.
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
And who may you be?
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
We'll do our best.
Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
What other sixty-thousand?
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
Eddie, which dress do you like better?
Hmm.  Those sound kind of small.  Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her.
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
Yes.  Hollywood is oh so exciting.
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
He's a <u>bum</u>.
Hey big shot, get off your ass.  They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
Lugosi's washed-up.  What else you got?
Oh, "Dr. Acula."  I get it.  I don't like it.
Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
I can't wait to take a look.  So what's up next?
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Really?!  Well good for you.
So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
Wood?  Ward?  Wood.  Hey, what do you know.  It <u>is</u> Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one.  Right?
Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you.
It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.
My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
Yes?
What's uncanny?
Exactly.  Hey, how 'bout this -- what if I don't have any lines?  I'll do the part mute!
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
The <u>Ghoul's Wife</u>?!  God, I can't believe I'm doing this...
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
Look buddy, I'm a big star.  I've got real offers from real studios.  I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.  So forget it!
Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat --
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
Yes?
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.
So how long have you known Eddie?
Hey, don't blame me!  You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling!
What octopus motor?
You're <u>sure</u>???
You're sure this is gonna work?
Ed, you said you were getting permission.
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
Well my cousin Fred met this dame from back East.  She's from "old money," and he thinks she's loaded. And here's the kicker: She's <u>very</u> <u>interested</u> in the picture business!
Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.
Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.
I don't know.
Lines around the block.
B-but it's our money --
Mr. Wood?  <u>What do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?!
I thought this was a group effort.
This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
Mr. Wood!
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
No you're not!  This marriage was never consummated.  I'm getting an annulment!
What the heck is THIS?!!
Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
Wow.
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
Why... yes.
Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
Isn't that the same thing?
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
Oh.  Yeah.  You.
Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
Who?
Vampira!  Hi, this is Ed Wood.
You know it.
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
If Ray would steal this girl from Ed. That would be great.
What?
You know what would be great?
She doesn't give a shit about him.
You think she really likes him?
So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.
So?
This is real, Bananahead!
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
Okay, I'm nuts.
You're nuts.
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
What?
Did you see that?
Where are you going?
Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
I'm not sure about the entire concept.
This guy.
No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
Who?
I ... don't know. I ...
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.

Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
Mr. Pekurny.
She wouldn't tell me.
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
She won't.
She left.
No.
Hi, Mom.
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
What are you doing?
Our foibles, our foibles!
They're gonna mock our foibles.
Never would be plenty.
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
No, I mean...
Welcome to work, Ed.
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
I batted!
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
Who's Shari?
Ray, where do you keep the glasses?
Do you still have it?
What...
Ed... I'm sorry.
I need help. How many times if just one little thing that I needed would've happened, it would've changed everything. If I had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or... the tumblers just never clicked for me.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
Check forging.
No. Two times.
I was in jail.
Quite a shithole, isn't it?
Who is it?
You don't recognize me.
Hello.
Yeah. Why?
Ed?
Good?
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Are you busy tomorrow night?
We have to stop meeting like this.
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  I'd better get a cab.
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
Hi.
That girl's an idiot.
What does that have to do with... ?
How?
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
pierde.
El/ella -
pierdes.
Tu
pierdo.
Yo --
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
You're not just jealous, are you?  I mean, we both used to talk about her
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
Here, get down.
And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness.
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
What kind of person?
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
What?
You guys have fun?
How'd it go?
Do it!
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
Anything wrong?
So nice
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.
Dick.
Having a problem with your eye there?
You're going to Catholic school next year.  You're going to Sacred Heart. Maybe they'll straighten you out!
Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
What?
Dick... Dick,..
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
But, Mr. M. -
I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
Yeah?
Mr. M.?
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
Okay.  Yeah.  We know
You have the key, Mr. McAllister.
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that.  Right, Jim?
Even tried you at home.  We've got a situation here.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Yeah... whatever.  All I know is she's a troublemaker.  She's on my list.
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
Okay, Jim. I understand.
Walt needs to see you.
Uh, Jim?
I have proof.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
Door was open.
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
This weekend.
I did it.
I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
Okay.  Because I know who did it.  So.. I'll just be outside.
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?
Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
Oh, okay.  Yeah, sorry.
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.
I also like bananas.
No, wait -- apples.  Apples.
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
And she's super-nice
Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
What do you mean?
Yeah.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
Larry, you just take it easy
You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --
I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
If you say so.
And 290 "disregards," right?
Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
No way I It doesn't make sense.
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
Well, I do.
I don't care.
But other people can see them too.
I know.
These are private -- these are for us.
So?
People can see this.
What?
Are you crazy?
I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.
What...?
I'm not like you.
Where 're you going?
I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
What?
Oh, no, hey.  Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she...
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just --
I don't know.  You're her brother you should know.
For what?
I mean at you.
For what?
She's doing this to get back at me
It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.
We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?
Sorry.
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*
Sure, Tracy.
You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time.  She was always super- nice to me.
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Thanks!
Hell, good luck!
Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?
Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
What do you mean?
Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy
Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
Now could you leave me alone?
Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.
I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -
Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
What do you want?
You know how they say one day a big meteor might come and crash into the Earth and kill everybody? Well, I think that would be a good thing.
What'd I do?
You dumbshit!
So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --
Paul, get out!
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
Don't you fucking knock?
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
Till 19-fucking-70.
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
What's it to you?
It's confidential, Bud.  Like that magazines Vincennes scams for. <u>Hush-Hush</u>.  I'll see you tomorrow.  And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it.
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
Was it... a rat?
I came home that night and there was blood on the floor.  Susan said Stams -- Stens had cut himself.  They were acting nervous.  And that Stens kept going under the house.
Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!
No!  Please leave!
That's him.  That's him.
Maybe.  I don't know.
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
Let my daughter rest in peace.
I don't know.  I swear it!
Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
More's gonna cost you.
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
Should I?
What do you want, <u>officer</u>?
Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>?
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
Yeah, so...
What do you mean?
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
Susan Lefferts.
You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous?  I can't think of anything.
What do you want to know?
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
And I'll promote you.  You'll be a lieutenant immediately.
I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?
I don't have time.  I have --
Someone must've pulled the records.
Nothing.
More or less.
I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean.
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
Say what?
I don't own no shotguns.
Man, what're you saying?
Dogs got no reason to live.
You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.
Believed what?
I never truck with no sissies!
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
Say what and so what.
Some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who?!  Maybe we should ask Hedda Hopper!
Gone.  Not a trace.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
Nobody.  At least not yet.
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
They shot him in his library.
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
Of his penis, sir?
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.
Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice.
Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
I'm not going to dignify youwith answers.  If you'll excuse me, I've got a Jack Vincennes press conference to prepare for.
Do you have any proof?
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
On what evidence?
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
My daughter was a virgin!
All he found were rodents.  No signs of foul play.  So there.
A sweet man.
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
Let my Susie rest in peace!
At Christmas.  We had fought.  I didn't like her boyfriend.  I -- she has a birthmark on her hip.
It seems like my Susan, but...
Please hold, Sergeant...
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
Pacific Coast Bell.
Showbiz.
And no one'll know about this?
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.
Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party, right?
Was it a party?
Have we met before?
Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
Oh?  Anyplace else?
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.
Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
What'd he give to you?
What'd he say to you?
And you were the last one to talk to him.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
They found him yesterday folded neatly in a car trunk. What about Zavitz?
DePinto's dead.
What happened?
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
You're not.
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
I don't know what that means.
Be careful, Danny.
I'll come straight there.
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
I'm doing a transfer now.
When can you get it here?
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
Who else have you told?
Clear as day.
You've got it on tape?
Do it!
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Turn on CNN.
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
Listen--
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Listen to me--
Zavitz, what? You want your old job back?
Yes.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
A direct one.
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
It is?
They want to hold you in Contempt for ethics violations.
We've also been informed that the Grand Jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs.
The thing is...it really can't wait.
It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
Is Jerry Delsano in?
Neil, thank you for your help.
With what?
Oh my God.
Are you sure about this?
Law enforcement?
What are you saying?
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
Well then who can?
--Don't think it could've gone any better. Tell me, how's Deb? How're my grandchildren?
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
Is it okay?
Hi, Mr. Dean.
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
Why?
<u>What's</u> your point.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
Yes sir.
I thought maybe it might be for Rachel Banks.
For your wife?
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
Was he with anyone?
Anything at all?
Did he give you anything?
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
Than why can't you tell me.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
You tell me.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
About the accident.
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
A police report.
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
Your stuff?
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
You did good.
Who?
I'm sorry about Rachel.
It's really over?
Is it over?
They're saying you killed that policeman.
Are you sure you're safe?
What is it?
I was missing you.
The lingerie.
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
I <u>told</u> you they could do this. I <u>told</u> you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just another--
Good.
Does that hurt?
What happened to your head?
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
Just reporters.
Yes.
My father's put me in touch with an attorney. He'll be--
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
Was that doctored-up, too?
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
Leave this house.
I think you should leave now, Robert.
Oh, please--
The date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. Is that where you and Rachel conduct business.
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
You <u>swore</u>!
"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
"Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
Robert--
How could you let me find out like this?
He's got his priorities?
I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.
Sorry.
Have you been working with Rachel?
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
Who did you work with to get the--
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
Bobby?
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
I'm sorry.
What do you mean?
What?
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
You should take this seriously.
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
Bobby!
Listen to him.
This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.
Sir?
Maybe it's not connected yet.
I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
You don't know who the fuck--
That ain't me.
Why the hell would I--
Is this a fuckin' joke?
What can I do for you?
And then what?
Oh.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
We'd rather not--
--otherwise we may have to--
We'd rather not--
--otherwise we may have to--
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
We believe he did.
Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
Seat 74.
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
Gimme the shoe.
Your shoe.
Shut the fuck up.
Bobby--
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
Who would do that?
Gentlemen--
What's his name?
Robert--
They claim you helped create a shell company for Sam Vollotti in Zurich and that through your continuing relationship, the Gambino family's been able to exert influence and provide false witnesses to discredit our case.
I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
Merry Christmas, son.
And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
Mr. Dean--
Why would the Union--
I don't under--
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
Well that's why I'm here, Mr. Dean. 'Cause you're a labor lawyer.
Because she's reading the newspaper, you asshole.
She can't talk to you right now.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Robert--
Are you still in Crystal City?
How can I reach you?
I need help.
Yeah.
Bobby--
You think there was a connection to--
Was Zavitz in trouble?
What does that have to do with you?
Yeah.
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
Because we, and our associates, have paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to shyster lawyers like you, <u>because</u> of shyster lawyers like you, and we'd just as soon sit back and sip a beer while you get ass-banged by as many people as possible.
Yes. But we can't.
Well we'd sure like to help you.
What is it you want?
Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.
Yes sir.
It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
We're not gonna hand you and your band of lunatics the keys to the kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in Congress and write a law that allows the NSA to point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well feel like. And the next time you have something to say to me, we do it above-board, in my office, like everyone else. Now get outa my car, I've got a committee meeting on the hill.
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
I said fuck you.
Fuck you.
You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
What the hell does it mean?
The door was open, sir. I just need a signature.
How'd you get in the building?
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
Federal Express?
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
Yes?
I don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. It's ending at your doorstep.
It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
He's carrying the damn <u>flag</u>.
You have any idea what kind of position this--
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
We're not stupid, Reynolds.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
No.
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
Puffed cheese?
Sorry, what's your point?
It's Geoffrey under this.
Have you seen Katharine?
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
Appropriate?
You too.  Good luck!
Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.
A broken car?
I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
Almsy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
If I could just see some identification.
Do you have your papers, sir?
I see.
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
Good morning!
That's your name innit?  Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
Shut-up!
Thank you.
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
Okay.
Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
Or was it Toronto?
Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
You are a Canadian spy working for the Allies.  Code-name Moose.
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
Is this you?
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
David Caravaggio.
Marzipan!  I think you've got marzipan in your hair.  No wonder you're homesick.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
Right.
Lady H said she thought you might be -
Darling, I just heard.  You poor sausage, are you all right?
But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft
Well, she is!
I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
The team is in mourning, darling.
Off with his head!
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
To arm-twisting.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
Apprentices.
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
I love you.
Hana, I know you do!
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.
No.  He's - no.
Third Canadian Fusiliers.
He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself.
And what if he really is a spy?
It's not safe here.  The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us.  Hana -
It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
Pardon me?
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Only we have to go to work.
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
A toddler
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
Hello miss.
I'm feeling old.
I had a hotel room.
A bit of one.
We can do that when we're very, very old.
I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.
Whoa - give me a chance!
Yessir.
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.
Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops.
I'll come with you.
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
Katharine!
Then you were married?
This was your garden?
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
Why?  Are you German?
What about your rank or serial number?
Gin, really.
Always in a rush.
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
Don't use language with me --
Where've you been?
Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you don't know how to do your job by now, I am not about to do it for you.
That's a joke, right?
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
Hey, excellent.  Thanks.
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
All of 'em?
Who?
Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
It's those files you asked for.
Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
He's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there.
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
Tony Marvin.
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
So you say.
So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
There's more than one?
Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your ex-husband helping out?
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
I think we should makes some changes.
I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --
Good.
Who's the judge?
How many counts?
When'd they file the demur?
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
Well.  There were a few documents that I somehow didn't get around to shredding.  That I kept instead.
Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.
That's right.
There was a lot of dull stuff -- vacation schedules, the like.  But then there were a few memos about the holding ponds.  The water in them.  They had readings from test wells, stuff like that.
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.
You're married.
Pattee?  That your middle name?
Heck, yeah.  Come on back.  Just gonna need you to sign in here --
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
You come to the right place.
Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?
Ross.
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
Have you been to the water board?
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer.
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
What kind of chromium is it?
I don't know.
It happens all the time.
Yeah.  A real moron.
I'm gonna hate it.
I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
Mommy, can I get a flower?
How come you're not eating?
Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
In the conference --
Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick day.
Hey, just so long as you see Him.
You've been reading for hours.
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
She's one of the sick people?
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
I'm gonna go live with George.
Randy's mom said yes right away.
When?
Can I play roller hockey?
Yeah.
Well I hate it.
Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
Annabelle Daniels.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And listen, good work.  They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar.
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
I'm embarrassed.
You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something.
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
Have you been logging on?
<u>Excuse me</u>?
Yes.  It's called accountability.
There may be jobs where you can disappear for days at a time, but this isn't one of them.  Here, if you don't do the work, you don't get to stay.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
What do I look like, Erin?  A library?
Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other.  I just figured it was something in the genes.  And you know how it is -- you don't like to ask about things like that ...
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
I know.  It's an awful lot.
There's something else, too.
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
Next week.
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
You did?
Well, from what this stuff says, I'd say they both have some form of cancer.
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  Shanna and Ashley?
Of course!  Oh, gosh, of course --
Oh.  Oh.
He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
Yes?
And code the signal to my private chamber.
Yes, My Lord.
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
The Emperor?
It was .... the Emperor ....
Yes, My Lord.  We'll find them.
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
Soon, Lord Vader.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
Come in, Admiral.
My lord.
The boy is our last hope.
Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
He'll learn.
He can do it.
We've discussed this before.
He will learn patience.
Only a fully trained Jedi Knight, with The Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path ... as Vader did ... you will become an agent of evil ... and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate, despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
But you cannot control it.  This is a dangerous time for you, Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
... Luke, you must not go.
Luke ... you are the only hope.
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
You must survive, Luke.
You must.  Luke, look at me!
Howls.
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
Barks a blue streak.
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
Growls a reserved greeting.
Barks a doleful farewell.
Barks his concern.
Barks at Han.
Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
Barks and growls at his boss.
Barks his agreement.
Barks his consternation.
Howls.
Barks his right on!
Barks his agreement.
Barks at his master.
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
Of course, yes.  But now eat we must.  Good food, I have good food.  Come, come.
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
Mine, mine.
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
The temperature is dropping too fast.
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
Yes sir!
He will join us or die, My Master.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
Our destruction?  Who?
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
I have felt it.
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
What is thy bidding, My Master?
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
It can wait.
Sir, I was wondering ...
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
She is looking for Master Luke, and assumed he would be here with you.  No one seems to know ...
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.
Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
Not yet.  They're working on it now.
Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter.  It's not much, but ...
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
Rather touchy, aren't they.
Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
Oh my, no!
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
Closer?!
If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.
All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
That won't be necessary.
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.
And I too.
The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
I want that ship.
It won't get through the blockade.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
Yes, My Lord.
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
The Hoth System?
What d'you mean, pretending? They are dressing.  Where'd they get those clothes?
They're...pretending to dress.
Excuse me.  I didn't mean to disturb....  What am I saying?
They suggested oranges.
Good God.
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
Did you call the Zoo?
That primitive apes can talk.
Believe what?
Nobody's going to believe it.
My name is Lewis -- Lewis Dixon .
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
Do you have a name?
We know that.
So am I.  And I mean you no harm.
A display of primitive apparatus --
And we can watch ...
To a lot of psychiatric small talk --
I did not call her mad.  I merely asked her if she was.  And I repeat the question.  Are you mad?
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
Zira, are you mad?
And Earth will be destroyed -- just as we saw it.  Only, since fleeing it, we have passed through a....backward disturbance in time -- did you notice the Date Meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship? -- and we have returned to Earth almost two thousand years before its destruction.  That is another reason for keeping silence.  Our human captors would not be edified to know that, one day, their world will crack like an egg and fry to a cinder, because of an Ape war of aggression.
But we saw Earth destroyed.
In some fashion -- and I lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from Earth's future into Earth's past.
Keep him in cold storage till the reports in.  Then send him to Taxidermy.  He's a museum piece.
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
We shall want a full autopsy ...
Yes, but don't take any chances.
They look pretty docile.
Go easy, Stevie.
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
What are they doing here?
I don't believe it.
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
With food?
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
What, Lewis?
I like you.
Please
May I say something personal?
I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.
Primitive?
I'm a psychiatrist.
Humans?
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
I mean he's of your race. He's an Ape.  Look.  You don't have to be afraid.  We've put him in chains and under sedation. Do you understand that?
He's a gorilla.
But he isn't us.  He's your own kind.
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
His reactor's starting to overheat.
Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
Yes...
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
I tried...
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
Cuervo...?
Go on now. Do as I say.
Ooww!
Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
Who's that?
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
Where's Plissken?
What?
Where?
You told me he was dead.
Give it.
Give it to me.
Where is he?
We'll see.
My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
Shit.
I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
Can you land?
Somebody get off!
See you in hell, Snake.
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
I don't know, sounds thin to me.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
Dream on, blue eye.
I see your point. What's the favor?
All right, so I made another deal.
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
Not anymore.
What's in it for me?
You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
Does he know how to activate it?
So where's Plissken?
I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there.
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
What're you doing in here?
Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way.
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man.
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
Down that way.
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
Run, Snake...They're coming.
No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
What are you gonna do in Venice?
It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
The freeway.
I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
Snake - what is it?
Sewers. Come on.
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
You need help.
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake.
Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
Give me the prototype.
Thank God.
You're running out of time.
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
All of us?
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
Who ain't?
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur cannot be lost. Other men--
...I saw nothing.
I cannot--
...Perceval!
He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
He can be no other.
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...
Perceval, you have returned!
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
And you are the great King? The lords have rebelled. Invaders attack the coasts. Crops don't grow. There is nothing but plague and hunger in the land. Only I am feared. I will be king. You may have lost Excalibur, but I have found my own weapon of power. There.
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
Father...
He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.
I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you.
You freed it, son?
Well hurry then, and get it.
I have kept it.
I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
And if he cannot be found, no other knight will champion me, though you beseeched each and every one of them. Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy?
And you cannot love me...
Why can't you be my champion?
Not you, my husband?
No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.
Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too.
No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week.
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
--I'm pretty good at stitchery. I've sewn my father's wounds more than once.
It didn't hurt too much, did it?
You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
Because you and the land are one.
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
You, my lord.
Who does it serve?
We are to blame.
He has given up.
--Nothing!
Love demands it.
To me? But why?
Me?
Who?!
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
Why?
The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
Twenty days!? The world is that big?
I will run.
You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
I am the desert, where water disappears--
You provoke me, Merlin.
Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
You are truly magnificent!
Why?
People make you laugh?
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
A lovestruck page!
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
Can it truly be used for magic?
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
To kill and be king, is that all?
The oath. You didn't say--
I?
Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
I swear it.
I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--
Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
One land, one king! That is my peace!
I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?
Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
Fuck it.
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Well what's wrong?
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
Ten maybe twelve years ago, in Africa. The exorcism supposedly lasted for months. I heard it damn near killed him.
I didn't know that.
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
No, he's working on another book.
What's he doing there? Teaching?
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
How about Lankaster Merrin.
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
You're convinced that it's genuine.
It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
I'm sorry.
It's-
Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
A man to see you.
Excuse me Miss?
No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
She is going to be well?
Bastard! I will kill you.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
There is nothing.
Yes, I go now.
No. No rats.
But it's clean?
Rats?
Good morning Madame.
Yes, I think so.
Fine thank you.
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
Okay.
That's good.
Listen, I don't need any encouragement, but my idea of heaven is a solid white night club, with me as the head liner, for all eternity and they love me.
Hi Chris. Great party.
That's his office back of St. Mike's. He's our psychiatric counsellor. He had a pretty rough knock last night poor guy, his mother passed away. She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.
Damien Karras.
St. Mike's.
What we missed in the EEG and the arteriogram could conceivably turn up there. At the least, it would eliminate certain other possibilities.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
Goodnight Dims.
No, I tell fortunes by reading the crease, now shut up and go to sleep.
Think you can sleep?
There was nothing you could do. Lye down. C'mon.
College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big temptation.
I stole it.
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
No.
I've seen it.
Who's in it?
What's playing.
Sure.
Good bye.
She seemed fine.
You just missed them.
Lieutenant?
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
Merrin! Merrin!
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
Tseirp a si eh! Eno on ma I! Eno on ma I! Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!
What's that?
Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
La plume de ma tante.
Bon Jour.
Ego te abslovo.
In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
In time.
Uh Huh.
You and us.
It would bring us together.
Intensely.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it.
In here. With us.
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
I'm not Regan.
You might loosen the straps then.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
Dimmy, you worry for something?
Okay
No.
Last month.
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.
I'm all right.
You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!
Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
Fuck him!!!
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
Bastards! Stop!
Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras, you faithless slime!
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
MERRIN!!!!!!!
Just a minute.
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
Are you a relative?
Yes
Do you have an appointment?
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Yes?
Miss?
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
Why not?
If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?
Is it Captain Howdy?
Who is it?
Is there someone inside you?
How old are you?
Are you comfortable Regan?
No.
Give me the keys.
It's our goddamn car!
It's my goddamn car!
You're not going to drive!
Give me the keys!
You're not going to drive.
Give me the keys.
It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
It's all there.  Both nights.
We don't need you, Frankie.
Take it now.
Your pay.
Mondays.
Yeah, come on in.
Frankie.
Suit yourself.
We have some lotion.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
Swimming trunks.
Frank.
Honey ...
Honey ...
You bring trunks, Jack?
I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
No bones.
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
They gotta go.
Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Let's get him up here.
What's wrong with them?
What's our friend's problem?
Beasley.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
The fire.  The way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.
Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.
Oh.
Two at a time?
Oh.  What do you do?
You the magician?
Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ...
Oh no!
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
Oh my God ...
Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
My pleasure.
What's the gig?
Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack.
Out.
All right.
All right.
Just call me a cab.
No, no.  You boys are tired.
A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
Spur of the moment.
What am I gonna do?  Put a record player out there?  Bad, Frankie.  Bad.
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
So she's got a few sniffles.
Sick?  How sick?
Well ... thanks.  Bye.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
Actually, that's my stage name.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
Susie.  Susie Diamond.
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
You find a girl?
So run a little longer.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
How should I take it?
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
This is show business?
My watch is broken, too.
What about me?
What do you mean?
This where the auditions are?
Is that important?
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched onto.  She a local?
I'll call you.
I'll call you.
Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
Will I see you again?
Funny hours.
How come?
Whatcha doin' over there?
Right.  In there.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
Right.  Bring him back.
Barker.  Jock Barker?
You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
All right. they lay the dead ones out in the cold room.  I'll take a look.
Save it.  What's he look like?
All right.  Hold on.
You want to know if he's okay. Right?
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
Regular hours are eight to five.
Yes.  I supposed you still have that old phone booth.
You miss him, don't you?
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
Is that the way it is?
And you don't?
It went well tonight.
I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
He's got blood in his eye.
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
None?
Big piece or little?
Oh, fine.
So. How are you?
John.  It's good to see you.
He hit a guard.
They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
Fine work, Jon.
You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
Five.  No one knows you're his father.  I thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you.
Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
Of course he is ...  -- He's yours too.
Should be.  It's yours.
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.
My place.
The last time I took orders from you I ended up with five years probation.
Jesus Christ, Castor.
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
"Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up.
For what?
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
Only one you've never broken.
After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
A few blanks?  Like what?
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
Let me have a look.
You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?
Shut up.
You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
This is it, Jon.  For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own.
Now what?
Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ...
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
You said it, Jon, not me.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her?  When was the last time you two had sex?
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
Or what?  You'll have me fired?
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
You'll what?
So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.
You mean like ... condoms?
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
Like you know anything about it.
When did you start smoking?
Clarissa left those here.
Janie?
The Admiral?
You've got someone in your office.
You always call me Miss Brewster.
Kim?
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
Commander, what are you doing here?
What happened?
Castor's escaped!
You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
Like I fucking care?  I'm not just sitting here!
What about me?
No problem.
Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
Eight pocket stingers ... seven piper uzis ... six cobra carbines ...  five - net - launch-ers ...
I'm just having some fun.
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
You merciless bastard!
Okay, then.  I leave it in your able hands.
I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
Jon, you're starting to remind me -- of me.  Congratulations.
You'd have to start immediately.
Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? Theyre all panicked here...
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
And look where it's led you...  I'm gonna get her on the phone...
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
So you left her?  Just like that?
Excuse me?
You?  Married?
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
Oh, and Oxxford called...
You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.
Cmon Jack...
Got a minute, Jack?
The Caddy?  Why dont you take your own damn car!
What the hell are you talking about?  Whats he talking about?
Get out!
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
Get out, I call 911.
You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!
Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
Okay, youre right, weve been dancing around this for years...
Are we finally being honest?
Are we what, Jack?
Need a nurse?
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Mushroom puffs arent the only thing I do well...
Cmon, as soon as I put them down, youre gonna grab a couple...you always do...
Finger food...?
I thought I saw you notice it at the kids recital.
Like the dress...?
I dont care who you are.  Its Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
Mr. Mintz?  I dont think so...buildings closed pal.  Youll have to come back tomorrow.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
Okay, chief.
You want me to handle him?  I think Im ready...
Kates on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure youre okay?
Uh huh...
No, I didnt...thats great.
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
Uh-huh...
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  Im putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, lets get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
No...
You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...
Hello Jack.  You dont have to stop singing on my account...
Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
He certainly has your number, Alan.
...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
Do I know you?
Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Aspen.
I need you, tiger..
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
Hey, my wifes in the kitchen. You got a cigarette?
Is there anything I can do for you?
Hey, are you okay?
Kate? No, theres no one here named Kate.  Is that good enough for you?
Can I help you?
Okay, Ill take them...
Merry Christmas...
Maybe I can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning...  Okay?
Don't you have anywhere to go?
I'm taking the train...
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
I'd like that, too.
Thanks.  You're not bad yourself...
Last night was great...
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
Congratulations. The La Guardia flights canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
Ill go for a cup of coffee!
Maybe its by the wardrobe boxes...
Hey, kind of giving up Christmas day for my ex-boss here.
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?
I mean...
I wouldn't know anything about that.
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
This ain't permanent.  My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
Relax, it's casual.
I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
What did you wish for, honey?
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
Baby, you're scaring me.
Ben?
Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you.
I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
I wish I could tell you.  I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
No: You're <u>ON FIRE</u>!
You're on fire!
Last one down springs for room service.
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
You're hot!
And where do we think we're going?
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
Then what is it?
Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
They're ready for you, sir.
And if he's not...?
Skeptical...?
Reed's gonna fix me up --
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
'Scuse me.
I'm married.
May I?
I can't tell you that either... Excuse me, Mr. Grant, but you've got a smudge on your cheek.
I can't tell you.
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
Uh -- what?
Come on -- it's no use!
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
Sort of.
How's it look?
What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
Look at those Walls up ahead!
Yes, there is.
We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.
It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.
Not to the valve. But we've lost too much air to make it the rest of the way.
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
I'll never find my way through that.
That's it...
On the Repeater.
Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
Fluid is seeping through. Better come down and have a look!
What do you mean?
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
The Wall's transparent...
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
I'll do what I can.
Then don't drift down further.
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
May I have your ticket, please?
Well, see, there's a minimum charge of four dollars. Long-term parking charges by the day.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
You, uh... I'm sorry, sir, but -
...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?
What's this, sir?
Can I see your license and registration please?
You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.
This is a new car, then, sir?
...What're you talking about?
I don't know. Few munce.
I don't think so. It's nice.
Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook. Let's get this over with.
One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this!
Oh, don't be silly.
Oh, don't be silly.
Both of these.
Yah, he -
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan.
They can really take over, that's for sure.
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
Any others?
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
Ya got that right.
Yah, got a front movin' in.
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Just a general way.
Uh-huh - in what way?
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
What'd this guy look like anyways?
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Oh sure.
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
White Bear Lake?
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
Ya got that right.
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
I unnerstand.
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
Uh-huh.
...So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.'  And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,' And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.'
Yah, right-o.
Officer Olson.
Yah.
Mr. Mohra?
How ya doin'?
Oh, yah? Twin Cities?
Yah.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
The numbers y'asked for, calls made from the lobby pay phone at the Blue Ox. Two to Minneapolis that night.
No, I gotta - hey, Norm, I thought you were goin' fishin' up at Mile Lacs?
Hiya, Norm. How ya doin', Margie? How's the fricassee?
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
Uh-huh.
Yah.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.
Chaska.
Yah.
A subconscious-type thing.
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
He was a little older. Looked like the Marlboro man.
LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
Hold on.
...What's the big deal? It's an hour -
Oh, man!
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
Yeah!
You know what a disparity is?
Uh-huh.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
Uhn.
You're not a C student.
Uh-huh.
I'm talkin' about your potential.
Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
Yah.
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
What's the next step here, Jerry?
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
Jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
You're sayin' - what're you sayin'?
Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
Good to see ya again, Jerry. If these numbers are right, this looks pretty sweet.
Ya kiddin'!
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
You bet.
Yeah, but -
Dad, I really think we should call the cops.
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Ya got the car?
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
Are you calling Stan?
...Is everything okay?
Twice.
Stan Grossman called.
...Dad?
Nope.
Call 'em up.
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
Mm.
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
Ya gotta eat a breakfast...
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
I'll fix ya some eggs.
Gotta go?
Nope.
Uh-huh.
So?
Nope.
Yep.
Nope.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
I'm tellin' ya.
We gotta protect Jean. These - we're not holdin' any cards here, Wade, they got all of 'em. So they call the shots.
I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here.
He's at Norstar.
Congratulations, Jerry.
He was killed serving Project Mayhem.
He was killed in action.
The garden.  Take him there.  Move, people.  Let's do this!
The first rule of Project --
That wouldn't interest you.
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such information to you, nor would I, even if I had said information you want, at this juncture be able.
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
You know about the guy who invented it? I hear all kinds of things. Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution.  They say he only sleeps one hour a night.  You know about this guy?  Tyler Durden?
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
You are?!
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
No.  I found something new.
Better than I've ever been in my life.
Cornelius!  How are you?
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid.
We're still men.
Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do?
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
Is that your blood?
Have you finished those reports?
Here are your flight coupons.  Call me from the road if there are any snags.  Your itinerary...
You need to make these your primary "action items."
I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  We've got some "red-flags" to cover.
Well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call.  In the meantime, don't leave town.  I may need to bring you in for questioning.
I'll ask the questions, son.
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
It means it was homemade.
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
The dynamite...
Does this sound strange to you?
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
You want to see pain?  Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the guys with testicular cancer.  That's pain.
You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew valerian root and get some more exercise.
You need to lighten up.
No, you can't die of insomnia.
You fucking slut!!
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
Oh, yeah.
Who's this?
Who's this?
You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden.
Is this part of the test?
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
You were in here last Thursday night.
Is this a test, sir?
How have you been?
Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
Nine time out of ten, it's an electric razor.  But, every once in a while ...  ...it's a dildo.  It's airline policy not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo.  We use the indefinite aricle: "A dildo."  Never "Your dildo."
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
Throwers don't worry about ticking. Modern bombs don't tick.
Tell the other person how you feel.
Now, find your power animal.
Okay, everyone.
...And you open the door and you step inside.  We're inside our hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a white ball of healing light.  That's right, the pain itself is a ball of healing light.
Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...
Well, sir, you said you might.
You told me you'd say that, too.
You told me you'd say that.
Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
Very good, Sir.
Maintenance.
His name is Robert Paulson!
Robert Paulson?
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
But, this is Project Mayhem.
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
Let go of me!!
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!
What are you doing?!
Did you hear what I just said?!
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
Ain't that something?
Really?
He don't own this place, I do.  How much money's he getting for this?
Irvine?  Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
No, please, no, God, no!
Too much school.
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
I... I don't know...
Biology, mostly.
S-S-Stuff.
Please, God, no...
Yesssss...
How'd you know?
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
I'm not sure I understand.
Um, Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I...
What, you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago?  You're nuts.
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
That lucky bastard.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Who?
Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
A Trans Am.  That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
Yeah, you should have specified.
Calm down, Kimmy.  It's not drugs, just weed.
Blow me.
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
I thought we were finished with this bullshit.  This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.
Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you?
Do you want to deliver this baby?
I've got to stop and help those people.
Please.  It's not going to wait.
Take my van!
Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.
Jorge.  When I get out of here I'm going to sue his cheating ass off.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
She did.
Take a guess.
We had a fight.  Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me.  Wouldn't say where she was going.
No.  What's this about?
Maybe.  What's this about?
What?
I never mad it.  The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.
Yeah, so what happened?
I got that beat.  So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.
But why single me out?  What am I in the great scheme of things?  You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man.
Yeah?
Here's what I don't get.  For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
Anyway, I guessed it right and won these.
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
This can't be happening.  My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house...
Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
For Christ sakes girl, take a breath.
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
What is it?  What are you?
What is it?  What are you?
How does a nice mature fuck sound?
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
Want me to drive?
Would you take these?  And if I die...  Could you throw all my drugs out? Paraphernalia, porno, you know... Anything that would break my mom's heart.
And you're gonna die after me, right?
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
Can I ask you a question?
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette.
I don't know what I'd do if I lost you.
There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.
What feeling?
I mean it.  Take care of it.
Your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid.  I want you to have it checked ASAP at a gas station.
Kimberly?  It's Dad.
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
I know, honey.  I just --
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Nice try, kiddo.
You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight?  I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
You think... You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what?
Yeah?
Mom?
Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
Who am I, David Blane?
What on Earth are they doing?
I know, we'll be there soon.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
You're the fuckin' devil.
What's your fuckin' worry? If it's not your time...? I could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
We're losing our favorite teacher.
All I owe is these people.  To live my life to the fullest.
Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
I'll remove him.
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
Been on many planes that blew up, have you?
Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin' "Stepmom."
Fag.
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
"Next?"
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
No harm. No foul.
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
In Death...
Cuticle lacerations.
I know who you are.
No one's that strong.
It broke!
Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
And don't pass on the right.
SHUT UP, BILLY!
I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
That's what I'm doin'!
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
You have a responsibility to tell me.
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
Terry's name should be on this wall.
There's the Mekong.
Star Wars?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.
Wow!
Put it in the guard's barracks.  Man they got pissed.  They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run around.
Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you call this?
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
You guys are real... aren't you?
Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.
Sorry, Sir.
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
Let's get that tent down!
That's right.
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
Don't look so disappointed.  It should be hairy enough... even for you.
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
Not yet.
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
He... took it.
What?
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
Christ almighty.
Um... actually, no.  It looks like he shot down one of their gunships...
What?
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
Typical...
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
What that?
You're out of your depth, Trautman. Way out.  I'm acting correctly here. Not you.  Not your gung-ho jungle ace.  It's over.  Walk away.
Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
That's a crock.  We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way.
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
Word came down... they wanted an answer.  And they knew the answer they wanted: no POWs.  But it had to look good.  Best effort.  The whole dog-and-pony show.
Look, it was a screw-up, alright? They weren't supposed to find anything.  We thought that camp was empty.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
Have fun.
That's a pretty hairy ride.  Full Colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing.
It's not necessary.
What's up?
The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.
About 22 hours on site.
De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.
I could a couple of days ago.  Gonna be... stiff.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
Who're you?
You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives?  Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be sent back to the same institution..
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
She <u>likes</u> me.  She said for me to call!
No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...
I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...
He's not here.
Can I help you?
He and his wife was were at some bar ..and some nut came in with a shotgun and blew the place apart. She was a beautiful girl...She never knew what hit her.
Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
You a friend of Parry's?
<u>I tell him no visitors</u>!!!
Where you comin' from?!
I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.
Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.
Venice...Like Katherine Hepburn in SUMMERTIME. . ....Why can't I be Katherine Hepburn...
No...no...we can't...we can't..
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
I wanna go...Just let me go...
Leave me alone...I wanna go...
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  Leave me alone!!
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
.....Me neither.
Good.  You believe this drunk?
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
I was nine in the sixties.
No, I have to work.
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
Fine.
Fine.  I'll say no.
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
You can ask.
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
Oh, Lydia!
What girl?  I didn't notice.
You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
OWW...MAN...
Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!
You advise us!
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
Fuck you.
You a fag too?
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
See, I told you it was him...  Your name's Donnie something, right?
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.
Well, id'n that nice.
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
No, but it was very clever... I would of just punched her out.
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
Hey, mack!
It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
Who? People, that's who! Pretty soon there won't be room for anyone. They're selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine. Oofh! Crap! I believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it.
I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.
Alaska.
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
How far are you going to?
Palm Apodaca.
Seven hundred dollars, down the toilet! I'd like to go back and punch the son of a bitch out! Can you give us a lift?
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
You want me to hold the chicken.
One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
I don't make the rules.
Would you like to talk to the manager?
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
I'll come back when you've made up your mind...
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
No. We have tomatoes.
No substitutions.
Five'll do it.
Can I get you anything else?
I always tell everyone the same thing. I got rolled and beat up real bad recently, and since then it's two for one, an' I work strictly in tandem with Betty...
I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...  We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?
Are you talking to us?
Robert, I think you better just...
Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
All right, let's have a rematch.
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
I'm not aware of it. Like what?
What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
Robert, do you mind?
I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
It's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck. If I wanted to turn toward Catherine, for instance, I'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around...  ... like this...
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
No, the last time was three years ago.
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
Come on, get moving, dammit!!
It's a Borzoi.
No, you're not. Go ahead and take your time.
Not at all.
Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and I said, "What for?" Whatever the hell he's doing, even if it's a completely wasteful escapade, it's entirely his business. Simple as that...
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...
It is true.
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
Well, I should hope not...
But I'd like to say, so that I don't dampen the spirit of your adventure...
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.
Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
Hold onto this.
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
Don't call me "honey," mack.
Bullshit! Truck drivers know the best eating places on the road.
Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.
Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
Right, steam. A car you could ride around in and not cause a stink. But do you know, they will not even let us have it. Can you believe it? Why?! Man! He likes to create a stink. I wrote them a note once, and told them to clean it... I mean, don't you see that? It's just filthy! I mean, I've seen filth you wouldn't believe! Oofh, what a stink! I don't even want to talk about it...
Steam.
And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...
Yeah, it could be adorable...
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
Mass production is what does it.
Perhaps...
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media...
Pardon me?
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
If you want to call it that.
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
Miss Dupea.
Alright.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
Is it true?
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
Alright, tell me, what'd you hear?
Just get the fuck outta here.
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
Then don't go out with me.
I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated.
So get the fuck outta here.
Please don't scream at me. I like you, but I don't like the way your attitude is.
Hurry up, you're wastin' my time, what the fuck.
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
Not now, I'm busy
Why you have an attitude for?
What?
Look at me.
Fine.
Aaron, how you doin'?
Don't fuck wit' me! Don't fuck wit' me.  My lawyer's so good he'll have you workin in Alaska, so dress warn.
Why don't you ask Eddie?
Eddie from Compost?
Wussup, Victor.
Who gives!
Come down!
Okay, then dance. Show.
Yeah.
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.
Like this?
Um, yeah I think so.
You gonna talk to him?
I think he's 18 or 17.
How old is he?
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.
You said before, that he got boxes?
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
A bad attitude.
Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
How does he look up close?
I suggest you turn around and go back to where you came from.
Yo, that's my girl.
What she look like?
Who?
You here to see somebody?
You looking for somebody?
I know how ta get him back if you want.
You gotta girLfrLend?
You live around here?
Where you know Amanda from?
Hey!
You wanna do somethin' with me?
So, then whadda ya want?
Nothing.
Probably.  One of the many.
How do I know you're not lying.
So what do you want with her anyway?
Your friend must be misinformed.
Positive.
Positive.
By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
Unbelievable.
Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off --
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
You mean her.
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
Would you like me to change anything?
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
You're lucky.
What? What are you talking about?
Hey you're really nuts.
Fletch!
Fletch, this is dumb.
Nineteen.
I ought to get some sleep.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
I have no idea.
Sonofabitch.
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
This one's going to be even more fun.
Greetings, everyone.
Thanks for coming down to see us.
That a boy.
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
What'll it be Fletch?
Ask anybody.
After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it.
You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want... Jane Doe?
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
Full name.
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
What, 'long distance?' I couldn't help but hear you say something about Rio, Alan. You're not leaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars I staked you for the next load, are you?
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
What the hell are you doing here?
Till then.
Cash. I'm impressed.
This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
You may be right.
I agree.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
And what was that?
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
I'd have been long gone.
'...with his legal wife, the former Sally Ann Cavanaugh.'
Wait a second --
What?
Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
Of course.
Good evening.
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
John Ultramalensky, right?
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
Where are you going?
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
My hero.
That's one thing I did find. It's from last month, so it was in the unsorted pile.
Did you say cops?
Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did ---
Only one way to find out.
You doing a story on this guy?
Not our kind of people, you understand.
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
No problem, boss.
Not me.
Shoot.
'Magic' today, huh?
Only if you promise not to return me.
Yo!
How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party?
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
She's cute as a button.
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
Cute thing.
His bride. Cute as a button.
Cute young thing, too.
Tell the cops.
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
What did you want under the bed?
This morning.
She moved out.
Moved out.
Who are you?
What?
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
Lock's busted.
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
Who's Frieda?
And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
Jim Swarthout?
Mrs. Stanwyk!
Of course.
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.
I said, I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
But I ain't got you...
Thanks for the promotion, man.
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
Right away!
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
Hey, they blew me.
Three hundred.
Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
Got those Vomit invites here...
That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you.  You look at this picture and all you see is beauty.  I see the beast.
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
Like me.
'Booty Time.'
Two words.  Disco Express.
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
What are you running from?
Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
Anyway you want it, asshole.
The point?
How's it going?
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
What's fine?
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
Polo.
This isn't music!
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
Hi, private eye guy!
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
That's cute.  You're funny.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
You're that guy, the private eye.
I hope you solve the case and I know you will, because you're the best.  Ford, guys like you don't grow on trees.
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
Just find her, man.  She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my mother, she's some little brat I stood in line with at Taco Bell last week.  Do whatever you want with my words.  And my money.
So...
What?
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
What?
Mr. Doyle.
Doyle.
This side.
Who knows?
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
Doesn't register.
Boca?
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
Everything is everything.
No - no.
No.
I'm clean.
Don't forget anchovies.
Yeah?
Sal --
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
Well try, okay?
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
You know I hadda meet some people tonight --
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
Takin' care o' business, honey.
Where are you?
Man, I'm clean.
No... yeah...
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
What?
I don't...
Fuck you, Santa Claus!
Goodbye.
Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.
Not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not.  The police know you brought the car into the country.  This makes you an accomplice.
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
I wasn't looking.
Did they follow you?
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Did you pick up the car?
Enchant.  Alain, j'ai rflchi  votre proposition et j'ai dcid d'accepter.
Henri c'est gentil d'tre venu.  Je vous prsente mon associ, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
It's yours too!
It's your problem.
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
It has to be by the end of this week.
Hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
Yes --
Twelve o'clock... yes...
... Salvatore?...
Who's this --
Allo... Salvatore...
That's a relief.
I'm going to put them on the cat.
Are you sure it is dead?
Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.
Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
Non!
Le sommes nous?
Je n'ai jamais vu tant de srenit. Elle m'a demand de tes nouvelles et si nous tions heureux.
Comment va-t-elle?
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis pass voir Franoise.
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Pour moi?
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Avec a tu pourras le supporter.
Regarde mon pcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire trs froid cet hiver.
Encore du sho ping!
Oh Alain!  C'est merveilleux!  Tu me gtes.  Je t'aime.  Attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai achet.
Si tu veux.
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Tu sais j'ai rflchi longuement  ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-mme.  Tiens.
What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
There'll be someone else.
Mmmmm.  That bastard who followed me on the subway, he's the eager one.
He is not wrong.
I don't know.  Boca is scared. He's not strong enough.  He sees policemen in his soup.
But will they?
We must follow it.
What happens to the schedule?
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
Sois gentil avec lui.  On ne sait jamais.  Il peut te faire travailler  la tlvision.
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
Une erreur!  C'est gnial.  C'est une vedette  la tlvision.  Il peut aller partout sans tre souponn... En plus il a besoin de fric.
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
Il est en retard.
Il fallait le faire.
Sale boulot.
Mmm.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
Who financed it?
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
It's beautiful.
I got no music!
You're for real?
What?
S'right.
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
That's in France.
Marseilles.
I think so.  But they're in Room 408.  On the fourth floor.
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another.  He's in shipping.
Businessman.  Owns a department store in Des Moines, I think.
Des Moines.
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
There may be two... no, three who could fit it.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
There's nobody like that on six.
We have four rooms and six suites on six.  There's a man in almost every one of them.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours.  The kid comes in at six will wake ya.  A couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the joint.
When ya go back on?
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
Where the hell do you think it is, potato head?
Yeah!
Why not?
They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent.
Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
Forty dollars -- was $250.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
Hey, Bo.
For dead bodies.
For garbage?
It was a crematorium.
What was it?
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
What is that old building?
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast.  Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here.
Why is it called Hellgate?
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
Darling, may I have this one?
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
Just for mistakes of parking?
There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.
He could go someplace else with his sixty kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million cash.  He wouldn't find there was any hurry to do this kind of business.
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
I been damn careful up to now.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.
Oh, my God!  What is that?!  Why you showing me this shit!?  JESUS!  JESUS! Get those away from me!
Nothing.
So what?
What I know is what I told you.
No, I don't.
What are you saying?
Yeah.
That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some.
I'll go find Hayes.
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
Where's the collar, in the cells?
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
They around?
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
Yeah.
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
Switches are shorted out.
You okay, man?
Gotta be another way up, Frank.
Don't know what's behind it.
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
I should'a been a fucking mailman.
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
I seem nervous, huh?
Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted.
Baltimore?
I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
Wait...
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
I'm scared.
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
Daddy, I'm scared.
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
You got a deal, mister.  I mean Santa.
I better give you my address then.
How'd you know my name, mister?
This is the Space Cowboy.  I'm an intergalactic traveler from the Federation planet earth.
Huh?
Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
Huh?
What?
John.  John, you all right?
How you feeling?
I know pal.  I remember.  Twenty-nine years tomorrow.
Go in where?
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
Sull!  What the hell!
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
Sully!  Is that you?
Fuck you, asshole.
Sullivan?
Who the fuck is this?
Hell-
Who are you?
Huh.
No kiddin'?
I hear that.
A hot shot, huh?
No.  What house you work?
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this...
Drop me off?  How do you mean?
Going?  How do you mean?
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
Be a man, man.
Will you come with me?
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Don't do that to me!
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
What's the matter?!
It's Friday the 13th.
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
This is all the exercise I need...
Maybe we should do some exercise.
And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin' down there either.
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
It's dark down there.
I love you, man!
I'm a slow eater.
Chuck... look.
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!
Yes, man!
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
You know him?
Sure, just watch where you're going.
It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
After you left me that night, I didn't see you or talk to you again for a year.  No one would tell me anything.  All I know is what the police told me.  We have nowhere to go unless you let me in.  What happened?
What happened that night?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
And, what about us?
Why did you come back here?
What do you mean?
You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.  The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
This is too painful to look at.
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
Shelly!  Where are you?!
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
No.  I got here just before you did.
Look what I found.  Remember these?
What?
Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
You're irresistible.  I lose control.
Is that so bad?
Hello.  How are you?
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
Why?
No way...  ...I wanna rock!
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
Alright, alright.
Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
What?  Who pulled it out?!
Go out and plug the cord back in.
What?
My friggin' stepfather and asshole- in-residence.
Who's Horace?
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
Great.  Just great.
I thought that was the end of the song.
Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
Oh, jeez.
Just drive.  He'll get out of our way.
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
We're gonna scare him?!
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
Why?  Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.
Why?
Darren, we better turn around.
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
Sheriff, you better take this.
Happy Friday the 13th.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
I wish it was.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
I could swear I heard...
Ahh, nothing.
Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!
See any paint?...  ...Sorry, guys, I did in Mr. Commando.  Survival is the name of the game, and that flag is mine.
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
....with a woman's touch.
It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
Never should've let her play.
This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.
Yeah, that's fat too.
My ass.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
No.  No, it's not...
Daddy, what is going on?
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
All he's asking is for you to check it out.
I thought Jason was only a legend?
What it is?
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
But, Dad, we...
Jason who?
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
Did you hear me?!
They did show up.  Isn't that great?
Lake Forest Green?
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
Wait a minute. I just...
Okay, give it back.
Why?
There...Ya happy?
What's it to ya?
It's all over.
You got it.  Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
Then let's get goin'.  We can argue on the way.  You tell me what you need...  ...I'll make sure you get in.
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
Shhh...You know what I used to do when I was a little girl when I got scared?
But what I get scared again?
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
We'll scare 'em right back.
But what if they try and scare us?
Who ya calling?
I can't believe no one called back.  I better...
Huh?
That's debatable.
Are they grown-ups?
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
Why?
You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.
I found it outside.
Where'd you get this?
No more.
...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
Well, Nancy, I'm Paula... remember?  This is Sissy, and we're gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?...
Nancy.
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
No, he was real.  Like on TV.
You mean you had a bad dream.
There was this monster.  He was after me.  He wanted to kill me.
So what happened?
I think somebody's messin' around out there.
What's goin' on?
Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
He didn't say anything?
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
Yeah, we're here.
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
Of course not.  She probably took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it.  I still don't get it.  Why him?  I mean, he's cute alright, but...
No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
Okay, okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.
You gotta be kidding!
Boy scouting.
Which is?
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
So where's Cort gone off to?
All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
-- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
Skin stretcher was human.
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
Well, let's hope not!
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
Eight times.
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
I'm scared.  I'm very scared.
Steven...
Save your...
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
No.  Not here.  Come by my house tonight at eleven.  Don't be late.
...but there just may not be enough time.  If you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better between you two...we should talk.
Yes.
That's it, we're done.
I know everything about you, Diana.
You need to leave.
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
What do you want?
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
Look, I don't want your money!
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
Look --
Twenty.
No, I --
You food'll be right out.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
Jason Voorhees is dead.
I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
I'm kind of busy right now...
I need to talk to you.
I know who you are.
Yes.
Anything else?
June the 19th.
Hello...
N...nothing.
What's the problem here?
Okay, I'll call you later.
I gotta get back to work.
Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
Ed...
Do you have to ask?
Steven buggin' you?
Not so bad, today.
Legs giving you trouble?
It's going.
Everything going okay?
'Night, Josh.
Good night, beautiful.
Okay.
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.
So's he and he knows it.
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around.  He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
It's...It's all right.
Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
Jesus!
You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
Lock this asshole up.
Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
Tell me!
Sorry.
Tell me.
For a good reason.
Why did you want her body?
That's what I'd like to know.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
That's very colorful, chief.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
Goddamnit!
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
You're talking about my lady.
Why don't you blow me, Chief.  After your girlfriend gets through.
Get up!
Maybe you should mind your own business.
Maybe you should be moving on.
Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
Does he know about what happened?
I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around?
Why didn't you tell me?
She's yours?
Her name's Stephanie.
She's beautiful.
That's all right.  I was just...
Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
-- Bad?!
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
About what?
Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
You don't know shit!
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
Until I hear the truth.
Oh, my dear God...
A pizza?!
I'm literally going to kill you!
Steven!
That's disgusting.
I mean really never.
Never.
So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
No.
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
And you'll never do it again.
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
Hear what?
Did you hear that?
So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?
Right.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
Right.
There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
Tell me.
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
What murders?
Nothing.
What's wrong?
Ask me in about five minutes.
Well...how do you feel?
I...I can't...
You're telling a lie.
He is not.
I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
What a beautiful day.
Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...
The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
What is your location?
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
Ruptured steam pipe.
We must abandon.
Very bad today.
You are going where?
Big mess every time.
I opened thousands of brains.
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
Where you're going, mister?
Did you see the winning run score?
What are we talking about?
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
Unbelievable.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Does what feel comfortable?
Does it feel comfortable?
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could Pbe it.
Let's work on it.
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
It's your best play, Nicky.
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
What's sexy?
Mystery. Deception.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
This building is not secure.
If you're wondering about the firearm.
What else?
What else?
First you tell me.
Names are incredibly intimate. We barely know each other. Trust me on this.
It's only our first date.
Life is true.
This could be it!
You're hurting my head.
What did it say?
Washed away.
People are dependable.
Life is good.
Great game. Red Sox are winning.
What's it like to shoot somebody?
What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
You're out of bullets.
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore.
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
They're my team.
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
Then they lost?
You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
So what happened since? You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews?
I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said.
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
Game six is history,pal.
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
How come?
But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
Yessiree, Bob.
Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.
That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
Burnt sienna.
What color?
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
I have excellent long-term memory.
I was educated by nuns.
Sidney.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
But you're here. So you must have come to me.
You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.
"I will follow you in all our vows and duties."
"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."
"I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people."
"Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."
Eleven.
God gave you ten thumbs.
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
Please! You're being foolish!
All the more reason.
I am your wife.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
It is the work of untouchables.
Everyone takes his turn.
Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.
Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
Oww!
Yes -- I can't talk like this.
Are you sure?
Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack."
They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
As I told you about English policemen.
"A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest." -- I told you about English law.
Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
Just an admirer...
One more.
Enough.
I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
Not without defeats -- and great pain.  But are there no defeats in this war -- no pain?  What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler -- or anyone. You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.
But do you really believe you could use non-violence against someone like Hitler?
Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?
Stop!
No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
Did they take your clothes?
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
Going nearer to God!
What are you doing?
Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
No violence, please.
Well, we shall try.
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
I am. But I'm not so egotistical as to think He plans His day around my dilemmas.
I thought you were a man of God.
That was lucky.
Not anymore.  At first I was amazed... but when you are fighting in a just cause, people seem to pop up -- like you -- right out of the pavement. Even when it is dangerous or --
Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?
You're a clergyman.
Some of it good, I hope.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
I'm sorry.
You'd be Gandhi --  ...I thought you'd be bigger.
He said he's in charge...
What'd he say?
Well, he must've found some of the answers...
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
What was he like?
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
You mean Gandhi?
Oh, I've been a Gandhi buff for a long time.
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did.
No, no -- just a moment, please.
I'll take your luggage back, baas.
Well, I don't know how you got a ticket for --
A -- a week.
Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?
No -- neither do I. But...  but this man is a Christian and he has written --
"Hell!"
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
What do you want?
I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.
Wait and see... wait and see...
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
And Jinnah?
Panditji -- please, help me.
I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
Tell that to the families of the policemen who died.
It was one incident.
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
We must end the campaign.
What can we do?
I've never spoken for anything else.
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
I think if we all worked to publicize it... all of the Congress... every avenue we know.
Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live.
I thought you were against fighting.
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
Are you going to walk all the way?
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
Is it over if they arrest you now?
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
You've done me a great service.
I've traveled so far -- and thought so much.  As you can see, my city was a sea city -- always filled with Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and Persians.  The temple where you were yesterday is of my family's sect, the Pranami. It was Hindu of course but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita, moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as God was worshipped.
A great deal.
Do you remember much of South Africa?
Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
Hm.  Is it?
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
Even as a boy I thought so.
It's beautiful.
I hope not.
You're an ambitious man.
That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men.
You will respect the law.
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community.  You belong to a very important profession.
No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
You should ride the pony. It is not necessary to walk to prove the point.
I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles.
I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
Do you find me stubborn?
First spin. Let the others march for a time.
I would rather march.
Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
It has. But you'd be surprised. They understand -- they really do. It's not the workers you have to worry about.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
You mean a general strike?
I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll have much to discuss.
The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend  and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked.
I --
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
There is nothing I can give.
We need your help!
That's when you take advantage.
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
Not true!  The secret is mastering the urge.
It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.
Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious...
I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
No.
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
Who is that young man?
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Well, that's one victory.
It's split the Government.
The fools!  Sorry...
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
So did I.
No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
They're sparing no one, I see.
I -- I will write to the press -- here -- and in England.  And I will use the courts.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker.
You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
That was England.
In England, I was a poor student but I --
Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
All right. Fine.
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
Assuming we are in agreement?
I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
You're an extraordinary man.
I congratulate them.
Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
Very well.
I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?
Somehow I expected not.
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
Ahh.
I dined at the prison.
Perhaps some tea?
Thank you. No.
Will you have a glass of sherry?
Thank him for his letter, and put him in jail.
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
I don't know! Nehru, Patel, almost every Congress Official is in jail... and their wives and their children -- we've even arrested Nehru's mother.
Who's leading them?
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of "Free India." Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt.
And that's the basis of this "Declaration of Independence"?
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
Could we cut all news off? I know --
...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
Have you found him?
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
No -- but I think I'm going to.
Have you read his magazine?
He's "discovering" India.
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!
How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
I will prove it to you.  Come swim with me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
It's for the best.
It's over.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
It would be five thousand more.
How much extra?
I have to warn you, Mr Luca, he's going to be at least a head taller than you. Prepare for a crick in the neck in sixteen years time.
I like football.
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
Er, no...
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
He's right, Maria.  That's right.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
I'll take care of it.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
No?  What's keeping you?
So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
Where did you get this?
Luca could still be an accomplice.
So we have two choices.  Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.
What are you waiting for?
I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
Something's not right.
Blood.  From the vein.
A man can change his face--but blood is forever. Sample every employee within the parameters I gave you.  Intravenous.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
No.  Not <i>likely</i>.
So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
--What <i>about</i> his profile?
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
Grudges?
A man's dead, Detective.
I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards.
At least it's nothing contagious.
This time I will supervise each test personally.
Twelve have a mission within the week.
No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
Thank you, no.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
This unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor.
What a relief.
We believe we have a suspect.
We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
Surely you know what you have.
Often.
How often do you test, Director?
I don't know exactly, Jerome.
German.
Suit yourself.
What's wrong with it?
You okay, Jerome?
He's too tall.
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
What will happen to the others?
I have to caution you it's not fool-proof. With multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees.
Antonio, the choir...
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
Anything I've forgotten?
--We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
There's a way.
Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
You can wear lifts.
How tall are you?
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
I'd have to bleach my hair.
Yeah.
That's the hair color in his profile?

It happened in Australasia.  He checked in yesterday.  No family complications, no record he ever broke his neck.  As far as anybody's concerned, he's still a walking, talking, fully-productive member of society. You just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life.  Excuse me, <i>your</i> life.
How do I square the accident?
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
I hope he's not just a body.
He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
Vincent, come down.  I've found him.
German, is that you?
Vincent...Vincent...
I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
What do you think?
A fingerprint.  There's something to be said for nostalgia.  What did you find?
I've found him too.
Hugo!  I've found him!
They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
Not that.
You worried about the cost?
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
Why not?
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do.
Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome?  He's a big fan of yours.  He wants to apply here.
Flight got you nervous?
New policy.
I've got enough here.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told you that, Jerome?
Antonio--
The name?  For the certificate.
Honey, look around you.  The world doesn't want one like <i>that</i> one.
Not like <i>this</i> one.
--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.
Honey, you've made <i>one</i> mistake--
I'm not doing it.
The doctor will give you something.
No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
I can't do this.
What are you doing?
Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.
I never have any luck.
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
Yeah... I guess it does.
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
By the way, you're getting a hell of a car there, mister.
Hope you get to where you're going.
That little job cost me a hundred dollars... didn't even get to keep the fish.
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
Gonna knock down a wall?
All right. Shells?
Can I help you?
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
Aren't we going a little hard?
Whatever you need.
I'm good at that.
Wire pull over?
What about the vault?
Okay. How many bank exits?
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Yeah. I got out.
Chicago.
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
Can't leave the desk.
He took the day off.
Just sandwiches...
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
How about twenty thousand?
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
And I keep my mouth shut?
You serious?
'Bout five thousand.
What's it to you?
Don't you want to go to the airport?
Which way?
Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
Why not?
Where we go in1?
How was that?
Suit yourself.
I Just want to find a suitcase.
Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
That's what matters, isn't it?
Can he trust you?
Two years.
How long have you been married?
You can trust him...
That right?
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...
You do what he says, Harold.
That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back...
A Ford... We have a Ford.
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
Just... tell us what you want.
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
I'll tell you when.
I've got to stop.
That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
I got a nurse in mind.
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
What's the damage?
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
Well, he drove it into the river.
Oh ay?
What's it got to do with you?
What do you want?
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
Jack...
Jack, you're wrong.
Christ, what...
I don't know. That's all I was told.
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming,  It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother?  I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back,  You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother,  One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs.  So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit,  So I'm worried. I can't fight them  I haven't that kind of set-up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead.
A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?
Bloody well tell me who sent you.
What about?
What?
Well?
You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
Can I go now?
On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.
He's got a new place at Burnham.
Brumby!
No, don't Jack, don't.
I can't Jack. How can I?
I've been asked to make sure you don't.
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
Confidential, like.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Jack?
Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
No. It's all right.
No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
No. Frank was a good bloke.
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.
Thanks.
Wilton Estate.
At me friend's house.
No.
Yeah.
Yes.
Working at Woolworths.
I left last year.
They said he was drunk.
Yeah.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
Not going, Jack?
Nasty way to go.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
Eric told me of your bereavement.
Piss off, Ray.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Shut up.
Gerald wants to see him first.
The gun he means.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
But they have to be diplomatic.
We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid.
He said it'd be doing him a big favour.
We've got to take you back to London.
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
What? And get the clap?
Knock it off, Gerald.
Not suede boots!
Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
Ask me?
What for? Protective purposes?
They do that up North.
Bollock naked with his socks still on?
Shut up.
How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
I'll see you, then.
No.
You're not seeing me?
That's right.
Four hundred?
That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.
What's that?
Ha.
All right. Two hundred.
Three hundred altogether, Harry.
Three hundred altogether?
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
What's that?
Your hundred, and another hundred.
That's right, Harry.
What's that? A hundred?
That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack?
You're bluffing, you bastard!
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
Get in the goddamn room.
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
Would you come in here, please?
Mr. Levene...?
Hey, fella, let's get this done...
Could I...
The people downtown said...
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
You have a problem?
Roma!  I'm talking to you...
Levene!!
Levene!
Aaronow...
Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?
Would you excuse us, please.
Moss...Who told him?
Who told you...?
Who are you?
Would you excuse us, please...?
Excuse me, fella.
Excuse me, sir...
I'm not hungry.
I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
I can help you.
Why do you have to go?
Will you take me?
I know.  How long will you be gone?
On your pillow.
Did you see my present for you?
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
I got lots of presents.
Yes.
At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
What position did you occupy?
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
That's right.
Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
Go on, answer him when he talks to you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi... Garibaldi.
Who is the greatest man you can think of?
This man informs to the police; this man allows his vengeance to be bought off... No, he is alone.
What?  You read it in the papers?
Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.
If you like, why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I guarantee he will accept that amount from me.
They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood.
Oh yes, the very best.
Your friend lives in a fine building.
No.  He would give it away.  I know how to repay a consideration.
We have no money for a rug.
I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it.
Then, after that, what?  Joe 'Little Knife' Pisani; Willie Bufalino, maybe, Mr. Maranzalla himself, c'mon!
He's going to kill Fanucci.
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
What can we do?
You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
What if we don't pay?
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars?  I think he would.
She couldn't decide.
What took so long?
Merle, have you met my sister-in- law Deanna?
Connie.
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
You go see your children first, and then you wait to see your brother like everybody else.
This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
Bought at the airport.
I got surprises for everybody!
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
How are the kids?
Yes, thank you.
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
I hated you for so long, Michael; for so many years.  I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you would know -- and you would be hurt too.  But I understand you now; I think I do.  You were being strong for all of us, like Papa was.  And I forgive you, and want to be close to you now.  Can't you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet, and helpless without you.
I want to talk to you, Michael.
Kids, why don't you go outside for a while?
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Is Kay coming?
It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
Because I need MONEY!
You're not my father!
Michael...
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.
I don't want to stay here...
I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
These Eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
What's 'cent' Anne?'
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
I know.  I know, Michael.  It's Christmas, your brothers and sister are all here -- we are happy. Let's not spoil this.  Go your own way, but when you are ready, come to me the way a son should.  I have hopes for you...
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
You would risk your life for strangers?
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
Would you like some?
He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
The child cannot harm you.
He will grow strong.
He is weak.
I'm not afraid of his words.
Don Francesco.  You murdered my husband, because he would not bend. And his oldest son Paolo, because he swore revenge.  But Vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted.  He never speaks.
Ah, you're a sharp young fellow. How is it I've never noticed you before  You're too quiet for your own interest.  I could find some work for you to do that would be very profitable.  No hard feelings, eh?  If I can ever do you a service let me know. You've done a good job for yourself tonight.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
You're a good fellow.
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
I understand...
You must understand, this is all new to me...
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
Otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. Of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, I'll dip my beak just a little.  Just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?
Ready, Frankie.
Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
Roberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.'
Chi?
The 'patrone' is here.
He took the money.  Now he wants double from everybody in the neighborhood, including Papa.
And he agreed?
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
Because he's what we say... &quot;connected&quot;... You wait, see what happens to those guys from Ninth Avenue.
Why?
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
What?
I bet you can't guess what happened?
I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?
A pig of a Neaponitan.
He's an Italian?
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
Will you tell him?
You're going to talk to him now.
I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
She's gone, Tom.
Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
Me too, Tom?
She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.
I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.
I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.
How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
What's up?
We've never sent this much with one courier.
It might show.
Fifteen percent skim?
Thanks...friend.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.
Maybe two, three thousand dollars.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
No strings.
What the hell are you talking about?
...and the tape will be running.
The committee is adjourned until further notice.
This meeting is adjourned.
The witness is excused; take him out.
Is he related to the witness?
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
Very well.
I don't think that's necessary.
Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.
If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
Get out of my hotel.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
You said you were Klingman.
Who do you think you're talking to?
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
Right here.
Where can we talk?
Who's asking?
Are you Klingman?
Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
So?
Jake, Jake, come over here.  Mike, I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he manages the casino for us.
This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
Okay.  You know he doesn't have that kind of money.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
He always makes money for his partners.  One by one, our old friends are gone.  Death, natural or not, prison, deported.  Our friend in Miami is the only one left, because he always made money for his partners.
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.
Not good.
I just left our friend in Miami.
Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?
Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
Let's forget the bullshit, I don't want to stay here any longer than I have to.  You can have the license for two hundred and fifty thousand in cash, plus a monthly fee equal to five percent of the gross...
The Corleone family controls two major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the Gaming Commission.  But I have the idea from sources...  ...that you're planning to move in on the Tropicana.  In another week or so you'll move Klingman out, which leaves you with only one technicality.  The license, which is now in Klingman's name.
Some water.
I thought we would meet alone.
No, she's here.
No sign of them yet; but they're still on the Estate.
Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.
We'll try.
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.
I won't keep you another minute...
I accept your generosity...
In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!
What was that?
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
What a terrible misunderstanding. Of course, Signora Colombo can stay in the flat.  Who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal...when they pay such low rent.
Yes.
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
Eh...  Five dollars more.
How much more a month?
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
Hey, Boone.
You coming, Boone?
Ooooh.
You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
You told me to get you up, asshole.
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
Go home, Clay.  We're closing up.
Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
Calm down, Clay.  Just calm down. We'll watch it.
I told you.  I don't turn on the TV except for the fights.
Can't say that I have.  Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
That's as good a way as any to describe it.  I've seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations.  Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
That's what I'm trying to explain.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin Tin.  Dogs are so much more dependable than men.
More your line.
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
What's our pesky friend up to now?
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
Jimmy.  How are you?
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
Boris?  Do I look a fright?
Uh-oh.  The way you look at me, James.  What have you done this time?
I am such a goose.  I mistook you for Cecil Beaton.  It's the hat. You're wearing one of Cecil's hats, you know.
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
I've changed my hair, you see. Since our last session.  Those old snaps look rather dowdy now.
Can we get together while I'm in town?  I so badly want to sit for you again.
Splendid.  Now that I know you're around.
How are you?
Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
Are you crazy? You throw down with The Carpenter? You got a grudge against your life?
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
Yeah -- ?
Me, too. Every time I walk...
No, but you dress like an asshole ...
I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
The business has changed...
Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...
Who do you think?
The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
A boost. A big boost ...
He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
It's been a long time, Memphis --
About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
Is there someplace we can talk?
Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
You spend enough time down a man's throat, you get to know his tonsils. Do it ...
What for?
Let's get out there. And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area ... Find out where they're at.
He'll live. But it means your boy's behind it. Astricky was holding a list. They just faxed it to us...
How is he?
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
By the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...
Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
You betcha --
I'll catch you later, Randall --
I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
I know you.
Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
Your girl works in there ...
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
Something like that -
What are you still doing here, Randall?
I know you.
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling. Named for the English writer of stories about India ... He bites into his pear ... Memphis says nothing, waits ...
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...
I know you.
Get out of here, then. Now.
I don't golf...
You'll leave -- ?
How's that?
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
You want to come along quiet?
I know you --
Right ...
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ...
What's wrong with it -- ?
What's this -- ?
Castlebeck.
You seem a little hinked-up ...
Where you been, anyway?
What for?
When'd you get to town, Raines?
Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today?
C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man --
Donny-nothin'!
Donny --
No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!
You mean the poor --
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
You ever feel bad about any of this?
We're partners here --
C'mon, man ...
So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ?
Yeah?
It's all microchips and shit ...
What's the matter?
That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...
Yeah.
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
Diane 1.
Good.
Got it ...
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
okay ...
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
I guess ...
What's that?
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
It just ain't happening --
Well, that defies the point, don't it?
Keys were in it ...
How'd it go?
Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...
What color?
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
What about him?
You guys have any skills at all?
Lookit Kip. All grown up...
I miss Orville Redenbacher already --
It's arright ...
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
We'll have to start beating the bushes, find out where they live...
Most of 'em are late-model...
Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
I think so too --
Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..
That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis?
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
There's no one left ...
Yeah...
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
How you know that?
We don't -- ?
What does that mean -- ?
Any word, Kip -- ?
How are we supposed to--
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
I know...
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
Tuesdays ...
The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...
Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
Of course ...
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
Atley Jackson. How is that one? How's the leg... ?
oh.
Have you seen him?
What are you doing back?
You look good...
You've been pre-booked...
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
Yes, sir -
Breakfast brunch -- ?
I know, sir ...
Oh, for God's sake
okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...
NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
What am I supposed to do?
I dunno ...
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
Sure -
You goin' home?
I'm cool -
Hey, Kip, what's up?
We can't do that, dude --
What are we gonna do -- ?
Run it...
Now what -- ?
What for -- ?
Things are all leafy and suburban ...
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
Call 'em here -- ?
It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are swapping trade secrets ...
For real?
Where we going -- ?
Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
You know of one -- ?
Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
You sure I can't go with ya?
Come on. Kip, talk to the guy
How come ... ?
What about me?
I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"...
I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.
So she flies -
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
Who's "Eleanor?"
Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
Yeah, I'm cool ...
Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...
Uh ... Randall -- ?
Not --
Not really --
Not really -
Shit all looks the same here --
Which way's out, man -- ?
Checkin' it out
What are you doing here, assface?
Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Why don't you leave him alone?
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
What do you want, shithead?
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
What? What happened?
Look at Jeannie's kid.
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We're only kidding. You can't take a joke? Come ooonn.
No more shines, Billy.
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
Son of a bitch. Get over here.
Billy, how are you?
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
You treated me like shit.
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
I warned you a million times.
Anybody!  You understand?
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
I don't want any more of that Shit.
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
No. No. The guy from downtown.
What did you hear about that thing?
What?
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
I want to talk to Jimmy.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
It's a fait accompli?
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
You're some fucking jerk.
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
What happened to you?
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
I gotta go home and get my hat.
I gotta go home.
Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Where'd you find such creeps?
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
No, no. It's okay.
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.
There's a shovel at my mother's.
Keep him here. I'm going for a bag.
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Okay?
I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...
Are you okay? What happened?
So do I.
I hate to do dishes.
Stay there.
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
Look. He's got the whole house in an uproar.
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
What kind of person doesn't call?
He didn't call?
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.
We'll pick it up.
We'll pack up everything and send it to you.
Please?
You want a partner?
What can I do? If I could do something, don't you think I would?
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
But, Paulie, please.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
No way! You're kiddin'!
Oh shit.
What? Come on!
Yeah.
I've been shit faced for like two weeks.
All right, then.
Oh, Morgan!
Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!
Least I work for a livin'.  Why'd you get fired?
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
Who's she talking to?
Will you take a check?
I have about seventy-three...
I don't think I...Larry?
You want us to give you cash right now?
Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.
I'm not sure--
There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...
Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
History? Just "history?" It must have been a survey course then.
How'd you like that course?
What class did you say that was?
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
That's one aspect of what we do.
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
You don't have to be nervous, Will.
Where is it touching you?
You're in a safe place, Will.
What is it?
And what do you see?
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
--But--
The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it.
Which one's your building?
No students work for me.
Yeah, can I help you?
Who proved the theorem.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
So who won the bet?
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
Yeah, cured polio.
Uh-oh.
Good to meet you.
What should I do?
Who is he?
What do you want to do?
I called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability.
Joe!
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
Listen, Smart Guy. I'll run my business my own way. I got work. If you wanta take it, okay. If not, just sit here, that's all.
'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
Well, I'm contracting the land.
You doin' the hirin'?
Be glad to get my han' on some cotton. That's the kin' a pickin' I understan'.
Twenty days work, oh boy!
Let 'er go, Gallagher!
Ready, Pa?
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
I never knowed they was anything like her!
Will ya look at her!
Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'?
She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride!
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
But ain't no reason--
How 'bout you?
Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
Watch me pass that Chevvy.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Ready, Ma?
But it ain't runnin' away, Ma. All I wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself--
I'd come back--
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
Now I can't breathe.
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
You're *ticklin' me!*
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
Don't hold me so tight.
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
She got to make it.
Gallon or two?
Fan-belt's shot.
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
Maybe the road's out.
Tom? You can come on. They gone.
Lots must a died, too.
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
Oh.
You bust outa jail, Tom?
Okay. Go on.
I didn't see nothin'.
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Short fella. Pale face.
What'd he look like again?
We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
I guess that's what he looked like.
You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?
Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
So long.
Them was nickel apiece candy.
What's it to you?
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
Cut me off a hunk a that banana cream, and a cuppa java.
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
Kinda pie y'got?
Okay. House 63. Wages 5 cents a box. No bruised fruit. Move along and go to work right away.
Can all of you work?
Kids?
Women?
How many men?
That's not your affair. Name.
Want to work?
Which way is House 25?
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
But--but how we gonna eat?
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Two and a half cents.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
House 25. Number's on the door.
We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
Deputy sheriffs.
Open up! We hear you got a riot.
I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.
But we can still do it, honey.
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
Women is always tar'd.
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
Want to work, do you?
Lissen, I heard that before--
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
I never asked you!
Yeah.
I didn't mean nothing.
You ain't got to get sore.
I stay in my own yard.
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
Get to what?
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
Been doin' a job?
Oh!
Lookin' for a job?
Goin' far?
Can't you see that sticker?
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
You people got a lotta nerve.
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
This here's a strike.
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
Yes, ma'am.
I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
What's he fixin' to do, ma?
Put somepin' over him, so he won't git sun-struck.  Ever'body set now?  Awright, Al, letta go!
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do.  And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California!  This here's my country. I b'long *here*.  It ain't no good--  --but it's mine.
Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute.
All but me! I'm a-stayin'.
But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.
I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
Take her with you!
Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
Where you think you're going?
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
Got any plants?
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
Where you going?
I got to get a lot curiouser than I am--with all them cops out there.
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
You take this.  I ain't hungry.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
I can't he'p it, Ma. It don't make *me* giggly an' happy.
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.
No'm.
I like the tent better.
We gonna live here?
Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us.
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
But will it--hurt the baby?
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.
Make her easy, John. Watch her.
Know where we're a-goin'?
That!
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
Jus' sassy, that's all.
I never *seen* her so sassy.  An' she ain't so young, neither!
Now don't get sassy, Ma.
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
How 'bout it?
Well, give me two then, ma'am.
Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for a penny.
There, them stripy ones.
Which ones?
Go ahead--Bert says take it.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
You can have this for ten cents.
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
You can't get no loaf a bread for a dime. We only got fifteen-cent loafs.
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
Yeah?
I don't think so. One come out here once an' I clipped him from behin' with a fence stake. They ain't bothered since.
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
You're *trespassin'*! It ain't you lan' no more! An' that's the supr'tendant--with a gun!
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
The rest of my fambly set out for the west--there wasn't nothin' to eat--but I couldn't leave. Somepin' wouldn't let me. So now I just wander around. Sleep wherever I am. I used to tell myself I was lookin' out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right. But I knowed that wan't true. There ain't nothin' to look out for. And ain't nobody comin' back. They're gone-- and me, I'm just an 'ol graveyard ghost--that's all in the world I am.
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
They come. They come and pushed me off.
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
Gone--  --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off.
They gone.
Tommy?
Well, I'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't *nobody* going to push me off *my* land! Grampa took up this land seventy years ago. My pa was born here. We was *all* born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. And that's what makes it ourn--bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on it--and not no piece of paper with writin' on it! So just come on and try to push me off!
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
Then who *do* we shoot?
It ain't nobody. It's a company.
Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?
Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
You mean get off my own land?
I can't help that. All I know is I got my orders. They told me to tell you you got to get off, and that's what I'm telling you.
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
No. I'm jus' gonna set awhile an' then go to bed.
You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back.
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.
How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
Here we go!
Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
That's Connie Rivers with her. They're married now.  She's due about three-four months.
Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense?
But what does *that* prove?
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
But what about this?
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
We gonna take whatever they got.
Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?
Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.
You do not see either!--not yet!
Heh'o Tom.  This is Connie, my husband.
I won't--  --if you won't tell what *I* done!
Please don't.
Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
Won't they ketch us?
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
It's them white things, made outa dish-stuff, like in the catalogues!
Whatsa matter?
Git up. I got sump'n to show you.
Some, I guess, but mos'ly cow bones.
Man bones?
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
I wisht it was day.
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
I never--
Now you done it! You busted it!
Now don't you go monk'ing--
What's this?
I seen 'em b'fore you did.
Jes' like in the catalogues, ain't they!
Well, I reckon you *stan'* in them little rooms--an' water come down outa that there little jigger up there--take a bath!
What's these?
Well, there's plenty of work for you about forty miles north, this road just outside Pixley. Turn east on 32 and look for Hooper's ranch. Tell 'em Spencer sent you.
Can you pick peaches?
You people looking for work?
Morning.
Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
You ain't to hurt them fellas.
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.
--No.
--Stop it--
You're so funny...
You do not.
What do you do?
Oh... really?
You don't...
You do not.
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
So, what are you doing now?
We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
Remember high school?
Not much, actually. My software company just went public so I'm just... hanging out, really.
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
Computer guy.
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
What?
Bob. Bob Destephano.
I want to be an actor.
What am I gonna do?
Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
Never better.
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
Really...? So what?
What?
Overflowing with love.
Jesus...
To make a long story short...
Insane.
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value.
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.
Yes.
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
And when you think of it, it's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it?
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
Because your problem is you're bored. And you have a very big mind.  I am part of what I call a brain syndicate.
I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you.
It's only natural....
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?
I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; they can't handle it.
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
Do you like the people you work with?
How was your day, today, sir?
The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.
Nope.
Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients.
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
Hello, Bob.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
See you in ten years.
Work's good for the soul.
That's too bad.
As long as you had a good time.
What the hell happened to you?
He gave me a great deal.
He sold me this bad boy.
Thank you.
Ten years. What happened!?
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
God it's great to see you.
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
You're leaving me hanging here...
Marty! It's me. Paul.
Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...
To shoot you. Correct.
Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.
That's good.
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
All right. Speak to you then.
If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?
Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
Did you speak to Farlow?
Who's there?
Either fight the way things are or accept it.
No. He had the choice.
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
We have a business manager. The best around.
Well, I know Peterson's. Old place is as good as falling down around your ears.
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
It isn't right to make him suffer...
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
I understand, but Annie, please...
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
Oh God, Annie, I'm so sorry. I... I know you're being hit with a low now, I don't want to take too much of your time but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim.
Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
Diane!
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
I believe women from New York eat mixed salads. Ain't that right, Tom?
Mixed salad.
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right.
Now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
Weekend after next...
When you figure on branding?
There was this thing on the TV about a guy who does it with geese. He has this airplane and these baby geese all grow up thinking it's their mom, and he flies it and they just follow.  You hear 'bout that, Uncle T?
That's what some folks say.
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him.
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?
We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
Tom?
You know her?
I wouldn't let happen.
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
Have you talked to Tom about it?
Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
I'm okay... I'm okay.
"... and I said that"...
We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
Why don't we just cut through the woods?
I just could never say it!
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
I thought your mom's coming up?
It's warmer than I thought.
You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!
You shut up, stupid!
You just showing off for her!
Don't be such a baby!
WAS SO!
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
IT WAS MY TURN!
Honey... I was always good.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Long enough.
What are you looking at, young man?
The number's by the phone.
Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.
Hey, darlin'.
What do you mean?
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
Where did you learn all this stuff?
Don't move!
Secret Service!
It's not cool. It's commie bullshit!
It's cool!
You think it's cool?
Yeah, cool.
Cool?
Now that's cool.
Listen to this bullshit.  "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
Alright sir.
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
How's it going, Ray?
How are you going to take care of the cops?
Hackers of the World, Unite!
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
She's rabid, but cute.
Waste the dude.
Let's keep her.
Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
Hack the Planet!
Welcome to our show!
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something.
Right.
Shh!
So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?
Yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
Oh yeah? What's that?
What's that?
What's that?
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Damn!
Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
...as they snoop onto us.
Snoop onto them...
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
Ta-da!
This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!
That's far out!
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
Looks like a hacker wrote it.
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Hold on a second!
Super hero like even.
Very impressive.
I want it.
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
Again?  Yeah sure.
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
Difficulty rating?
One-handed!
Yo, hit the lights.
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
I want it to have my children!
Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
I'm gonna hit you!
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
It was him, man!
Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
Roger.
Yeah?
Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?
Well this hasn't happened yet.
You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six.
Oh wow, we are fried.
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Dead?
Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!
Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  He isn't to consort with his computer friends.  The secret service is really out to get him.  Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
Curtis.
And unpack.
Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be home late.  And would you try and please fill these out?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
What did we learn in school today?
How was school?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
Up all night again, huh?
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday.
What are you doing?
Dade?
Yes!
Joey's getting stupid busy.
Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll take you ten minutes to get in, and you've still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the cops will have you in... five minutes.
They'll trace you like that  man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
Two days.
What's this one eat?
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
I got photographic memory.  It's a curse!  Lisa!
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
That's Razor and Blade.
Yo, showtime, showtime!
Never heard of you. Done anything?
212-555-4240.
Uhhhmm...
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.
What's up, man? I'm the Phreak!
So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual?
Sorry, I can't help you, okay?
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
You're welcome.
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
We caught 'em.
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.
I think we've got something.
Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. We'll release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc.
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I do?
There's a new virus in the database.
The rabbit is in the administration system.
We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
Uh, the accounting subdirectory in the Gibson is working really hard. We got one person online, the workload is enough for like ten users. I think we've got a hacker.
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
Mr. Belford?
I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
Yo, what's up?
Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that order, necessarily, right?
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
D'you bring those Crayola books?
Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.
I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...
What? whatwhatwhat?
Joey, Joey...
Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...
Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
Hey, it's me.
Any questions?
Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
Thank you.
Just one moment.
555-4202.
What number please?
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
Hello, operator services.
Nonono, thank YOU!
Thank you.
All right.
I'll take you down there.
Real charmer.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
You're late.
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
Purpose of visit?
Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
Yes, sir.
An accident?
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
When did this happen?
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
How do we look?
Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
Its too late.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Hang on Mrs. Pierce.  Not that tie, on the other side.  That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.
I'm not calling the fire department.
We should call the fire department.
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
Because the lights are all out.
How do you know their not?
Honey, I don't think their home.
Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
Why not?
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
Found it.
Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.
Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  Hello?
It's okay..it's okay.
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
Now where are you going?
Four plus Myers.
Why shouldn't I?
I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
I can see this is useless.
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
About what?
Drive Carefully.
Night Doc.
Yeah.  Well I guess your happy to see him go.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
Watch it.
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
Check him out.
Outside.
I do.
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
Has he been prepped?
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Yes.
Okay, out.
Got it Earl.
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?
You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers.
Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster.
Al here lost his boy 10 years back.
Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
What the hell did this?
No way. No how.
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
Who you calling?
Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.
Not like 'ol Ben Meeker do something like that.
All right.
That's all the windows, Dad.
Why?
Dad, what's going on?
Wise up to what men want Rachel, or Brady won't be the last man you lose to another woman.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
Hi Rachel.
Okay, bye.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
You won't come on too strong.
You won't look pushy.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.
Hi Jamie.
Do you?
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Where are you going?
Hell of a night.
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
Got it Ben.
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
What are we doing?
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Ben-uh-I just heard about the station.
132 to 133 this is 134.
No problem, Sheriff.
Right here, Ben.
Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede shoes. Would you like a drink?
Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name.
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
Car trouble?
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
Anything for a fellow pilgrim. Sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.  Reverend Jackson Pete Sayer of Dumon County, please to make your aquanauts.
Fun-ny. See you.
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Well, are we still on for tonight?
Sure.
It's been totally charted.
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
Yes.
I want to stay here and watch this.
I don't want to.
I don't know.
I'm scared.
You locked yourself in.
Annie, Paul's on the phone!
No, he's not.
Here, Lester.
YEAH?
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
Go get me a beer.
Yeah.
Is that all you say?
Yeah.
Want a beer?
Yeah.
Fantastic. Totally.
I can't. What if it's the Wallaces!? We'd get Annie in trouble.
Just answer the damn phone.
That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...
And I can't keep you interested?
I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
I wonder where they went.
Totally...
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
You idiot!
Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
Yeah.
Promise?
Yeah, sure.
Will you call me tomorrow?
I gotta go.
Michael's around someplace...
We're all alone, aren't we?
Are you sure?
My parents won't be back till ten.
Okay. Later.
Well, she's totally not here.
Is Annie around?
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Totally.
Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.
The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...
It's your own fault and I don't feel sorry for you.
TOTALLY!
It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!
You're coming with us...
I'm scared!
Let's make more popcorn.
Okay.
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
She's washing her clothes.
Will you get her for me?
Yes, she is.
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
Hello.
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
PROBABLY going.
There's nothing else I can do.
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
I've given them his profile.
I'm not responsible, Sam.
And maybe my lawyer.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
Hmm?
Right.
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
Mm-hm.
No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
Are you okay?  You look-- You're sweatin'. ELLIOT  Yeah.  Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air.  It's probably something I ate.  I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead.
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
Yeah, I got an Andy Warhol.  And I got a Frank Stella, too.  Oh, it's very beautiful.  Big, weird...you know.  If you stare at that Stella too long, the colors just seem to float. It's kinda weird.
How ya doin', man?
Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place, actually.  A lotta wall space.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there.
Well, are...are they big?
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
Hi.
...cannot go on the air.
Yes, but you name names.
...with the affiliates.
Child molestation is a touchy subject...
Ed Smythe, yes.
Oh, honey!
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
Always.
I am glad to see you.
Yeah.
And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
This is a toast.  You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all...
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.
How do you know?
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
So?
Why should I be afraid?
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
How can we be happy?
I'd have been a great dope addict.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
Hey!
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
...read it over, and think about it.
Take our literature...
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?

Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?

He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...

Starling...?
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
Shut up, Starling...
Well, then, you have insufficient information.  I'm grateful for this opportunity to set you straight.
I don't <u>think</u> so...
Your girl's a menace.  Here, givver <u>this</u>... Getter off the street and teach her some <u>humility</u>.
One moment, I'm not done with you...  Give him the file...
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
That could be.
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
I think its meaning is clear.
What is that supposed to mean...?
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?

Said what?
Gonna be fine.  You ask your momma.
You nervous...?
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>America</u>...
...how so?
Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
...should love to correct your error.
I have had many excellent meals there.
A wonderful country...
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
...yes, yes, yes...
Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
Back to <u>America</u>...?   When first we met you'd just returned from America.
Take mine.  Ah. And is that your <u>wife</u>...  Signora.  Can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...?
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor.
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
Enchante.

No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?

I'd prefer you to say what you feel.

...what has she done to harm you...?
...might I make a suggestion...?
The girl needs help.
...which of us is free...?
The girl could use some help.
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
<u>Yes</u>.
It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
...but will that satisfy you?

Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you.  Why dontcha gimme the gun?
Don't shoot yourself.
You goin to shoot yourself?
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?

She must be something special After Dark.
"A liaison position with the Opera."
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
When?
...yes...?
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
That's when you went to the Orphanage...
Because it's the game you've chosen. That's really all we have time for.
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
You want some <u>advice</u>.
...yes...?
That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
You said:  that you have "decided." That your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside.  And get on with your job.
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today...
Welcome to the human race.  Do you know, there are people who admire you?  Reasonable people.  Why don't you <u>find</u> them...?
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?"
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
...would you use a small word?
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
What does <u>that</u> mean?
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
Then what brings you back?
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
Then tell me.
Tell me why...?
That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
You think you're so...but you're just...
Stop it, stop it, you satanic whore!
Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
"Why?" If I asked questions like that, I'd never make love-"love"-- Damn you, Damn this, damnit!
Why are you...don't stop...why?
No really, keep talking, I ree-ally want to hear what you have to say, you're just so eloquent...
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...

I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte's Web. Good pig. Watch.
Believe me, I wish I knew less.  Oh, if you weren't such a pig...
You have no idea. Now run away.
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.
Did you wait until you were 18?
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.

Clever observation. Go back to Wichita.  Oh that's right, you can't.
Exactly. When we get into the clearing, I'll turn on my sexy moves. Wichita will go for it or he'll shoot me down.  Either way, you come away with knowledge.
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
Uh-huh.
You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning.
I didn't realize I had to declare a major.
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
Nothing.
Wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. The kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. We shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.

That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.
Sorry Veronica.
Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent.
How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.
Hey, don't run away now.
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
So, are you a cheerleader?
You did last night.
Like last night, Veronica?
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent.
Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?
Oh yeah, that's it.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Oh yeah, that's it.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.
So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
Uh-huh.
I don't get treated at all, but hey, don't worry about it. I'll do your thing. It'll give my Mom a smile.
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...
Is this turnout weak or what? I had <u>at least</u> seventy more people at my funeral.
Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?
Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
Monday morning, you're history. I'll tell everyone about tonight. Transfer to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson. No one at Westerburg's going to let you play their reindeer games.
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
You stupid cunt!
No. Hell no.
What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys.
Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.
Come on you jerk. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.
Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad.
If you're going to openly be a bitch....
Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
Sawyer. Guess what today is?
Don't think.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.
So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
Maybe when you hit maturity you'll understand the diff between a Remington University man like David and a Westerburg boy like Ram "Wham-bam- thank-you-maam" Sweeney.
King David.
Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.
He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
Color me nauseous.
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
Very very. The photographs?
But she couldn't handle it.
What do you want from me?
Where did you get these?
What are you doing?
Veronica, you look like hell.
Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
Jealous much?
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
Oh shit, yeah.
What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
That's the punchline. She's still alive, in stable condition. Another case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably. Is that pate?
Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.
Guess who?
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
Yeah, maybe.
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
Probably....
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
Suicide is a private thing.
Shit.
Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight, I'll never forget it.
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
No way, no day!
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
Lighten up, dude. In those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we don't even have to buy it a hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in!
Shut the fuck up, all right.
Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
Punch it in!
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
I think so, man.
Is it sleeping, dude?
Goddamn Geek!
Cool off, we're seniors.

That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.

What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
You going to eat this?
Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though.
Let's kick his ass.
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
Turn that back on!
How was the funeral?
You two....
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
You two....
Any contestants worth mentioning?
Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
What, the wine? I realize you're all under 21, but it seemed like such a perfect touch.  Could we get some more light up here?
Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!
Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share.
Sure. Ciao.
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
People just don't take the name Heather seriously. They should, shouldn't they?
I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
It rained everyday of my Maui vacation, but hey, I didn't kill myself. I'm Whitney James, Commentary.

Have we met?
Hello I'm Dr...
Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
How many zeros was your wife worth?
Zero's a number right?
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
What did you just say?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Good boy.  Where's is it?
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on?
YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?
And it shows. Least it did last night at the quarry. In a big way.
What's wrong, Trev?
How do you think you got this job, cock?  Mmm. I'm still tingling all over from our little midnight swim.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
We're all here for you Trevor.
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
I thought you loved games.
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
Okay then. Here's the scoop.
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.
A little? Try unbelievably.
Who the hell are you talking to?
Hey buddy!
Hey buddy!
Music to my ears.
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
Wow you are out of it.
Can you follow them?
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
We're just gonna take some blood here.
Do you know where you are?
You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
Use your mind for something other than numbers dear Trevor. Think about people for a change. People other than yourself. Like the women you slept with behind your wife's back. You were always so confident you had covered your tracks. Always confident your wife actually believed your fervent denials? Part of you must have known she would find out.
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
I hear everything. And soon you will know everything. More than you ever wanted I can guarantee that. But I want you to think for a minute first. Think about all you've seen. All the clues you've been given.
Poor Trevor.
Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:
All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
What things do you think you've done?
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
Are you ready?
You can trust me. Your wife is dead and you need to move past that. And the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it, not around it. Surrender yourself to your wife's death. Let it chew you up and spit you back out on the other side. It's the only way you can become whole again.
It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly?
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life.
Dreams?
WHAT?!
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
Well now there's a compliment.
It's getting hot in here.
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
God. Sometimes you can be such an animal. Other times you are the ultimate tease...
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
Really?
You okay?
YOU!
You.
Hey. Can I borrow something?
Hey even if it is more power to ya.  Alrighty then. Have a good time.
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
Mister LaPlante...
Mister LaPlante...
Mister LaPlante...
I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT! OUT!  OUT!
OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  Where's your other shoe? Never mind!  I don't want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy.
How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  He was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  Like you let everybody down, always!  What did you do, take a mudbath?
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
He waited for you three hours!
Uh, no.
Yeah, my dad's great.  He took me to the zoo.
Yeah.  I'll see ya... dad.
I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
Here.  Get off here.
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
What picture?
Were you in it?  In the war?
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
LaPlante!
This guy LaPlante won an award?
What is it?
What's the matter?
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
Yeah, I got it.  Sports training. You learn to follow the ball.  How about you do a wrap-up from up here?  I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.
How'd it go?
WHAT?  THEY FOUND WHAT?
We're piecing together different accounts and...
Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger...
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
That too.
She broke up with her boyfriend.  Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis.
You're sitting on your ticket.
Unprofessional.
For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
What?
Helluva story!
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
She can't quit.
Listen, Gale, I know you're emotionally involved.  Don't be emotionally involved, be professional.  No, Gale, you are not a hardbitten, cynical hard-ass, you just think you are.  You are a goddamn cream puff!  Try and be a hard-ass!
Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!
She's talking to him now.
Said he's not an actor.
Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never stop worrying.  I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background.
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
Not bad.  But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story.  Network's taking everything we give 'em.  They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not.  We're very big nationally.
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
Saving people is not our job.  It's as wrong to step in and save someone as it would be to push someone off.
He's right.  It's unprofessional.
Dad!
Oh my God!  Bernie!
It's when you say, "Everybody else cheats why shouldn't I?"  But I don't -- I don't <u>hate</u> -- him. I... loved him once, Joey.  Very much.  I just got... tired.  Maybe it wasn't all his fault.  He... What's happening?  Oh, my God...
What's "cynical"?
If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
I... I saw him out the window.
You were in bed.  Weren't you?
My father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here.
The "unknown hero."  They found his shoe right beside the plane crash.
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
He lost a shoe!
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?
Reporters don't have hormones?
You didn't... get it on with him?
Is he like that in real life?  So gorgeous?
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
Excuse me, Ms. Gayley.  That guy Inspector Dayton... he's recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants...
I didn't ask him.
Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you.  From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants you to call him.
Friend, that animal will go after whoever's approaching the sound of that whistle.  And God help whoever it is.  Because that dog will not let up until there's dead meat on the ground.  Put your faith in that, pal.
So this really does the trick, eh?
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
How are they with kids?
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- <u>nothing</u>.  I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>, they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle...  ... then look out.
Safety?
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
You test each one thoroughly?
What toys do you have?
Where are these toys of yours?
So where are all your toys?
Was that your dad?
Whoa, check it out.
They're really white.
I'm Bernard, by the way.  Those are cool Reeboks, Neil.  They're real new, aren't they?
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?
Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
Well, it's for a woman.
Any particular brand?
I'm looking for some perfume.
Are you being helped, sir?
There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --
I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
Right.
I should.
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.
-- a sense of proportion.
That would be stupid.
No, no, no, no.
I understand that.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
I guess so.  I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone.  I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever.
When I was a child... I got used to the closets.  The boxes.  The cabinet under the kitchen sink... with that persistent drip.  I used to the smell of the boxes. Wood.  Cardboard.  I got so I was comfortable there in the dark. Even... even that old refrigerator in the yard.  That smelled like rust and decay.  It was safe in the boxes.  It was when they took me out --
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
-- institution.
Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
Right.
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
About us.
I think we should talk first.
It is tomorrow.
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
What happened?
I was driving by -- I saw all the cars.  Are you all right?
Because you <u>were</u> pretty?
I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
It's a living.
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
Isn't that always the way?
Just show me the way.
Yeah, that was easy.
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
Sure.
Mommy!
"Hi. I'm Mr. Edgar!"  Look, Mommy, it doesn't even hurt him.
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
Did Daddy tease you?
Uh huh.
Why are you mad at each other?
Uh huh.
A man scared me.
I'm thirsty.
Bye, Neil!
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
I found a cent!
He'll never appreciate it more.
Don't drive yourself crazy.  It's probably nothing.
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
And?
Have you just plain asked him?
So you don't have anything concrete?
You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!
We must <u>always</u> count the husband. By my count there've been... four. But I still live in hope.
How large is your brood?
You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
Isn't it?
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
Put it out, man!
Grow up, Dreyer.
What for, dickweed?
Shut up.
Really?
Would you?
Promise.
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
Even better.
Is it a king or a queen?
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
You can believe what you want.  You saw the tape.
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
If he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby?
Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
No joke, Lieutenant.
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
You didn't see this.  Understand?
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
What do you think?
Talk to me about what?
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
Not now.  I'm busy.
So?
I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
Why?
I think it was England.
He had to come from somewhere.
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
Anything from the bank?
I don't need proof.  I know it.  Send it out.
We don't have any proof of that.
This ties in with Nash.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
Tough.
Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV.
I'd like you to see this.
That's not all, Lieutenant.  Wait until you see the tape.  It's unbelievable.
The guy had a sword and was dressed like this guy.
Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
What is it?
Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
Yeah -- how'd you know that?
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
It's circumstantial.
You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
What?
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
Get outta here.
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
You sure?
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
No.
She was a good woman.
And Brenda?
Where have you been for the last seven years?
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
Where were you last night around nine?
That's what I figured.  Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
When did you get back?
Lieutenant.
No -- after you.
You always get to go first.
I stood up first.
I'll go first.
Well?
The only thing you can do.  You must end it.
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
So, you do this for yourself?  What about her?  You cannot not have a relationship, Macleod.  You've told me of your wife, Heather, and how you loved her. Romeriz warned you then, but you would not listen.  You watched her grow old and die -- and there was nothing you could do.
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
You.
Yes.
She's the King's cousin.
You may be living -- but this suit is killing me.
What are we doing here?
Me?  Of course.
How long is the voyage?
The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
If it came down to it what would you do?
We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
I'm sure they will.
For what?
Then it's worth the journey.
And what do you think you will find in another land?
Leaving what?
I see.  You don't care about life anymore.
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
That's all?
What else?  What else do you hear right now?
Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
What?
You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
Indeed you did.  And now it is time for you to pass on to others what you learned from him.
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
You?
I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
Caution shows wisdom.
You'll have no need for that, Highlander.
How?
Agreed.
This cannot be.
I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
She'll soon be of age.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
What do you think?
It will be a good harvest this year.
I lied.
We had a bargain.  You promised.
How?
Your life.
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
How comes it your are not afraid?
Why are you doing this?
Then take me with you.
Do you love me, Conner?
Why?
Leaving?  For how long?
Why not?
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
The past?
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
What are you hoping to find inside?
Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
You stayed here again last night?
It has to be.
Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
What's that next to him?
How could they get by him?
What?  How?
Why?
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
Perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
I know.  I know-- you would not tell me.  Loyalty -- it really is a concept that eludes me.  Oh well -- I shall find him.  Time is on my side.
I do not know -- and even if I did...
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
You cannot hide from me.  You will not stand between me and my destiny. After I have your head the power will let me hold any form as long as I want.  Do you know what that means? I can become the President -- I can become anyone I want.  The world will be mine.
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.  I can wait a little longer.
The Kurgan was a pussy.
I am stronger than you, Highlander.
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
Me too.
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
Is there anything else you need?
I don't know.
How can that be?
No.
It isn't over, is it, Conner?
I can take care of myself.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
I know.
You know it's not safe here for you.
I'll no forget you.
I love you, Conner.
Don't leave us, Conner.
Would you care for some water, Conner?
If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.
You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
Why?
What will you do?
I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?
Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
What are you doing?
Yes.
Alright.  It's going to take a few minutes.  I have to call and verify the funds.
I can take care of myself.
This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
No.  The money, please.
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
I guess so.
Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.
Yes, sir.
The mother is in Florida visiting her sister.  The father works at home, so he's probably inside.
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
I think he's dead!
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
It was stolen.
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
I'll make the call.
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
I understand.
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
The best.
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
What do you want to do?
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
You wanted to let Sonny handle it.  I would've moved in when we first found out.
Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.
It's happening right now.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
Bullshit--a man will do anything to save his family.  Who's running the show up there?
He knows better than that.
Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
You should warn them, Sonny.
I took the call from Glen personally. They're still in Smith's house.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
No way.  I tell them, that Old Man is gonna handle this from back there.
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
I guess not.
You think we should take that chance?
Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
You won't die if you let me help.
I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
I'm going to my desk.
The car.  All you want is the car?
Who sent you?
Jen?  Are you all right?
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
What about my father?
I'm getting a doctor!
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
He needs a doctor.
My father.
I don't know.
I overheard him with the girl.
I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
Dennis.
They'll cut the power.
I got the gasoline --
Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
You can't run with suitcases.
We're trapped in a house.
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --
Keeps to himself, more like.
That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.
You fucked up, Glen.
Are you out of your mind?
I don't eat junk food.
Donuts here any good?
We have to own this guy, Marion.  We don't want him dead; we need to use him.
Okey-doke.
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
It won't be a problem.
Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.
Canyon Country.
What hospital?
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking him to the hospital.
You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
What do you mean?
What if it goes south?
An hour, tops.  Might be sooner.
Give me an ETA.
L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.
You'd better be kidding.
If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them?
All right.  Now the second one.
Where is it?
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
You got ten minutes.  If you're one minute late, we won't be here to find.
Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
What do you want?
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
How did you get this number?
That's okay.  I love you anyway.
I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
You sure?
But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
We'll see you in a couple of hours.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
Better than you getting killed!  Don't touch that gun!  Daddy says --
You leave that gun alone!
Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help the police!
You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
No!  I'm not going to leave Daddy with them!
Mine, too.
No one's coming.
Ow!  Shit!
Stop it.
Now we can do whatever we want.
Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's coming back!
I don't know what you're talking about.
Kevin left without you.
How about dog shit?
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
What?
We can't make the microwave work.
What do you want?
What I want is to help my father.
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
I don't drink beer.
Want one?
Yes.
How can we get out?
I can't go without Thomas.
What happened?
What do you want?
If my father dies they'll charge you with his murder.  Can't you make Dennis see that?
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
Thanks for the shirt.
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
Please get away from me.
What's going on?
What are we going to do about Mike?
He said something about a girl --
That's enough.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
He.  Can't.  Answer.
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
What are you doing?!  Stop that!
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
She didn't answer.
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
Chief, base.
I know the one.
Go, Chief.
Go, Chief.
We only have eight officers on duty, Chief.
I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
He didn't say.
Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
Yes, sir.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
Chief, Mikkelson.
It's right in front of us.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
Where's the office?
They've been in there all day.
Not until the man calls.
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
Think of me that way and you won't fuck up.  I'll handle the Sheriffs.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
What's my name?
Don't worry about what we used to be.
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it.
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
Did you find the disks?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Where are my children?
Smith will know.
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
These guys are going to take hold of you. Don't freak out.  It's for your own good.
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
Where's your gun?
You don't want another dead child on your conscience.
We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A.
My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
I guess we each have something the other wants.
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
A delegation.
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
Paul, Paul, a moment please.
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Cockroaches?
Paul!
What was the response?
Have you requested re-enforcements?
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
Take the river road back. It is clear.
Why not? We are half way there already.
Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar.
I am always glad to see you Paul.
Business is good at the hotel?
Politics is power, Paul. And money.
Youre drunk.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Lets go, Jock.
Fuck you.
Here, have a sandwich.
Oh my God!
You fucking see that!
What is it?
Holy shit! Holy shit.
Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
Satellite feed.
We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
Were not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That's the ground rules.
For fuck's sake, Gloria There's a big news story out there! We need to get out and cover it.
Very soon.
The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force.
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
Great, I really need a shower.
I saw the sign.
The fog is too heavy, sir.
Where are we going, sir?
Please, except my humblest apologies...
Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Mr. Manager.
There are no more rooms.
Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.
Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.
Perfect timing.
Can we phone them in, Paul?
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
Good for you.  We're having a little trouble, Paul. We booked five rooms, but...
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
I will remember that name.  Let's go.
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
Who did you call?
You don't have time. If I do not have the names, so that I can pick out the traitors, then I will kill everyone here in this car park. Get in there now.
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
You are the manager?
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
One thousand francs.
No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
What cards?
What?
Show me your ID
The commander is not here.
What do you want?
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
I will see what I can do.
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
This time the Militia will kill us.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
The third floor are low class rooms.
Move? Where to?
I will need a suite.
I can give you many political answers Paul but the truth is that Africa is not worth a single vote to all of them: French, British, Americans.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
Yes, Paul, I remember. The Mille Collines is a very important property for Sabena. Our directors believe we should close down, shutter the place until this unrest is over?
Can I have your name again?
It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
As the trucks go.
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
Thank you, sir.
Many beers.
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
The lieutenant wants the register.
What do we do with all these people?
Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
He has taken the presidential suite.
Twelve are dead.
Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
You have taken business class?
That is why they call it coach?
What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
Rutaganda's place?
Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
Paul, if you have one call in all the world to stop this, who would you call?
Paul, are you there?
The staff and guests! How many?
All. What do you mean all?
Out? Where are you going?
Paul. Are you alright?
On the street.
There are soldiers.
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
I don't know.
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
I hope not.
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
The guy whose hair I do has his own TV show. All I've got is a blow-dryer and a dream.
I knew this whole place'd be pure gold! Pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! If I can get something bizarre enough on tape, I think I can parlay it into getting me some kind'a Robert Stack "Unsolved Most- Wacked-Out Home Videos" gig. No more five afternoons a week of sex-change- Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em.
So where's the party?
Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
And here's your goddamn severance!
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
You think this is fucking funny??
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
You didn't think to ask?
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
Please! Something! Oh-God!
Do something!
First time for everything.
Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment?
And then what happens?
Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
-- it wasn't me.
The lockdown thing.
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
-- something horrible...I don't understand --
Something....happened --
Sara...?
For the love of God....please...?
Please.....anyone....help me?
Over here.
The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
We don't have proof of that.
It might have been her mother.
So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?
Colleen.
What was her name?
It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
I did a cross search, death certificates with this address. James and Marion Foster.  They had a daughter.  Right here, it says James died, 1882, pneumonia. Marion dies September the next year. Suicide.
Did you find something?
These records only go back to 1880. But...  ...wait a minute...
What's the matter?
Damn it.
You say you saw some activity here?
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
Good-bye.
There's no need to be.
It will heal.
A few years older, perhaps.
Did you find her?!
It looks delicious...
Yes.  It was.
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
No, I live about in Wexford.  It's about a five hour drive.
I have to admit you really have a beautiful home.
I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously.  And who died here.
Town records are coming up now.
They don't build them like this anymore.
What do these ingredients mean?
I don't understand.
By killing them?
Where does this amulet come from?
That poor little girl.
My God, I heard something!
Take me to her.
Where is she now?
Where is she?
White meat will be fine...
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
Maura.
You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
I could see if I detect the presence of something.
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
I don't know!  Trust what I'm saying, we have to open this wall!
There's something through that wall!
There's something in there.
Do you mind if I borrow it?
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
Where did you find this?
Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
Not someone.  Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.
Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
Not on station time.
And I believe what you say.  But this is TV.  No pictures, no story.
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
Your apartment.
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage.
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
Something bad.
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true.  Will you walk with me a while?
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
You gonna buy?
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
I took back everything bought on a whim, I'd have no business.  I ...
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
Right.  Like you were hog-tied or something.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
Unh-unh.
No.  Thank you.
Yes really.
... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Welcome. 38
It has already begun.
How do we start?
God?  My God was diamond and black light.  And I was his Dark Pope.  All that is changed.  A terrible beauty is born.  With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes.
But how in God's name ...
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
Hey, that's what makes the world go round.
A dark star rising.  I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed.  A friend relieved me of that inconvenience.  Now I'm free.  Born again of Blood and Desire.
Because you want to.  You've always wanted to.  Look at your pictures.  Look at your sculptures.  Look at those tawdry representations and then ... Imagine.  Imagine a world of the body as canvas.  The body as clay.  Your will and mine as the brush and the knife. Oh, I have such sights to show you.
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
Fuck you!
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
No!  No.  It's not the same ... I ... No.  What you did ... it was ... evil.
Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
Yes.
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
What ... What ... ?
Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this.
That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
C'mon.  It'll be great.
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
Really?
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
Not quite.
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
How.
Welcome back to Vinci.
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
Welcome to Rome, sir.
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...
Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....
Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.
Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?
I call them the MTV.I.A.  Punks think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea. They think the Cold War involves penguins and...
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
Don't you just hate kids...
You're supposed to be dead!
What the hell....
Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...
This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
Quit bitching, you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is and in love.
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
Actually we're in Italy, Snickers, she said as if it made a difference.
Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France, you gotta have French.....
God go with you, sister.
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
"Messed around" messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm...
Anna, what are you trying to say...
Hit me with your best shot.
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
Did he mention the Mayflowers?
Actually he never told us what it was.
Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  If that were true, Almond Joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the Codex. Now, get some sleep.  Kit Kat...
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
And then we'll arrest those greedy pigs... Is that it?
Way to go, Anna.
Good job, not pretty, but good.
What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.  Easy as my brother's wife.  Directions are in the bag.  Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...
How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."
Million five, lover...
That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A million?
I knew it!  I told you it was a fake.
So let's get busy.  Have some fun and make some deals.
We're here to say, your government was right.
I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.
So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.
I don't care.
No, let me!
Like a "cat", one could say.
Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.
Bunny, ball-ball!  Bad bunny!
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
What a pleasant surprise.  You're probably wondering...
I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
Because I didn't want to get hurt, taterhead.
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
That's the beauty.  It's bullshit, but I can make it stick because I'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con.
Remember that shoe you lost...
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
I killed some lovable working class Italian-diabetic, but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind, gentle lover.  So don't play with me.
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me?"  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!
Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
Big girls don't cry-I-eye.
Get away from there, convict!
You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
For God's sake, chain this convict.
Too bad.
Bastard!  If you were a true American.
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.
Tell me about it...
I can't believe this.  I'm in fucking Russia, or do I have to say, the fucking Soviet Union and I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.  I never thought I'd say "I'm just in this job for the money."  Sad. Any last immature quips?
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
God, I miss communism.  The Red Threat.  People were scared, the Agency was respected, and I got laid every night.
Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
Shucks.  Guess not.
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
The Hudsucker Hoop!

Snappy.

Something short.
The Jerky Circle!
The Dancing Dingus!
We'll call it the Flying Donut!
Cheap! Cheap! It's never been more valuable! And I'm ruined! Ruined!
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
He didn't look unhappy!
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?
...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh?
'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does...
But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
-- and she's dynamite!
Ol' satchel-butt...
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
He didn't offer you money.
About seven minutes.
Yeah.
Adenoids?
Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
Sez who?
Phony, huh?
Amy -- take a break. You've worked hard on this story -- heck, you broke it for us! But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack.
Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
He grins wolfishly.
Watch it, Archer --
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel!
I can't print this!
Forty-eight years...
Nooo, I don't guess you will be.
Terrific.
I'm sure you do.
Tell me about it.
Terrific.
Martinis are for squares, man.
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
...Geez.
...Geez.
This you're familia' with.
This I know, Benny.
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
What the heck they doin'?
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
...Yeah, go ahead.
-- tough titty toenails!
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
Well, why don't ya read it.
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile.
Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?
I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
Yeah?
Well, frankly, I...
Sidney and I are planning a trip to Paris and points continental -- Aren't we, dear?
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I was in bed for a week! Positively sick with fury! I called in the gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez, either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee!
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
She's damn good, Lou.
She's good, Bennie.
She is!
She isn't!
He don't look wise.
Maybe he's wise.
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
...adenoids.
...Her mother needs an operation...
She's got other problems, of course...
He notices.
Hello, Niagara.
Old Faithful.
Yellowstone.
Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
He don't look wise.
Maybe he's wise.
...He's not noticing, Benny.
The mark notices.
...No money.
She looks in her purse...
...and awduhs a light lunch.
She sits down.
She finds him.
She's looking for her mark.
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
There's one in every story.
...Enter the dame.
Fah from it...
Ya get the special?
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
Yeah, tell me about it.
I got gas, Bennie.
If you say, miss.  If you say.
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
I've never heard of a cure.
I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
That's rather nice, isn't it?
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
Where were you trained?
You're single?
You were possessed.  That is true -- possessed by your subconscious mind.  You were in the Houmfort, surrounded by their symbols.  To them, nothing worse can happen to a person than to be made into a Zombie.  Your subconscious mind used their own words for evil.
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right.  And I will have to urge him to use it.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.  And you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence.  There is no such thing as a Zombie.  The dead do not come back to life. Death is final.
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
Why?
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
No.  You're quite wrong.  Right here's the seat of the trouble. Mrs. Holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people.  It's revived all their old superstitions -- Zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.
In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm a free agent tonight.
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
Yeah, good.
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!
Benjie!
Right o'.
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
A prior engagement overcame me.
What are you talking about?
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
Birth control.
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
In a bit.
Here.
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
Ben--
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions.
And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?
It was lovely!
You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic.
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.
Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here.
You okay?
Of course.
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
You want coffee or something?
Somehow it was different in my imagination when I thought about it. Actually, I didn't think about it at all, really.
Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
None at all. I'll leave it in front of your garage. Happy Thanksgiving.
Here you are.
You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
Educated guess.
Social work?
It's not like we're too busy.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
It's really quite all right.
I insist.  Don't touch them.
Please don't.
Let's see!
No candy for me?
Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
Major.
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
Just be careful.
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
Jesus, Jim!
Play with the whip.
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
Would it matter?  And what's that?
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.
Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm so wasted.
I do.
And I have a feeling for you too, because you're just like -- I feel for you like you're -- you're just like --
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
My what?
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
Yeah.
Thanks for the advice dad.
What is it?
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
Great, thanks for the tip.
The Idiot?
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that means the molecules are not moving. So when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped. So it's clean.
Out.
I'm not good at math. Just geometry.
Sure, anything but this English.
Yeah?
I don't have a girlfriend.
Who said so?
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
You get in trouble?
You're parents at that party?
4:30 movie. When Worlds Collide.
When worlds collide.
Wendy!
You like him? He worships you.
Why did you -- with Sandy?
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
There's a TV in the basement.
See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?
I dunno. I --
I don't ever want to see you.
Tell Sandy? What?
I'm chewing.
Want some gum?
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
That's all, for now.
Too bad...
It's only gonna make you crazy.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
What's the D.A. got them on?
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
What's that, then?
We'll get the other one, though.
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
What I saw?
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
Sorry about...
This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out.
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
And something else that might interest you.
I beeped you over two hours ago.
Forget your pager?
I'll call him now.
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
What are you doing here?
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
Has her books in it.
Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
Around twelve-thirty.
She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
Like I said, no.  We know about those things up here.
No.
Are you sure about that?
Randy Stetz?
How do you mean?
Did she?
What happened at that signing?
Where you signed this?
What if someone finds out?
Will.
One of your cases?
There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise.  Says he can't sleep.
Will...I...
That's not what he thinks.
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
Your friend's all business.
Thought I smelled something.
She didn't tell me.
I don't know.
Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions...
How should I know?...
I told you I don't remember.
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
Stuff.
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
Huh?
Huh?
Yes!
My daughter...
A child who can't die...
Yes.
Yes...
Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
I'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts.  All we can do now is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter.
Sorry. Emergencies only.
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites.
You're in 201 and 202.
What can I do for you?
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
Who? Who is here?
It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
The guy looks dead.
No.
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
No way, man. Surprise her. She'll be psyched.
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
Stupid. Stupid.
Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones.
There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out.
That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
Get lost, you scared me.
Checking the locks again?
It's gonna be great.
Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
This weekend?
What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
I understand something.
Can't what?
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Yeah.
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
Don't kill me --
You never do...The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to you. How do we even know you're not the one behind this --
You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
I told you.
Who?
Fine. Show me the body.
That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise.  Wanna dance?
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
I don't know, but I'm starving.
I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
I'll come with you.
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
See any dead bodies out there? Any fresh kill? How 'bout Freddy, Jason?
Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.
I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
Hello?
Why?
Pretty cool bar.
Guess the capital of Brazil --
Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
Is there a problem here?
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
I'll talk real slow.
Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you.
You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.
We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
How much?
Well, there's some flaws in her...
How much?
Jeez, that's a full carat --
Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up.  I've never seen a dead body before.
Must have missed the sign.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
And so could you -- crazy fool.
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
The rest of us see bathrobes.
Cool.
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
What's going on?
No. I shot him.
He leave you?
Not anymore.
What's the matter, boy trouble?
Wanna drink?
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
You guys lost?
What is up with that weirdo?
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
They were cut loose.
Take this.
Hey -- shut up, okay?
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
Where is everybody?
I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
Crowded.
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
Can't talk right now.
Where is Miss Wollsten?
The Greeks thought death was beautiful -- an adventure --a journey to another world.  But I have my other guests to think of -- The General will be wanting to go back to his army. If you'll excuse me --
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece - the dancing, the singing and the white marble --
May life be good to you both. As for the others  they will be quiet here  and I will be with them.
Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
In case you do so, would you --
Or even spirit messages from the next world.
That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently  walked blindly.
He's dead. I want the General to see him.
I need your advice  something has happened  Mr.  Jacks 
Why don't you stay here tonight? Get a good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.
But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.
It is my home.  My name is Hugo Albrecht.
I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
You can have your servants prepare a dinner. That is the way I'll meet my old- familiar enemy -- Death --I have fought him before. I've won often. Now he wins. Let him come for me at my own banquet.
My friend -- what can one say --
) You feel the symptoms?
I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
We will see who is the first to die.
Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
You're just talking nonsense.
I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do --
The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --
Good winds and bad winds!
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
Maybe you're right. Help me get something to carry her downstairs.
No.  She shall not be left here.
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
Did your servant got word to Dr. Drossos?
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
In the meantime it would be useless to alarm the others.  Let them think it was a normal  And, perhaps it was - perhaps it was.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
I donut understand.
I'm afraid so. There were rumors people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
All the graves?
There was some trouble here the villagers on the mainland -this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
But why?
They were gore before I came here.
The enemy is in retreat. There will be no more fighting here.  I came here to visit the crypts. My wife was buried here. What happened to the bodies?
This was once a cemetery.
I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
They shall not hurt you
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then - I'll not die  I'll watch - they shall not hurt you.
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill  or frightened.
I was looking for you.
How old is she?
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
You wouldn't tell that 
You'd do anything to get Oliver away from Thea. But I'm going to stop you. I'm going to tell Mr. Davis exactly what you are.
You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man   working at him   turning him against Thea.
I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours  but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.
That your father and I 
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you - I'll warn them against you.
) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints  the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life you've ruined mine 
Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.
You and your mysterious illness. A new attack everytime you are crossed  everytime you can't get your own way.
They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are  a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.
I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure - quite sure.
I don't understand you.
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep - I want to avoid it.
Yes?
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
He's dead enough. God rest his soul.
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed  imprisoned..
Woman, what are you doing here?
I don't care who he is. He doesn't know.	He can't tell 
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
I will go with you.
This girl -- Thea - is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
This girl --
Why -- no not before Thea came 
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
What is her illness?
She's not too well.
Your daughter is ill.
Miss Wollsten - my secretary, she'd know.
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
Damn me, if I know. She's become so much a member of our household I never think of her by any name but Thea -- she has a last name --
Her family name?
Theodosia.
Her name is Thea?
I don't really know where Thea comes from. The ViceConsul at Adrianople brought her to me..
Daughter -- my daughter --
Theodosia --
I shall not leave the island 
I have had command for the last time -
Listen to what I say --
If I told you  you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you  the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -
You are my friend.
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
I don' t know. When I was gone the people from her village came to my home seeking vengeance. They bore her away with them. Months later she came back pale -- sick -- she died --
She was beautiful. There was blood between her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me.
Thea is so like her  in every feature 
Dr. Drossos will tell us. We will know what to do then.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
I've seen men die drunk - and I've seen men die of the plague.
We have no time for that.
It is not necessary to understand. We are leaving and I am thankful.
It makes me fear her.
I know all you are going to say -I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves  the way she turns her head.
There is something evil about her.
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl 
You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in - the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me  a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
She is not there. The coffin is gone.
There's no one there - nothing but the caves and the dead.
You were at those battles as a spectator   I wonder if you can think what that sound might mean to me  those men out there  dead or dying  by my order -- because I willed it so.
You know that sound, Oliver?
Hero?
So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family  no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
Well, all right . . .
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
But they're somebody's children.
I can't do that. These families have children.
Then foreclose!
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
All I'm asking is thirty days more . . .
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
I'm hurrying.
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
All right  all right.
Get that ladder up here.
The groom, idiot. Come on, get that ladder.
Who?
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
Sure I have, but I got rid of it.
How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?
I hate to do this, fella.
Stand back.
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
George . . .
Yeah, very funny.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Merry Christmas.
Carter  bank examiner.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
What's that book you've got there?
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
I know. I know.
They went out of business years ago.
The Building and what?
You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting  to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.
I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.
Well, this house ain't been lived in for twenty years.
Is this the place?
Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . And I ain't never seen you before in my life.
All right.
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Bert, the cop, sent this over. He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles.
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
Hiya, George!
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child  simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
Oh  Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
Hello, Joseph, trouble?
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
When'd you see him last?
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
Mother? What do you want?
Well?
Fine.
Daddy!
It will?
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
What?
Give the flower a drink.
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
Want to give my flower a drink.
I won a flower.
Hi, Daddy.
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along.
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
We just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then we're going to drive on down to Florida.
Hee-haw!
Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
A cattle boat?
What boat you sailing on?
No charge.
I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?
Please don't go away  please!
Oh, no  you don't feel so good.
Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?
He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
Goodbye, everybody!
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
Oh, George!
Uh-huh.
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
No.
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Hmmm?
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Oh, stop that grunting.
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
Nice girl, Mary.
Came back three days ago.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
No. No.
Hope you enjoy it.
Aw, forget it.
Oh, George.
No . . . No . . . No. . .
Aw, get going!
Yes  charge.
Ummmm . . .
No.
No.
You're not paid to be a canary.
George! George!
What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox.  Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here!
That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
Okay.  What's yours?
You want a martini?
Yes, you bet.
Have a good time, son.
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
I know it's soon to talk about it.
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
Maybe you were born older, George.
He's pretty young for that job.
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and sick. Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. Hates us mostly, I guess.
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
Hello, George, how are you?
Oh, wait. Wait . . . Wait a minute.
Say, where's Mother?
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
Very funny. Very funny.
Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life.
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
Do me a favor, will you, George?
George.
I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
Yeah  yeah . . . sure I will.
I know, but . . .
No, George, don't . . .
George, can I see you for a second?
Huh?
Where are you going?
What gives?
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.
Hello, what am I bid?
Hey, George . . .
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
She was here first.
Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?
Well, what about all your other friends?
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
What is it  a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
Have you notified the police?
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
You like it? I'll send you a box.
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .
They're not my children.
Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
Well, now listen. I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear? And George, I may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary . . . Mary . . .
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. He's going to build a factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that?
I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
What plates?
Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
I don't care. It's George's tux.
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
I've eaten.
Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down and have dinner.
How about that one there?
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
You forgot something.
I guess you forgot something.
I'm supposed to.
Sure you do -- you win either way.
But of course.
I can't wait to get there.
Soon, dark eyes, soon.
When do we get to the lighthouse?
So's mine.
My hair's getting wet!
I want to go faster!
How fast is enough?
Wheee!  Faster!
With butter, if they got any....
Great!  Find one for me.
What the hell.  For you....
For me...?
Well, I don't know....
Come on, you guys.
You going to the lighthouse?
You can?
What?
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
How fast does this go?
Swim for it!
Get on the rocks!
Back down!
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
Stop paddling!
Don't!
I think we're changing course a little.
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
It's okay, it's okay....
I can't help it  it sticks in my mind.
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
No problem, no problem.
Someone pop your balloon?
Oh, shit.
Putz -- that won't be for hours.
It's not going to be easy.
Your dad must be really pissed.
Turkeys!  Eat wind!
Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you.
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
Then why are we futzing around the dock?  We can make a few bucks working at the beach.
If you're beached, why are we doing this?  For practice?
Maybe by now they are.
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.
Good.  It's terrible.
Is she responsible for the punch?
We're hung up on something.
What is it?
Too hot in the lighthouse?
Why'd they decide to move?
No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
The lighthouse?
Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.
Mostly old garbage.  Today we found a '48 Hudson.
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
What the hell.  Did your mom put all this together?
That's awful.
They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.
The Shark.
But the island!
Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear?
Listen to Andy, Sean.
Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?
Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse.
Where're we going?
What the hell, we're steering for it.
I don't know.
Sean!  Catch it!
Throw it.
There's a shark....
As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in.  My dad's the mayor....
You're betting what you already got.
Loser sails home alone.
Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
Coming up!  Give way!
We'll take your supercargo.
We're carrying weight.
Can you get us a line?
We're hung up here.  Snagged.
The rope!  The rope!
Sean!   Catch the rope!
Over here!
Hey!
Anyone got another set of sails?
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
You bet.  Hang on....
You coming up on him?
Want to swim home?
Want to talk about it?
Let's just go sailing, okay?
I thought you said she was going with us?
Gangway, Turkies!
Coming up!
It's still there!
No!  It's still there!
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?
Okay, okay -- stand over there....
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny thing.  You can't tell much from the negatives, I was going to blow 'em up.  Here's a test I did....
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....
1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
That's what he said.
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
That's it?
What for?
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
They made me go with them.
Dad!  Dad!
Hi Dad.
Can I go with you today?
What's daddy doing?
Can I go swimming?
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
It's all right, we're okay.
We're going to die.
Shh.  Shhh....
It killed her.  It ate her.
Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
What's wrong?
Oh, yeah.  So why aren't they doing it now?
I told you, remember?
You going to fool around with Mike?  Well, I'm not doing anything with him.
Now I really want to see it.
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
I've never been supercargo.
That's you.
Is that me?
Mike!  Are you going out?
She just likes to tease.  I think she really likes you.
I want you to meet my cousin.
You're not going out right away, are you?
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
Okay, okay, coming....
Help!  Help!
Terry!  You okay?
Hang on, hang on...Okay, go.
Ready?
Whoops, almost lost one.  Can't play with the dolphins without skis....
Great!
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
Did you ever see a dolphin?
Gaff rigged?  Why not a staysail schooner?  Go anywhere.  Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner.
That's what I want -- a gaff rig.
None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
No class.
I know.
That's a crock of shit.
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
Tina Wilcox.
Who'd you ask?
Me neither.
Nope.
Get a dance yet?
Sideways -  For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way....
What's that mean?
The wind drift is lateral.
I can't stop thinking!
Shut up.
By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out.  More, with this wind.
They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
Maybe it's gone.
3:30.
Anyone know what time it is?
You got it.
That you'll put down a blanket.  I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them.
Anything.  Anything.
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
Mmmmmm.
And second?
But first, a little juice....
I dunno.  We'll think of something.
What're we going to do in the mean time?
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
What about the others?
It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful.
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
What about sailing?
Just like this.
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
Double nope!
Give me back my hat!
Nope.
Come on back up here!
With you, everything's next week. I want to go skiing soon.  Tomorrow?
Next week.
Eddie, can we do that?  Can we go skiing?  We can use my Uncle's boat.  Eddie?
Huh?
Take a break for a minute, okay?
Now you're talking.  Let's get out of here before we do find something.
It comes here from Cable Junction.
Power line.
About damn time.
I don't care about the overtime, I'm hungry.  And cold.  And most of all, bored.
How much longer?
Figure they split?
What's wrong?
I love it.
That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!
I thought you were grounded.
Good.  I'll be on the dock at eight.  Eight o'clock, everybody!
You do everything your parents tell you?
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
It'll be fun, come on!
I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
Is there something I don't know about?
Great.  I got some wine.
What's the lighthouse?
Sean, baby, please....
He's got to help or it won't work.
Might as well.
Heading back?
Your ass I will.  Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch.
Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
What about me?
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
Coming about....
Faster!  Faster!
Coming about, then.
They're turning around.
Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
Who wouldn't.
You going with Patrick?
Not tonight.
When are we going out?  You and me?
I don't think she's such hot stuff.
Yeah.
I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?
Michael....
I want to go with you!
Take me.
You're going sailing.
You're going out.
You eat Cheerios.  I want Fruit Loops.
I want Fruit Loops!
Do I have to play with the little kids?
You always go with Andy.
Don't feel bad.
It hasn't adjusted.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
We're ready for you.
And Philip will be there to film it.  Now that's the end of it!
He's going with you, Doctor.
Absolutely.  Good idea.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
Go on, Doctor.
What's your plan, Brody?
What you're saying is we have a Great White shark in the lagoon.
I know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  So you better start.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
Shit.
Yeah.  Down there.
You see the three-quarter socket?
Coming with us?  Overman's buying.
Sure am.
You buying?
It's Miller time!
Me?  I don't know.  Twenty, thirty.  I love them, think they're the greatest.
Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
Well, don't worry about your fiancee.  We'll watch over her.
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
We got it to live for ten hours. That's some kind of record.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
Don't blame yourself.
Ten minutes ago.
He's a young one.
They still seem nervous.
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
Don't you dare.
Now what?
Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
I am serious.
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
I thought I was your boyfriend.
What're you doing later?
The space shuttle has landed!
It's disappeared.
Yes, there is goes.
That?
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
What?
Did you see that?
We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island.
Right, Mike.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
It's not closing, Mike.
You want to show this?
I wouldn't mind going down with her.
That bugger moves fast.
It's time for tea, Grandma.
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
Can I make sandwiches...?
My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
Was Uncle Sean ever bad?  Did you ever spank him?
I don't want to.  I want to swing....
Daddy, why can't I...?
But you always let me....
Watch me, Grandma....
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
That's what grandmas are for.
I hope the man knows what he's doing....
They won't kill it....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....
Spent it all on beer....
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
I won't....
A big one....
Good.
Ask the big doctor about his work.  Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day....
You check it....
We don't want any....
Adds flavor....
I'm hungry, Mom....
Can't help myself....
That hurt....
I'm not doing anything.
Stop what?
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
Good night, Daddy....
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
I didn't.
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
It's not nice to be evasive.
Who's coming?
You're silly....
I'm still five....
Mommy lets me....
I like Grandma's cooking....
Where's the lady who brings the soda?
Can I ride one sometime...?
You can stay in my room.
What's going on?
Yes I can....
Hurry!
I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
You're the man who drives the plane.
I do....
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
I'm too young for coffee.  Can I drive the plane?
They had them on the big one....
You too, Michael....
Let me speak to Ellen....
Feathers all over the place....
Oh, boy....
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
She's a tough lady....
How's Ellen?
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
Still tagging conch?
Yeah....
I don't know what the hell to say....
Tell Thea I'm sorry....
When he has a pillow over his head....
I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
I'm training to....
I'm not going to marry you until you straighten out your life and your hair.
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
Oh, Jake...
I told you....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
Here it comes....
In a few minutes....
Don't flatter yourself....
Deputy Brody will take care of it personally.
I'll take care of it.
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
Cow tipping?
Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.
Where's Lenny?
Good night, Polly....
That man keeps calling about his training film.  I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.
Anything to do before I go home?
You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....
We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
That bad, huh?
Well, with me, it's all right. I'll kiss you and hug you. You see if I don't.  Now Mama, Mama, stop now. You're gettin' kittenish. Mama, listen, I'm gonna sing this like I will if I go on the stage. You know, with this show. I'm gonna sing it jazzy. Now get this ...
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
Yeah?
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
Oh no--
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
What?
I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
Yes.
Did you like that, Mama?
We only got one .. He doesn't drive.
Only me and Mom ..
No, my mother's .. You better stop in .. I'm just here to feed the cat.
The van?
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
Kid told me he didn't take it?
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you.
Did he get you the job?
Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
Your predecessor. He did- n't like to get outta bed. Catch you later, Freddy T ..
Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?
What does that mean, Sergeant?
Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
I've heard you call him Freddy.
He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..
Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
<u>If</u>, your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for <u>one</u> out of <u>two fucken seconds</u>, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
Bullshit.
Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what?
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
His blind friend got "attacked." Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper.
Wrong cabinet.
What are you looking for?
Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John ..
I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her ..
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, Sergeant. What I said on the phone's the same as I'm saying now. I got no idea where Amb- er is, or who it was took her there.
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
The man from the F.B.I.
Yes, Sir.
I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
You find something curious in that?
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
How you doing on those shoes?
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still ..
Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
Two or three years ago.
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
You want something, darling?
Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne?
He's happy, darlin ..
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
So tonight she confesses?
Freddy's new obsession ..
Bobby's out .. What's the hurry?
I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.
No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
He tells her, "bye-bye," and she gets "attacked." Well, give me a fucking break! There <u>is</u> no "Ser- ial Killer." Stick her name up in neon, there's still no Serial kil- ler! And I ain't the only one say- ing it. Everyone in this building is saying it. And I mean <u>everyone</u>.
You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant ..
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
I think I've found a hand.
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
No, Sir.
I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
A derelict.
He was waiting for you, Sir. Wait- ed a good while. Said he'd go down and take a look. I hope that's O.K.
On the infill. The guy from L.A.'s just gone down there ..
You can drive down there, Sir ..
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
Talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art I have not mastered.
Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.
"Something in the way.  Yeah."
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
I see what you're saying.
Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
Ten seconds, Rod.
It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella.
I'm sorry, I --
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.
Not right now, Jerry.
What happened to Denver?
You know I don't do "contracts." But'cha do have my word, and it's stronger than oak.
Denver is where he should be.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
We decided to stay with you.
Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
How sad --
Oh no -- _ 14.
To the pools?
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
Gorgeous.
Oh, tell the story.
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
It's the death rattle of my singlehood, right? Because I finally see the white picket fence looming and I love it/hate it/love it/hate it/ love it... you're right, I'll know when I see him. Why is it so easy to talk with you?!  Tell me about your fiancee.
And I can't say his name without laughing I want to eat him up. I want to say goodbye to every bad thought I ever had about relationships.  I mean, I crave this guy... and yet... why... why did I have that affair this weekend?  Does that mean I'm not in love with my boyfriend?
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
What --
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
My husband believes in you.  We're gonna make it.  Bye bye Dorothy.
I'm sorry what I said back there.
What DO you stand for???
What are you talking about -- "don't get emotional." If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional ENOUGH about this man. _ 98.
And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
You gonna get that --
I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
I'm not putting him down, I just have a commitment to the truth.
Shut up!!!
He should have kept his head tucked down.
What'd I say?
Can you be quiet?
He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself.
That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
Goodbye, Alan.
Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
Good luck with the fund raising.
You think they could talk to each other?
I try not to.
My favorite.
Anything good?
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
No.  I feel something.
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
It matches the pictures.
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
How do you mean?
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
How did you know?
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
It doesn't matter what I think.
Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
Minimal.
Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --
You'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials.  I believe you already know Sarah Harding.  She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers I bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this.  If you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup.  When she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously.
I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it, but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
Everyone, keep your voices down!
But he's the head of InGen!
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-
-- my --
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
I want to see the nesting ground!
Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.
I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
Phones are out too.
The monitors are failing.
Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
The door security systems are shutting down.
It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a lot worse.
Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
It's not worth taking the chance, John.
That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
'Bout thirty seconds.
No trick to it.  Just stop running the program.  Leaving them unattended.
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
Uh - - about two million.
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
What?  No menthol?
How am I supposed to transport them?
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
Oh, I'll get 'em all.
Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
You shouldn't use my name.
Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
Shhhhh!
Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
You won't be able to miss them.  Can't miss them.
Pretty sure.
Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
They are?  I'll be damned.
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
It's all right.
Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.
No. We can't.
C'mon on, this way.
The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
Stick to my heels.
Come on, let's go.
I'm going with you.
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
They're not here.
I don't know.
Dr. Grant!
Ellie, com one!!
Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks.  People just disappear.  No blood, no trace.  	That's the way it happens.
That's right.  But they never attack the same place twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically.  They remembered.
They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
Why not?
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
I understand that.  I'm sorry to hear that. We'd be well advised to deal with this situation now.  The insurance company - -
He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
He sends his apologies.
What's this I hear at the airport Hammond's not even here?
Hola, bienvenido
Hola, Juanito
Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
Are they heavy?
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
What are we looking for?
Hey!  Where are the brakes?
Thank you.
I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice?
Sure, they will, they will.  We'll have a - - coupon day or something.
And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -
John, we - - what I'm just saying....
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
Thanks, Dad.
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
Sure.
There's no sign of him anywhere.
Thanks, Steve.
Sustain winds 45 knots.
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
No, no... listen, when I get back to New York we'll meet with the Board.
You want to put in chain saws?
Chain saws.
Hey, smart-ass, I'm up here right now in a... luxury alpine retreat, with a two million dollar view of the lake.
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
Ken, we've been through this...
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
Fifty.
Really? How much?
Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
Hello?
I want to look at the rest of the house.
I really think we should go back...
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
Help me with this.
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like.
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
I know... but we left the main trail... and I can't find any landmarks around here... I've been trying to figure it out but...
You have a map.
I think we're lost.
Yeah?
Mister Biller?
Great.
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
Get rid of them.
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
Jesus Christ!
I don't think you're getting in the spirit of things, Janet. We'll buy whatever studies we need --
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
That's not true...
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
No, but...
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...
Who's there?
He... he's here...
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
Other guy?
What about that other guy?
I don't know...
Where's Ken? Is he all right?
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
Who is this? What's going on?
Hello?
Come on.
Who?
_Krueger_...
What happened?
His camera... it's still recording.
What?
It's still on.
Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.
What's going on?
Fuck you.
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
What?
And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
Quite a circus.
That's my job.
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
Two.
Did you find a scalpel? Did you find a murder weapon?
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
Jason's. It came out of his chest... a hand with long blades on the fingers...
Who's chest?
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.
Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
A house?
Compared to this guy... amateur.
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.
What are the charges?
Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.
Three.  Where's my client?
A seminal film. First ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
"Zombie Sluts From Beyond the Grave."
This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns, Comedies, Film Noire, Science Fiction...
You watch this garbage?
I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore, we have to try everything.
You think that's going to work?
Wrong. Jason can't get a fair trial because of _these_.
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
Video store?
Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.
It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
Sorry.
I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.
Are you going to plead insanity?
My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
What happened? Where's Jason?
For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...
Are you all right?
Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
We're down to seven minutes.
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
Ten minutes...
About ten minutes.
How long will the effect last?
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
What's that?
Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
And if he's not?
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
Think it'll do any good?
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
You know how to use one of those?
Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone.	But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
Where's he going?
Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
Jason's asleep... maybe he's dreaming of himself as a young boy... and that boy is sitting right here.  I think he's some kind of projection from Jason's subconscious.
How's that possible?
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.
What are you doing?
A cameraman caught him on videotape. Joe, I saw an entire sheriff's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn't there...
You saw him?
It was Krueger, wasn't it?
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
You're not going to be there?
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
Great.	When can you do it?
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
Not yet.
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
So what do we do?
Add it to the list.
That doesn't make sense.
It's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming.
_It's a second REM pattern_.
Yeah, what is it?
See this?
Yeah... I think I understand...  You're drunk, too.
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
Uh-huh...
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
Fascinating.
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
Well, I'm onto something more useful.  You ever hear of a man named Fred Krueger?
Me too. I'm drunk.
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
I'll take my chances. Come on, I'm buying.
That's open to debate.
Cute waitresses?
There's a pizza place over on Market.
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
We're going to need at least two full REM cycles to get a clear neurological profile. Three hours minimum, six hours ideal.
How long will he need to be asleep?
Then I'd say it's bedtime for Jason.
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
How do we prove it?
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
It's a neurological disorder affecting the hypothalamus. The part of the brain that causes sleepiness is inactive. They didn't know about it back in the sixties. Even now, it's not understood very well.
Insomnolesence...
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
Oh?
No. You've told me all I need to know.
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
That didn't sound very convincing.
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.
My job is not to determine his guilt or innocence. That's up to the jury. My job is defend him.
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
None of that's true?
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
I thought she was a killer, too. You know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.
So?
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
Well, I definitely feel sorry for you.  August fourteenth, 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium...
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
This is Jason Voorhees. They'll be looking for an excuse to send him to the chair.  If we're going to argue insanity, we're going to need something a little more concrete.
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.
Oh?
I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
He wets the bed?
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
Doesnit sleep?
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
He's fucking nuts.
Well?
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
What is it really?
Where do you live?
You work in the insurance department?
-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
Fine -- terrible.
No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
Yes -- we do.
Yes -- that's us.
Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.
Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake.
-- Small.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
-- Merely in the interests of order.
You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.
Who's to say he ever will?  He's a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyone's toes -- In fact, I'm the only one he trusts and he wouldn't even look at a document if it didn't first come through me.
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
Did you see him?
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
And you're late!
It's what I'm paid to do.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
Still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings.
-- Just doing our job.
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are.
We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
The loyal civil servant.  I suppose you'll deny that shortchanging the workers to whom compensation is due is standard company policy.
-- Gabriela, on the other hand, had made an enemy of this man Burgel.
Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty.
When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
That's obvious, isn't it?  We have an opening for a new member.
As a matter of fact you've caught us in a state of considerable excitement.  Our latest preparation we believe -- we pray -- is perfected. It should take years off her.
-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.
On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one.
May I ask where your two warders are?
Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
-- You seem amused.
You see, Kafka, in all cases relating to the factory at Orlac -- which is what this paper referred to -- the authority that puts in a request and the authority that grants it is, to all intents and purposes, the same authority.
Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
Amerika!
Amerika for us!
Then that's the place for us!
What's to become of us now?
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!
This is filed incorrectly!
Ludwig?
Oskar!
My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
And we're upset too.
It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.
It's not too bad working here.
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
Women are all you have on your mind!
Gabriela Rossman was here looking for you.  Do you know her?
You look tired.
He can't sit still.  Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.
Oskar.
Ludwig.
Now Ann ...
Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast!
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - "The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!
Miss Darrow ... I've been thinking. I would very much like to dedicate this motion picture to the memory of your father. It's a great shame he wasn't able to join us on this adventure. Truly a wonderful man.
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
Kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, Miss Darrow. All we're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to reduce my handicap.
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
Hi - Carl Denham. I'm A big admirer of your work, sir. I've loved all your discoveries. I really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. It'll be good for you and good for me.
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -
These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!
Photography teaches you nothing, Ann! Click! One second and you've seen all you're going to see. I want you sitting here with your paper and pencils ... I want to see every chisel mark reproduced with painstaking accuracy. Understand the carving and you will understand the people! That Ann, is the key to archaeology.
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
I think you're trying to run before you can walk, Ann.
What have you got there?
Oh my God ... Ann?
They' re dead.
Just take it easy .-- Where are the others?
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
Two... maybe three.
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
There's no island there. We're wasting our time!
We need those co-ordinates -someone's gotta get back there and jot the rest of it down
I tell you it doesn't exist!
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
Man Eater!!!
That's too bad.
We are a very modest and deeply religious people, Mr Denham.
Y'know ... traditional ceremonies where the woman ... divest themselves of their undergarments.
Native costume?
Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
The mountains?
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
And I appreciate that so much, I really do - a sentiment that will be shared by audiences across America when they view my latest documentary sensation "Indonesia ...Hell Hole of the World". Ernie Hemmingway's agreed to write the narration. We're going out through Universal ... Laemmale's promised me fifteen hundred screens.
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
It must have been terrifying?
Did you fear for your life?
Are you nervous Jack?
She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
How about Ann? Is she going with you?
I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
The girl's dead, Driscoll. There's no point continuing on.
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
Yeah? ... Well, I gave 'em a taste of American lead ... and I don't see 'em coming back for seconds!
Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!
Kong ...
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
What was it, Jack?
Did you see her?
What's compassion, mister.
What's that?
Why?
Are you gonna start it up?
What about him? Yes.
Please, if he sees you, he won't come!
Can't you see I'm strung out?  Please, we're waiting for it -- he's got to have it!
Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.
Well she's not now.  I did everything for Arlyn. I loved Arlyn I took her right into my apartment, my own sweet apartment on First. But she wouldn't stay off it -- the junk -- and I wept and I pleaded and I held her in my arms - and she started taking things, my things, and selling them for horse. My clothes. We could've had everything together, everything -- and then the bitch sold my mink!
Why? She's a junkie.
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
Yes?
Please --
Mm.
Yes?
Sure dear, yes.
Enjoy.  Well --
Didn't want you.
You think people hate you.
Sorry.
Don't belong?
You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it.
Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
I'd just be guessing.
Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.
Yes indeed.
Well I have to close up now.
-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --
Like for you to look for the man.
Here please.
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
No, that's not --
I guess he figured it was better.
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
Well we're pretty --
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
No, not Grunemann. He's dead. The man that killed him -- also prob'ly Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page.
A few more days. We know who did this.
Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
Have you discussed this with them?
I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
What's in it?
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
John, how are you?
Would I be telling you all this? She copped out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
Two years ago? Sorry.
I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?
I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear.
Oh sure they try. The idea of a better life.  But they don't really know much about life: They get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. Just the trick, the transaction.
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
Not unusual.
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?
But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
Examine this letter please.  We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question.
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
Then how are you involved?
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter.
It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.
Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
What else do you know?
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
Thought it might. It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody.
Think this is our guy?
Well?
That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.
He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
Yes sir, we know he --
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
Klute offered us his services; we've accepted.
Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent --
Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.
The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands.
Trask --
Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
Are you closing the case?
Very well, I'd like to see him if I may.
What does?
Does that distress you?
Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?
Good.  I'll see him in there.
Where is the child?
I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.
Mr. Kramer?
In real life when does he hit you?
Tell me, does your daddy ever hit you?
What do you like best about your daddy?
What do you like best about her?
Do you like to be with your mommy?
What about your mommy?
I see you have people there. What are their names?
What do you have here, Billy?
On earth.
Show.
Greatest.
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Then I have concluded my questions.
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
I do not, your honor, however--
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
Yes, your honor.
Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
Sustained.
Overruled.
Objection!
Sustained.
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
Overruled.  The witness will answer, please.
Objection!
Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?
Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
And yet you chose to leave him?
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
And what is your present salary?
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Did you wish to?
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
And would you describe those years as happy?
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred.
Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
So do I.
No questions.
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague.
Objection!
Objection!
Objection!
Objection.
Thank you.  I have no further questions.
And yet you fired him.
And how did you find his work?
And did you have a close personal relationship?
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
My, we are a hot shot aren't we?
Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
I understand and I'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up....  ...after the first of the year.
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
You've got that look.  My lady and I split two years ago in August and I'm an old pro at this shit.  First thing, stay away from the Children's Zoo.  It's pure hell--if I never see another chicken, I'll be happy.  I'm here, darling.  Don't worry...
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Mr. O'Connor called.  There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.
Then you don't have a choice. Have Billy at the Seventy- Fifth Street entrance to Central Park, Saturday at ten.
You ever see her talk to the walls?
She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.
How the hell are you going to do that?
Any prospects?
Ted?  Are you there?
Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
Mr. Kramer, there's--
Now, I'd advise you to wait outside.  It'll be eas--
Ten.
But I'm going to have to take some stitches.
Your boy is very lucky, Mr. Kramer.  One inch over and it would have caught the eye.
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
Ted, what are you talking about?!
Huh.. .Hello?
Do not worry, Holiness. They fight for you. They are under your protection.
Khambas are wild men.
Kham, Holiness.
Yes, Holiness.
Please, come, Holiness.
We must go, Holiness.
I know.
And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."
No cried?
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
Cow.
Your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died.
Tell me.
Again?
Mama, my story.
Goodbye, Kundun.
Hmmm.
I will buy them for you.
Where will you keep them?
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
I do, now.
Are you? Of whom?
No.
Not the way to talk to people.
I am sorry, Lhamo.
And we will begin with tearing it down.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
I will not approve it.
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet.
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist. You will have to re-evaluate your needs.
The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
Are you, General?
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
Good. Our first request is that you allow us to build a road. You have no roads in Tibet. We can discuss the plans in Lhasa. When you return.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
I have a copy for you.
Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
Dalai Lama.
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
Holiness?
Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
Yes.
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
I am afraid.
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
We did not.
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.
It is calm.
He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.
We do not know.
Who am I?
Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
This many?
Two.
How many?
I will be back in a few days.
I miss him too.
I miss my brother.
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
I pooped.
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
Me. First break of day.
Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come."
Cow.
He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
Your father had been very sick.
Far, far away.
Oh, no. Where will he go?
Answer.
I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
I accept it. What is suffering?
Not until you are eighteen.
You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
What do you think?
You could buy them.
Thank you.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
Please, come in, so cold.
Good day.
Good day.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.
Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
It is too early to implement all the clauses of the Seventeen Point Agreement. We will establish a Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet. The pace of reform must meet with the desires of the Tibetan people. Changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary.
You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
You decide.
I have one more piece of news. A baby is coming.
Me?
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
What does the butter spot feel like?
True.
Is that a true story, or pretend?
Does he have the spot?
It may not be your decision to make.
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
These are not human beings. They are worse than ghosts.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
I do.
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
Eliminate you.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
It is a difficult situation.
What would you do, Holiness?
Completely.
It is possible, Holiness.
I see that.
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
Too young?
The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
You're all fuckers.  Vicious little fuckers.
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
No.  Do you?
Oh, yes.
Oh yes.  I killed him.
I'll sue you.
Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat.
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
The <u>reason</u> I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing.
I haven't broken any laws.
Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead.
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
Go!!!
Jesus.  About twelve more yards.  Keep coming just like that.
I might get a shot.
<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
<u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>Hector</u>.
Why are we landing?
It seems like we're getting lower.
Thank you.
Shitbutt?
Liar?
Backstabber?
Kelly--
It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
Kevin told me you were upset.
Wild guess.
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Agent Starling! Telephone!
Hot damn, Clarice.
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
Well, except for the one girl.
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
Lecter said a lot of things.
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
Why not?
Why does she keep repeating the name?
You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
I love it when you talk dirty.
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
Listen, I hope you never need a thing I've taught you. But you've got something... Jack sees it, I do too. If you ever need to, you can shoot.
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' you about it now, 'cause he may never.
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
I don't know! Get me out!!
Get me out!
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
He's my patient! I have rights!  I'm not just some turnkey, Miss Starling. I shouldn't even be here this afternoon. I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice.
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions... On the afternoon of July 8, 1981, he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary. His mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an EKG. When the nurse bent over him, he did this to her...
Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils. No staples or paperclips in his paper. Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you. Do you understand me?
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.
I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy.
The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis, and three civilians. I've got -
Starling -
Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.
Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun, too. Be on the next plane, Starling, there's one in 90 minutes.
Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.
You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case. Back to Quantico.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Oh.
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
Okay, Miss Starling?
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But, if you say this is an FBI matter...
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...
Jack Gordon.
Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
Freddie was so happy for me when I got this job. This - toaster giveaways, and Barry Manilow on the speakers all day - she thought this was really hot shit. What did she know, big dummy...
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
She died. She went to Florida to retire, like two years ago? She dies own there.
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
They said she was just rags, like somebody -
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?
That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.
Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.
I'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
Let's go with it.
Yes... I did.
What...?
You have my word. Paul?
The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...
Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.
I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin.
Officer Starling. Welcome back.
Of course it counts. How do you play?
No fair! You lured him with produce.
Time, Pilch! My move.
Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
Can we rest soon?
I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
We leave in the morning?!
You do not know what you are saying!
But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
I sent three men to Webb!
What?
My letter...
Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
Will you men help us stop the French?
Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
What did you say?
It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
You're not coming with us?
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
We'll see in the morning...
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
You forget yourself!
I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
What did you see, Major?
That's all, sir.
Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
What else?
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
Yes. You may.  You there. What does Munro call you?  The "Scotsman" has sent one of his Indian allies to guide you.
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
And what is that?
The decision is final.
Death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same. Today I have learned that they are not.
I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis.
Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow.  Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message.
Webb's at Edward?
Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them. They keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a two hundred yard range, so when they're close enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust. They look to be three hundred yards out.  Bloody murderers.  You have three days.
What a place for them...
Thank you. How can I reward you?
What happened to you?
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
Right - about face! March! First rank present!
Yes sir!
Atten-hut!
Sir!
Shoulder arms!  Present!
Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
First rank! Second rank! Present arms!
Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready!
Heart. Give Magua new heart.
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
For Munro children?
Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
Wampum?
Gifts?
Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
Does the rule of English law no longer govern?  Has it been replaced by absolutism?
This interview's over! The militia stays!
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you.
Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
My son Magua's pain is my pain.
Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
And this?
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
Yes.
Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.
Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
Granted, Monsieur.
I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
Allow me to consult with my officers.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
My colors?
Granted.
The honors of war?
They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
Their arms?
My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
Such as...?
Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
La victoire.
Le mot d'ordre?
France.
Qui vive?
Be careful with it.
Intelligence may not be the right word...
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
For this...you don't need to be.
Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.
He did.
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
You mind if I take a look at this?
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
Huh?  I...uh...uh...
Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
Shit...
Oh, God, she's out there...
It bit me!
Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---
No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
Excuse me, sir...
...I'd really have to show it to you.
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
What about our quota?
Where's Doc?!
Roger.
Twenty minutes...
I'm going inside.
Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
And it killed Bo?
Okay, number 23's full.
Okay.
Ahhhh!
I realize you must have gone through hell--
Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
Unfortunately.  We can't.
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
Beautiful.
Well, suit yourself, then...its your decision...  Ha ha...a little joke...suit yourself...
...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
Personal effects...
You're damn right I do.  Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside.  I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that.
You got money in this tub?
Not yet.
Hook's on 24...
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
What about his suit?  That's a million five the company's got to replace.  They'll make somebody go get it.
Who else...Sixpack.
If he had his blinkers on--
The weather's good, I already checked, but I'll be off in a minute.
I'm telling you, it's the suits!
Take it off and let me have a look.
Itches like hell.
Still bothering you?
What was it?
It...almost got you.
What happened?
...and a Russian grandmother...
Bullshit.
Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...
You read Russian?
Russian.
What the?...
I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
What's going on?
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
What music?  There ain't no music.
Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here...
No way, Mister Beck!  <u>No</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation!
I'm going to kill it!
It's Sixpack!
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
He's tanking on us...
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
I do, man.  That's a beautiful place.  When I get out of here I'm going there.  Find a nice little snow covered chalet, warm little woman, crackling fire--
Who cares?
Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!
Look.  Water.
Getting some food.
What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
Typhoon?!
Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
I don't know.  I'm guessing.
...It has many traits of deep sea marine life...regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy...  but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality...
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
It's had a meal.
I'm going to try to remove it.
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
The infirmary?...
Two hundred meters.
Don't worry, darlin, I'm...
What's wrong, did you miss me?
Bitch!  Look what you did!
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
Well, talk.
A traffic warden. Look, what's this?
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
How much did you part with?
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
Jesus, Tom, do they work?
Yeah, but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar.
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
Apart from those shotguns.
Well?
Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.
Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.
You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
It's a Samoan pub.
I thought this was a pub.
You want a pint, go to the pub.
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
What's that?
You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Back-you-up with-a- Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?
Yeah, Bazza, what?
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
You fucking well have to get 'em!
I am not fucking interested.
They were . . .
Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
Not in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammer-lock muskets the butler was carrying; they were ours, and we sold 'em!
There were two old guns there; where are they?
I don't know what you mean.
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
There are no others.
Where're the others?
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.
You should see what they did to poor Gary.
You get the guns?
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
Like antiques.
Like what?
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
Good, you can get this under control now.
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
Where did he get a hundred grand?
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
Fucking Northern monkeys.
I hate these Southern shites.
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
Yes?
I think I can help you, as it happens.
Can I help?
Nope.
Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
JD.
Good job, Chris.
It looks like t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
They were going to pay, then?
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
Have you counted the money?
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
No Harry, you can't.
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
Hello, John. Nice holiday?
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
Son, have a look in his locker.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
Jesus Christ!
Mind your language in front of my boy.
You had better be careful.
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
What are you doing?
All right, furry muff.
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
You all right back there, mate?
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
Son?
Well, put your seatbelt on then.
All right, Dad.
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
Try that one.
It's not him, Dad.
Let's have a look, shall we?
Just carrying a bag.
Is he on his own?
About twenty minutes.
How long has he been in there, son?
I am sure you do, but I don't think you understand; I am not going to see them or the guns again.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
What can I do for you?
Sure is.
Is that you, Dean?
That's no way to answer the phone.
Yeah?
Furry muff, let's go.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
We gotta get those guns.
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
Jesus, I have heard about him.
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
Who was that?
It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?
All right, Kenny.
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
But...  Give it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em.
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
The stupid bastards! Count it!
Dog, I have found the cash!
In fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem, isn't it? You could say that in the scale of these things this is the Mount fucking Everest of problems, couldn't you? . . . And the reason it is such a mon fucking-strosity of a problem is because you don't have the first fucking idea who did this to us, do you?
Er well, yes we do.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you responsible.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
How about you? All right?
My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?
OK, open the gate.
Yeah, one of them's out.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
Just give me the keys.
It must be this one.
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
Just hold on, I got the keys.

And it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the rest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, scare and gag 'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When the job is done we'll come straight back here. It's dark by then, unload and Robert's your father's brother. Everybody savvy?
No.
What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.
Even if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle; they're gutless faggots.
Is there no way they can get back to you?
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.
Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.
What they like then?
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
So do you know these geezers well?
Out the back.
And the weed?
Out the back.
Where?
Plank?
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
There is only three of us here.
And all your friends, there's a good lad.
All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
Right, his leg's going now.
Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.
J, what's going on out there?  Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.
What the fuck is going on?
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I do mean no one.
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
Invitations.
I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!
It's pay day, ain't it?
That you, boy?
And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold.  OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?
For half a million?
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
I will loan you the money.
I will.
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that.
You must be Eddy. JD's son.
You got it all?
And you do have a reputation, so I'll choose my words carefully. But not to put too fine a point on it, fuck yourself, Harry!
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
Do you want me to draw a picture?
And?
I want your bar.
Yes?
I like your bar.
Go on.
What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.
What are you doing, Plank?
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
Lives and learns doesn't one.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
Hold on. OK.  Look Willie, it's Plank outside asking for you, he says it's in our interest.
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
I can't help you, Plank.
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
Well, perhaps you can help?
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
Hello, can I help you?
Rory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy boy.
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
Seven hundred each.
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
Doesn't sound very good to me.
And that does include the amp?
How much did you say it was, Tom?
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
So I've just got to put you in, and I am off.
So?
My van is half full.
At what, exactly?
Look. Go on, look.
You've already been fifteen.
I'll only be a minute.
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.
What do you mean?
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
We need fertilizer, Winston.
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
Er, fertilizer.
What are you carrying, Willy?
The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked.
Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem?
It's pathetic. You can't be desperately in love when you're 14 years old.
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
You jerk--
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
Private Johnson!
We're not running a dating service here.
And you and Private Graves--
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
Now or later, Charley. You won't have any trouble finding me.
You little pissant--
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
You're fired. You're outta the department.
Whole different story; isn't it?
Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
I'm not picking it up.
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
That's not the point.
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
I roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera."
So?
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
What's that for?
He never asked her.
Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither.
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
Come on in.
Come on in--
Hey, it's the General.
So that's him--
My government can go fuck itself, and so can yours. I'm talking about people here--men. Mi amigo Eladio Cruz is giving some friends of his a lift in his camion one day--
Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?
Something like that.
Fifteen years in El Paso.
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
You know who it was they dug up?
Man's gonna retire in two years and he offer to quit. Big goddamn deal.
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
We been through this before--
Seriously.
So where does that put us?
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
You spoil 'em, Cliff.
He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
Old Sam stood for somethin', you know? The day that man died they broke the goddamn mold.
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
--warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored
Take that pair over in the corner--
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that.
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
Protection?
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
Bandidos, Injuns--
Reputation?
You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
Eladio Cruz.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
What's in the back?
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
Me llama Eladio Cruz--Bienvenido a Tejas. [Welcome to Texas.]
Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
Como se llama? [What's your name?]
No te molestas. Tenemos a ella. [Don't worry. We've got her.]
Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away by the current--]
Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
Aqui! [Here!]
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
Your mother was a saint.
Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him.
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
'57, 1 believe--
Tell that one, Hollis--
They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish--
Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
He was a unique individual.
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
When we backed you--
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
That's a matter of interpretation--
Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce boys got to keep things hummin'--
Historic occasion, isn't it?
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
There was a mandate in the last election--
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.
Sam--
We're building up tourism, Sam--
You told me one time it was true love.
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
How 'bout the Sheriff?
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
Your mother's family is Spanish?
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
Steve called for you.
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
No. Is he sick?
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
How come?
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
Can I get this?
You got in late last night.
She finally got in--
What's she singing about?
You gonna stay out here?
Mom?
What?
Not if you have half a brain in your head.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
I didn't want to be going around your back.
How 'bout you?
Yeah.
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
Oh.
They got telephones.
The Republicans?
Uh-huh.
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
You're out early.
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
You suckers haven't had a good day since the Alamo.
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
Just doing my job.
You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--
You been talking so much trash today, you made us think you're a dangerous criminal. Be a good boy, now--
You don't need to cuff me.
Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.
And people better clear out of here! Now!
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
No, Sheriff, I'm just--
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up--
Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--
The stories people tell, he was a real colorful fella--
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
The other one? Hell, at my age, every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one. Your head's all crowded up--here it is--
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
Me neither.
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.
But you don't see much competition, do you?
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
Houston, huh? I hear they let you boys run wild up there.
Been away. Up to Houston.
How come you don't took familiar?
Runnin' numbers without I know about it is both illegal and unhealthy. You remember that.
Runnin' numbers illegal.
As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?
Why you think that was?
I know that.
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
Uh-huh.
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
Payne.
Otis what?
Name's Otis.
I know you?
You believe that?
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?
He's gonna find out.
He doesn't need to know all my business.
You going to tell him?
You going to tell her?
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
Thirty-five bucks.
You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
Mister D'Amour?
That's so cool.
Isn't that French for something?
D'Amour.
How'd you spell that again?
Who did this?
Who did this?
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
Why would I do that?
It's an illusion.
What about death?
Death.
About?
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
What do you mean, "all of us?"
We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
He won't.
I don't want him getting in the way.
No.  He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit.  Like you.
He's a priest?
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
I know him.  I saw him.
D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
It's him... it's him.
If you've lied to me to me --
Anything?
You'll do more.than that.
So tell me where Nix is buried.
I could scoop them out.
Maybe he'll show you.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
It was me.
He's with us... He's with us...
He's with us...
Be ready.
Yes...
Will you come to him on your knees?
Yes...
Do you wish him to be amongst us?
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
Yes.
And are you afraid?
Yes.
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.  They knew the Puritan was coming home.
Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
Another fucking magician. Jesus.
And this Butterfield guy--
After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones.
Where the fuck is he?
New one on me.  Okay.  Let's see him.
What makes you so sure?
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
What were you doing up there?
Fuck you.
Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
He was a freak.  Everything he did was tainted.
I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
Oh, I've got plenty.
If he was so good why's he so dead?
They weren't worth a damn.
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
Trickery and divinity.
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
She has no real grip on reality.
Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
Yes...
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
You can't change it.  You have to walk...  ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept it.
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
My God.
Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.  He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
For an introduction.
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
You know Vinovich?
You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
At birth.  I don't know you --
What?
Who is she?
One question.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
Call me tomorrow.
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
No.  He's coming back.  He's digging his way out!
Yes! Yes!
Nix! Nix!
He's not!  He's not!
I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
I knew Swann.  He's a fucking liar.
Maybe... I... don't...
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
Have we met before?
Liar!
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
The woman has a new love in her life.  Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
You could still help me do that.
I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
Swann?  What are you doing?
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
You don't think I've got it to give?
I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
You'll do it?
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
Bob, it's me.
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
Take them.
My stockings.
Mr. Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy.
Do you like massage?
Mr. Harris?
Can I enter?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Mr. Harris?
One moment.
Hello? Yes?
One moment, please.
Excuse me?
Thank you, Mr. Harris.
Do you want I send it to your room?
Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
...Well, I have the worst  headache, I have to go find some aspirin. But, call me, let's have a drink, I'm under Evelyn Waugh.
Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
No!  Hi! So great to meet you!
It's amazing  there!
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
Promoting that action movie I did...
John! What are you doing here?
Just me.
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
Seemed...on edge.
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
Quiet.  Real quiet...
And how would you describe him?
Yes.
I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
I can take care of myself.
You have to tell me who did it.
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
It's nothing.
George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
You should know I never felt Mr. Birdson needed anything but professional psychiatric care.  And then, minutes after they left, he suffered a stroke. He's comatose.  No brain wave activity at all.
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
I think I should join you.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
It's the patient's request, doctor.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
You have a sister in New Orleans.
I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.
Is he going to be okay?
But bad judgement.  And now you see how dangerous the consequences can be.
The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.
Maya, for the last time, I will not tolerate these obsessions.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
I don't mean to belittle you, but we've been through this before.  Satan is not what you think he is.  Satan is not some creature.
...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
Miette, come here and relax.
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
Yes.  We won, that's right.
Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again...
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again.
Just open the door, please.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Two negatives always make a positive.
You just call?
What's his name?
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
How many weeks are you honey/
Kelson, hold on a second...
I'm not waiting until it's too late.
You don't want to face it.
Sure of what?  Who cares if this guy is devoid of faith or sleeps over a pentacle?  Results are what Lareaux would want.
It's useless...look at him.
Alright, Maya.  We'll do it your way.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
A lot of good that'll do.
And what are you thinking we should do now?
Maya?  What do you mean?
Hello?
Whish the circumstances were different.
Goodbye.
You do know, don't you.  That these are also numbers.  Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666.  The sign of the Devil.
Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
Viznick will get off and Michael's got a crush on you.
But she worships you.  Your mother's dead but your father's alive.
You are the younger of two...
Nice suit.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
He can see you Thursday.
Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.
Good of you to stop by.
It's Detective Smythe.
You watch.  One day, I'll hit the jackpot, get the big house, car, clothes.  I'll have more money than God.
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
I plan to.  You want a tip?
Would you sign it for me?
And what about you?  What about Peter Kelson?  Where is your moral compass?
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
Are you saying he's legally sane?
What do you mean by that?
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
Thanks, sweetheart.
You sure?
Which one for tomorrow?
Camille, she'll be fine.
She's alright.
You think I'd go hoarse for a player with no potential?   When I ignore you, that's when you worry.  Go get dressed.
What?
You want the job or not?
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
This time get your feet set.
Shh.  It's okay.
Your sister told me hands off, but I can't help myself...
That was nice.
Then I'll get you some punch.
I mean, I'm having a good time with you...
That was two words.
Careful.
I'm an English major.  You like English?
No, I mean I can check it for you.
Can I take your coat?
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
You could make a career by telling me where.
Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.
Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
To do what you love.
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
Why not?
Four days.
Get used to it, babe.
What?
Yes, we appreciate that.
Monica.  You grew up together, right? Quincy's told me about you.
Hello.
Why are you up?  Get in bed.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
I'll take that as a compliment.
So how's the job going?
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
Hey, munchkin.
I know.  But chances are...
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.
You lost your head.
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
Well, can you give him this for me?
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
Your hair looks so cute like that.
Hey, girl.
HEY FUCK YOU DON WATCH IT NOW.
No need for braces, Donnie.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
Your teeth are straight.
What surery?
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
Call 911, Mary, do it right now.
no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
Call 911. Call 911 right now.
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
These adults are tough enough, I think you'll be surprised -- the Mexican's a bit of a question mark --
You ok?
You smell like trouble --
Hello, Phil.
Hello?
-- no,no,no what is this? who? What's this guy's name?
What's wrong?
Claudia.
Yes.
No, what's wrong?
Yes.
-- what kind?
Diet Coke.
-- can I get you?
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
Don't tell me to go away, Stanley. I am the Co-ordinator in this show and you will answer the questions that I ask, you understand?
What happend, what's going on?
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
Just hold it, you'll be fine.
Can you hold it?
Not enough, what do you want?
What?
C'mon guys, settle down --
I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
Sure, why?
It's upstairs.
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
Ready to go,go,go?
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
I don't know, Richard, they need to talk it over --
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
Bite it, Cynthia.  You could get free things from people that want you to endorse their products.
-- Richard.
What do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --
It's ok, boy.
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
That idea is over now. We're not gonna do that now.
It's ok --
Please, boy, put it down and it's ok.
Son, please, now....
Put the gun down, please, boy.
-- no.
Son, don't --
We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.
No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now --
Phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  I'm gonna put you on hold -- Doc you still there?
I'm about to get off the elevator --
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
What happend?
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
Doc, go get Frank and put him on the phone.
What happend?
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
He's doing the interview with the lady --
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
What's up?
Doc it's Janet.
GIMME YOUR FUCKIN' KEYS.
Give me your keys, Don.
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
Don't do this, Don.
And how much is braces?
Your teeth are fine.
You don't need braces.
Braces?
What is that?
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
Don't Donnie. Don't do it.
The job here is to make him as comfortable as possible -- right now -- our job is to just try and make it as painless as possible. Right?  You understand?
This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
Do you wanna sit down?
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
I can help you through this the best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that you're listening to me, ok?
Yep.
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
No.
I think you have the wrong number.
Hello?
Are you ok?
What happend to you?
Come and tell me it's over and I'll walk away, Jimmy.  I've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- I'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --
Well can you do me one favor and don't do that.
Will you say my name?
Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
All your other fluzzies?
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
Then what?
Did your wife find out?
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
Are you alright?
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
You want her right now?
I'm sorry.
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
It's alright.
Want me to wake her up?
Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --
No, I'm just a friend.  What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?
I'm Bob.
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
She's asleep.
Hello?
When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
Saucy-saucy.
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
Was it a call back?
Not as much as I used to.  Ever since we started, I haven't really gone in to school that much because I've been getting more and more auditions --
Do you still have to do homework?
You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
No they don't --
Movie Of The Week.  I went up for one this morning with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim --
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
Do you have an agent, Stanley?
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
You been on Prozac long?  Dexadrine?
Must have alot goin' on for all that stuff you got back there, eh?  You could have quite a party all that stuff....
Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
Hello.
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ok.
Bottled Water?
mmm.hmm.
Mmm.Hmmm.
What would you like?
Partridge?
Phone number.
Pink Dot.
Stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there I'm gonna beat your ass --
-- the fuck are you talking about?
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
The fuck is wrong with you?
What are they gonna do -- beat us?
That's pretty cool.
What do you do?
What the fuck is goin' on, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
What is that?
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
...what...?
I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
I hate it.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh?
..sorry...
Hi.
..sorry...
Hi.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.
D'Artagnan.
Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
Nothing... Nothing.
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
No, stay back!  Stay back!
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
That is good.
And you were not hurt?
I understand you saved my son's life today.
No, Louis!  No!
He is your brother!
Louis, please -- !
Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
I wish to discuss your brother.
We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
May I speak with you?  Alone?
Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.
It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
Do I look all right?
All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask.
If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.
How did you --
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
Whose rooms are those?
Porthos told me.
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.
What is that?
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
What is its antidote?
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
Just... water.
I am unhurt --
Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.
... The ball... Continue.
Continue.
What was the end page?
You've... memorized...?
Two-thirty-seven:  "... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."
... Two-thirty-seven.
What number, on the first page?
Eh?
What number did you tear out?
Thank you, Keeper.
Food, moron.
No, Keeper.
You dead yet?
Magnificent valor...
The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
Out directing the search for the traitors.
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
Athos, the former Musketeer, has just fought with several of your guard, at the Musketeers' Gate.
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
We'll burn in hell.  Both of us.
Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
Oh Louis, Louis...
Did you know... about Raoul?
Shall I leave?
Sire, I --
You would do that, your Majesty?
I... we are humble people...
It's lovely.  It's just...
Raoul... is in love...
... Nothing.
Sire!  I -- How did you --
Sire, I --
Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
You mind if I ride with you?
Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
If you guys want in, fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
Every step of the way.
Cooperate?
I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth.
That's the point.  He slipped up, and he's desperate now.  And that means he's all the more dangerous.
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
What can I do for you?
Yeah?
Captain Doyle?
Alright, stay on the phone.
What do you think?
You set to go -
We're by Ozone...
Where are you?
Yeah?
No I mean ours, motherfucker! If I go down everyone's going with me - you and your crew especially! You won't get protection, you won't get the trucks - nothing!
You mean shut your ass down!
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
So what?
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
The shit just hit the fan, brother. That bitch has a partner and he got away from me.
What do you need?
It's Marvosa -
Well why don't you sit this one and get some rest...you look like shit. CUT TO INT TUBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
Where do you come from, Marvosa?
Gotta come from somewhere...
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
What?
Well don't you think that's odd?
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
Yeah...
Did you start out area six?
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
What?
Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
What's this?
Fine -
I'll take the south end -
I'm sure you can handle it.  Now I want to do an alley-to alley sweep beginning at the north and south ends from Marine to 30th.  Foot beat units continue on the boardwalk.
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
Right behind you.
Let's roll -
Fine...
Find out for me.
I don't know, shit.  Maybe she was looking for love...
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
What did the six-toes have to say?
I didn't hit shit!
Did you hit him?
Don't worry -
Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
Great. Well that changes a lot...
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
What the hell is this Marvosa!!
Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
What the hell happened?
we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!
You can cut the shit, asshole--
Did you report it stolen?
Bullshit...
I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
Are you alright?
Yeah, it was opened -  with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.
Anyhow...	you wake up and she's gone. But--  --this is my favorite part--  she leaves you the keys to a brand new Beemer.
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
Alright, where is she?
Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
And what did he do to the girl?
I was just having a little fun -
Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
Did he harm the girl?
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
And he took a swing at you?
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
Well let's get his ass to the garage!  Some lead...
He said he was following up some lead.
And where the hell is Marvosa?
Could explain why Fleming was there.
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
Something I don't already know?
Well read this -
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
Did you read today's paper?
That's great Zydowski, you tech guys are really on the ball.  Harding - call the print lab at the FBI, run the prints through their library, see if it's less screwed-up than ours...
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
What?  Wait a minute -
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
Yeah?
You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
Zydowski.  It's about time.
LAPD data center reports a breach on the system.  An outside hacker has accessed files on Detectives Fleming and Stanton...and yours too, Marvosa.
Yeah?
Captain?
Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we're on our way -  You coming?
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
Speak of the devil.
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
Where is he?!!
I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
Who is it?
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
I'm not going anywhere!
Shit, we just started.  But I better log out of this.
Ahh, shit.  We're pretty much tapped out.  I'm getting denied access all over the place...
And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.
You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.
I'll access the LAPD mainframe, but we gotta be careful - that one's kind of tricky -
I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
Donut?
Let's see what we got...
OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
OK...where do you want to start?
Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
Alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times.  What do you want to do?
Oh man...what happened?
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
And?...
Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
Yeah, c'mon in...you scared the hell out of me!
Holy shit -
This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
Jesus, man...
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
What?
Not with this...
Screw him!
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
I'm stranded out here.
Mind if I come along for the ride?
You must be going somewhere.
Where are you going?
County jail - get in.
Then what did you do, play canasta?
Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
Did you have sex with her?
Nahhh...
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
Long gone, huh?
Long gone... MARVOSA Well you won't mind if I don't take your word for it, right?
Where is he?
Don't you guys ever knock?
I don't recommend it.
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
I wouldn't presume to try.
It was you who did the asking.
Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
What about him?
How are Molly and the boy?
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
Right.  What about sweating Lecktor?
Christ!
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
Library of Congress.
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
If there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your boy...  He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions.  We can make out: 'six-six-six'.  I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it.
When do they go to press?
At the end is the tail of what could be an 'r.
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...
How long do I have?
'You're very beautiful.
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.
This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
Not yet.
He went to the men's room.
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
No.
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
Yeah. It's right here.
Do you have it?
When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book... We got him out of there and dug around...
Yes?
Dr. Chilton.
Come in.
Three, four hours.
In a holding cell.
It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
Uh... sure...
When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him?
The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?
As long as it's on soft paper.  You may...  Find this curious.
Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
Okay.
Yeah...
She doesn't have a Rolodex.
She'll be in, in the morning...
Linda doesn't come in nights.
Linda King's desk.
Goodbye.
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
That's true.
Cut the general crap.
Most people are.
I don't think I'll tell you.
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
Why do you think I called?
Atlanta and Birmingham.
No. I can help you.
What's that?
My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
You going back down to Florida after?
Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
Lt. Fisk said...
Meet point's up ahead!
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
I can't thank you enough, I...
We're fine. Fine. We're all well. We're okay!  That man, Crawford, called and... told me...  ...how 'bout a drink? Coffee or something?
Oh, Jesus... Come in.  Honey...!
Yes. Who are you?
What do you want?
You got it.
I hope you have a second chance...
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
Good. You'll load these, Ever fire them?
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?
Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
B-but... we saw... your neck...
B-but... we saw... your neck...
No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!
You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
Andy!
Cue the commercial!
Okay, great!  So let's reset!
Ten.
Five.
Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair.  They might change the channel.
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
I don't wanna talk about it!
What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago.
Excuse me -- ?
GET OFF!
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
Then your father's a wimp.
You're a wimp.
Then your father's a wimp.
You're a wimp.
Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
It is apparently not working.
The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
Yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to TM.  But we feel that perhaps... you and the program have grown apart philosophically.
This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
Excuse me, Andy...
We are all impressed.
Goals are important.
Are you at peace with your family?
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Positive.
I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
I'll take my chances!!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
Oh.
I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
Get off my stage!  You're fired!
I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
We had a deal!!
Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.
"Burlesque"?
Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
"Speaking"!  Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking!
Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?
Why isn't he MOVING??
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
They're gonna lynch him!
Why is he saying these things?!
Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
What's in Memphis?
He said he's coming back!
Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
There!
Where?
I saw Michael!
Of course he's in his room.  All his "friends" are in there.
Is he in his room?
See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!
A -- a tourist.
SHUT UP!  I hate them Polish jokes!
It's my name.
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
Yes.
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
Bob Gorsky.
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
Bob.
What's your name?
Sure...
Know what?
You don't know.
We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
They are dead.  In either case --
It's already begun.
We'll need a search running.
Their next target.  The name is Neo.
Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
He'll be contacting us again.
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
Then the informant is real.
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
They won't make it.
The sewers.  Of course.
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
The orders were for your protection.
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
Oh shit.
Lieutenant?
Oh, God.
What?!
Should Tank I.D. it?
That's the third white van I've seen.
What?
Weird.
No way.  Not possible.
He's gonna make it.
All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
Something wrong, man?  You look a little whiter than usual.
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
Hallelujah!  You are my savior, man! My own personal Jesus Christ!
Two grand.
I know.  It's her fault.
It's Choi.
Let go of her.
Look fella...this is private...
Sounds good.
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
Thanks.
Follow me.
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Riverdale.
No, all we got is $40.
You got sparklers?
No.
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
Well, we want good stuff.
Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
Well the guy over there said...
Uh...can we give you a check?
Can't we come with you?
Why?
Yeah.
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
Waddaya think?
What can I say?
I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
Chinese food?
Hostess?
Stripper?
That's nice.
I know.
Fine.
Fine.
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
Wha?
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
What was it?
Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
Don't count it...it's all there.
What's the matter with this kid?
The girls like it loud.
You could say that.
Well...no.
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
I know...I know.
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah...just had it delivered...
Come on.
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
Red or white?
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications.  I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint.
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
Right away.
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste?
You mean this, sir?
Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
Yes, sir?
He'll wait --
We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
Hello, Quince.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
And what would that be?
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
Rass!
She knows you real self?
You loved back?
My Doctor Lady?
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
Make it time.
Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.
Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Make it go 'way.
Some spot you pick.
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
What you then?
Obeah.
Didn't you call a Board meeting?
The Board is waiting.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
Didn't the family get together last night --?
Nothing?
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
Yes, Bill.  The question.
Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
Watch it!
Time.
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
I want to have a look around before I take you.
Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest.  Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you.
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
Quiet.
I'm here.
I think you know --
There's going to be plenty of time for that.
It's enough now.
No, you're not.  You're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.
Are you giving me orders?
What you were talking about.
Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'.
I think you know --
I believe you did.
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
We're all ears.
We're all here, Bill --
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
I'm going to stick it out here.  We still have a shot.
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?

MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99
Whatever gets you off.
Should I wear it?
That's it?
Slam it?
Well, what then?
I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
Where'd you get it?
I like your car.
I haven't made a strong enough impression.
You did.
What?
Take the money and walk away!
Look, there's two hundred grand stashed in the car. Just take it!
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
Why?
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy?
Yeah, I remember you.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Thank you.
I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
I'm not appealing the decision.
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
I enjoy it.
It's good.
* Thank you.							    *
What was it for?							   *
Bullshit.							*
What cop?
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *
With the United Nations High Commission on Refugees.  Famine relief.
No.  I was in Namibia...
Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
Lemon or lime?
...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
They may have already, so we protect the living.  Proof she's alive?
Then that's it.  Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being.
So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
He any good?
I got to know.  There is never any room for "personal"...
And...?
About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.
Grieve elsewhere.
Turn around.
What's your twenty?
Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
What do you think?
Where's the new drop point...?
Yeah?
Okay.  What'd you spot...?
Good.
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
No, you don't, Jim.  'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.  So, right here, right now, they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.  What's it going to be?
Yes you do...
I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
Tell them what you want.
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
Deal.
Make it 35.
Make it 40%.
25% discount on the load.
My end?
Two main players plus three.
How many?
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
I got the item.
Okay.  You got the "item"?
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
So...?
'Cause she will tell you.
Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...
What'd Neptune tell you?
And what do I do with him?
I'll be there.
I do.  We don't do business with him...
Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.
I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know.  That part of what I do, you never want to find out about.  Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go.  Not me...
You afraid of violence?
Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
Sit.
Jos...
If you're down, we're down for the play.
If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
You're giving away your money, fool...
Eleven to seven he blows it.
If they ran the rental car or lease on this place...even if it's EPIC database in El Paso...they'd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep.  Then they'd find your deeper, hidden criminal selves...
You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
"Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."
I have faith.  In horoscopes and fortune cookies...
This I gotta see...  ...the "make up an excuse and stop" part.
How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them.  Sonny, I gotta go...!
Goodbye.
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
After I check on Francine and the boys, then I'm gone.  Sonny, tell Rico I'm so sorry.  I wanted you to know...
I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
They had me from the gate.
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
Where's Riccardo?
Sonny...?
...you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious, they make mistakes. You're worried about me.  Do not be.  I am careful.  I am cool.  I got Trudy, backup, whatever.  You worry about you.  Because you are the ones who are in denied territory, not me.  If your focus is on me, you'll miss something coming at you.  That's how people slip up. Get hurt.  And I'd die if anything happened.  You worry about <u>you</u>. You and Sonny...are in the dangerous place.  I'm fine...
...the lease, the phones, the cars...layers of false ident. Would take the FBI weeks.  How long did it take them?  Three hours? Four?  This means, "We can reach out and touch somebody."  Like Bad Teleflora.
Okay.
"Salutations from the south..."
You mean with the flowers...?
The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
...and thanks for the flowers.
Bored.
Yes.  What's up?
Yeah.
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him...
Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
What would you do...?
Why?
And...?
But what does your intuition tell you...?
Jos doesn't like the deal in South Florida...
Not French registry?
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
You work that out with La Senora.  You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship.  For collection in North Miami.  You warehouse it. Release it when we say.  I'm sure you have friends with fast boats...
<u>You</u> give <u>yours</u> to me.  <u>We</u> position all the assets hauling our loads...
Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
I had to lay eyes on you.
What do you care?
Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
Equipment?
Nicholas said you okay.  That's nice.  But how I know if you any good?
They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if...
What...?
I gotta, I gotta go...!
The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types...
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.
Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
It's up in Central Park, taking a leak. If you hurry, you'll make the supper show. Now get lost.
You're hoping to get a look at what?
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Must be some mess back there.
Yeah?
What you gonna do back there, East?
You ain't coming to work?
Why, that's perfectly dreadful. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all.
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
You gonna beat me, Joe?
Okay. Never argue with a man.
There's an E in MONEY. If that's your word.
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
That's pretty Freudian, Joe.
I know. Scribbage!
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
No. Of course not. Just something struck me funny...
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
He's got taxi fare.
What'll we do? Leave now or what? Your place or mine? Oh God, the second I looked at you I knew. Did you?
I can tell, can't you?
You're wasting your time. There's nothing in there.
I simply don't have it, Joe.
Here. Don't even thank me.
Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
What?
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing?
It's so exciting. New York. The mad forward thrust of everything. My sense of time here is completely altered.
A drink? I've got some nice gin. If you'd prefer something else, they'll send it up...
Right here, why not? I prayed in saloons, I prayed in the street, I prayed an the toilet. He don't care where, what He wants is that prayer.
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
Money from home, see, there's your strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son. I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm gonna run you ragged!
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
Ready for hard work, son?
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop, I say, poop! I've heard it all and I'm sick of it, sick to death.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
No. You got it.
You got it.
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
Instant V-goddam-D.
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...
He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is he all right?
Get lost.
Sold. Let's go.
Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
Ziat!
Nah, just covered with batshit!
Don't make me laugh.
What?
Want me to take over?
What?
You got that, shit face? Asina...
Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall.
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
Where?
History, man, history. How much?
Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
Hamidou.  Chief of the Guards. Don't fuck with him. He almost killed an Italian dude couple months ago.  Bad news. He try anything with you?
'Figgers.
Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
Olsun - "May it pass quickly." I'm Bell, Jimmy Bell. This is Erich something Swedish.
Getchmis olsun
Haps, railroad, bus timetables?
Billy?
Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean...  ...I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm... I'm not gonna make it.
The catacoombs?  Whaddya want, a door?  There's miles of em like a sewer system but they got to come up someplace in Istanbul.
--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.
Stop shitting me, man!
There's two ways out I figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. The other way is Under.
The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
Oh Jesus!
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
Why'd you do it, Billy?
Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
The Hilton.
Where'd you get that limp?
Don't worry about it.  Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
Right!  That's what we're shooting for.  Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here.
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
Ah, look!  they probably know where the campers are
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
How much?
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
Sixty Lira?
How far?
You know where they are?
Good.  Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
Would you recognize him again?
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
Lucky girl.
Girlfriend?
Be tough on 'em.
What's your father do?
Got a family back there?
Beats working.
How much did you figure to make?
How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
Something like that. Cigarette?
Just what?
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
Seven years...
You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.
Aslan, there...
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
A hundred grams.
Twelve years.
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
New people sometimes get on his nerves.
Feeling all right?
Just Erich.
How's it feel?
Billy!  Please!
We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
Hello, Billy.
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
What is it? . . . Billy?
No!
Billy, what's the matter?
You can't take anything seriously.
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
Work, work, work, that's all do
You 'Merican.  You don't know.
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
Cat, ah!  Ayip!
It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back.
I know exactly what you feel but you must not worry, we are acting immediately, we get the right court, the right judge,  I arrange everything - just right.  And I think we get you bail. If very bad, maybe twenty month sentence... But I think we get you bail...
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
Who got the Frenchman out?
The lawyer?
His name?
Lawyers?
Lady...
Jeremy...
Hey, you can't...
Take a look.
There's some weird shit here.
Peter...
Shit.
Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him.
Immigration's gonna love you for that.
Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
Right.
I think so. One right, two lefts...
H-how do I get...?
What?
There's really people living down here?
New York's finest.
Nino, please...
I pull.
Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
Hurry, the woman needs help!
He's special.
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
Gross. What is it?
That's it?
You the bug lady, right?
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
What?
Fuck! It broke the skin...
No shit.
What is it?
Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
She used a baster.
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
Just like Trump Tower, then.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.
No, the typing kind.
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
If I can.
Buster.
Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw.
Where is it?
I thought you were going to dinner.
Sean, please..
Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
Wasn't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago..The question is, do you trust her?
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
Not possible..
All done, chief..
Outrageous.  I won't let you take control of my company.
Where?
What are you talking about?
Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.
Ninety-three point four million.
More like two-two point two million.
Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
What are you talking about?
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.
Oh well, if that's how you feel about it.
Well do you disagree with that?
- or hard wired, right.  First line of perimeter defence'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house. Whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be picked up to a height of twenty feet. Basically impenetrable, I'd say.
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
What you got there, mate?
Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting.
Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy Baird's the name.  Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man.
That's it?  That's it? That's it?
There she is.  I got visual.
I hope there's a place to land.
We're due to take off.
Before we kill her or cure her..
Exactly where is she?
Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
Then we got'em!
What can we do' mate?
How're we doin', then?
How much longer before you can reach him?
Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'
He's heading down the stairs, now..
I'm fine..
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
Yes, he knew.  Just..
Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.
By asking me.
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
Do I?
You have Bellerophon.
You are infected with <i>Chimera,</i> my friend.
It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
A visit from an old friend.
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
To friends.
Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
Come on!
You're right, of course.
You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
They'll kill me.
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
Maybe we dont have to know what he looks like.  If hes got that list, hes going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
Nothing but civilians, Gene.
What kind of show.
But why tell us?
Whats Hunt doing on the TGV?
Only four more cars.
What about him...?
Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
That's S.O.P..
So what do you suggest?
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
May take a little time.
If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox?  I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA.
Is he serious?
Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
That's not it.  That's not the list.
You're not going to any meeting without me.
Merci.
We'll see.
Where exactly is it?
Bank?
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Give me a break, Pops.
I didn't touch it.
Just don't chew it.
Sorry, am I interrupting?
Just waiting for you, tubs.
Claire.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Ethan.  Hes out of pocket.
The package is in the open.
What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
Higher.
Forty-four.  Forty-five.
Very well.
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
You wish to meet Max?  This is the price of admission.
Would you remove your hat please?
And a lonely ass.
Such a nice ass.
I think I might just take that look.
Too wicked to have a drink later?
Jack you're so wicked.
That's what we do isn't it?
Jack...that's spying.
Why don't you take a look?
I don't know.
What's going on?
Loud and clear.
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
Of course I can hear you.
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
Its working.
I always check the batteries.
Its not working.
Connection denied.
Yes...  Its him.
Twenty minutes.
Thirty-two and change.
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
The Shawfish?
No, I'm going.
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
Very good.
Uh-huh
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
Are you ready?
I'm wearing your bracelet.
Why you looking around so much?
You haven't once said you like my dress.
Oh, Cosmo!
You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
And what did they say?
Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
Yes!
I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.
Hurry up.
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
You have too many dogs.
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
Good morning, Lucy.
It's wrong to just let them go.
I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
You should think about this.
That's a pretty big sin.
Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
What sins have you to confess?
Did you see the moon last night?
I will. But I must find the right moment.
Talk to him.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
Don't make yourself sick.
If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
Don't fight.
Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
I don't know.
He should pay.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
Don't fight.
My son does not like this Johnny Cammareri. He says he is a big baby.
I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
Lucy. There are big things going on in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, the only daughter of my son Cosmo, has engaged herself to be married a second time.
It's nothing!
Absolutely!
She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.
When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
I am alone in the world.
Sure!
Definitely!
But absolutely!
Yes?
Well. That explains it.
He's a plumber.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
It's a house.
My God, it's a mansion!
Yes.
You mean the whole house?
That's my house.
Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
I see.  Yes, of course.
Burn them.
There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
Burn her anyway.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
Am I right?
Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
Well, this is a temperate zone.
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
Where did you get the coconuts?
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
You're using coconuts!
What?  Ridden on a horse?
Get away!
Halt!  Who goes there?
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
Well, how did you become king, then?
Well, I didn't vote for you.
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
We don't have a lord.
No one live there.
Who are the Britons?
King of the WHO?
Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?
No, no ... not "is"!
You said it again!
I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
Oh, please!
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
Now - go!
And not too expensive.
One that looks nice.
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!
We want ... a shrubbery!
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
NI!   NI!
NI!
We are the keepers of the sacred words.  NI ... Peng ... and Neee ... Wom!
The same!
I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
Course it's a good idea.
Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
Make a bridge out of her.
... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.
And the hat.  But she is a witch.
... Well, we did do the nose.
I feel happy... I feel happy.
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
I think I'll go for a walk.
Do me a favour.
I feel fine.
You're not.   You'll be stone dead in a few minutes.
I'm getting better!
He will be soon. He's very ill.
I'm not dead!
Nothing... There's your ninepence.
Right.  Off you go.
Blue.
What is your favorite colour?
To find the Holy Grail.
What is your quest?
My name is Sir Launcelot.
What is your name?
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
Who approaches the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see.
I don't know that!
What is the capital of Assyria?
To seek the Grail!
What is your quest?
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
What is your name?
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
That's easy!
He hasn't got shit all over him.
Why?
I dunno, Must be a king.
Who's that then?
That's all right.  See you on Thursday.
Thanks very much.
Thursday.
When's your next round?
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
I can't.
I can't take him.
Don't be such a baby.
Yes he is.
'Ere.  He says he's not dead.
Ninepence.
Here's one!
Bring out your dead!
It just seems silly ... me lying here.
Farewell, Concorde!
Really, I feel fine, sir.
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.
I think I could pull through, sir.
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
I'm not quite dead, sir ...
At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...  Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!
And another!
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
Well taken, Concorde!
It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
Is it?
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
Gosh - Is he all right?
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
Well ... I'll tell you ...
I was saved at the last minute.
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
I'm ... your son ...
But, Father.
I know ... but ... I want the girl that I marry to  have ... a certain ... special ... something ...
But I don't like her.
Herbert.
I don't want land.
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
But, Mother ...
What - the curtains?
Oh, I see,  Right.
We're coming with you.
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
The Prince ... ?
What?
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
Just you ...
Until you, or anyone else ...
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
If we ... er ...
Er ... if ... we ... er ...
Leaving the room ... yes.
We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.
... and you'll come and get him.
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
You must see the doctors immediately.  You must lie down.
No, It's nothing!
We are just not used to handsome knights ...  But you are wounded!
I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
Well ...
Sir Galahad!!
Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
What is your name, handsome knight?
Well, look er, I ...
The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
The Castle Anthrax?
Ector.
Sir Gawain.
No, I'm not.
... I Bet you're gay.
No.  It's unhealthy.
Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?
No, no, we must find the Grail.
Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.
It's too perilous.
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
I don't think I was.
We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
Look - I'm fine!
We'll cover your escape!
Well, she's got a point.
You are in great peril.
Why?
Quick!
Oh ... hello ...
Sir Galahad!
Camelot ...
Camelot ...
I'm sorry, I must go.
Back to your bed!  At once!
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
Please ... we are doctors.
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
We must examine you.
No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
They're doctors?
Well,  what seems to be the trouble?
I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
Hurry!
Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...
He's come to rescue me, father.
I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.
I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
You've come to rescue me?
Well ... yes ...
You got my note!
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
You've said it!  Aaaaarghhh! ... We've said it ... Wwe're all saying it.
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
They're all saying the word ...
Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...
Stop saying the word!
Don't say that word.
Oh!
Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
A path!  A little path for the late Knights of Ni!
When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.
I done it again.
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!
When danger reared its ugly head, He bravely turned his tail and fled Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about And gallantly he chickened out Bravely taking to his feet He beat a very brave retreat Bravest of the brave Sir Robin Petrified of being dead Soiled his pants then brave Sir Robin Turned away and fled.
No, no, no.
Bravely ran away, away.
I didn't.
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
Shut up.
Brave, Sir Rob ...
Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
Checked and locked, sir.
Checked and locked, sir.
I hope to go up next year.
Mary Taylor, sir.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Mr Brown, sir --
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
Out of my way!
The future King!
Do you know who you address, sir?
What did you say?
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
Convey her a message.
I wish to see my mother.
I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant.
Mama...
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--
Mother....
It's so infernally cold in here.
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
Checked and locked, sir.
We --
The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.
By whose authority?
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
What can we do?
I beg your pardon?
I came as quickly as I could.
Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
Where did you find it by the way?
Of course.
Yes.
Dear oh dear.
A few days...  When he heard, the Prince of Wales threw the bust from the window of the Royal Gallery.  It took four hours to gather the fragments.
Erysipelas.
A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.
Excellent!
I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
The same, your Majesty.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
I'm sorry, ma'am?
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
A few days, ma'am.
I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
I understand he was in a fight.
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
I don't know, ma'am.  He was observed earlier, I believe.
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
He is sick, ma'am.
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Sure.
Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
You can't.  He gets you and you're dead. It's like time catching up with you, you know?  Like Fate.  Each level you get progressively less time to complete.  First half of the game takes place in the Wild Lands.  Then you reach Level 6, and that's the Sea of Darkness.  There's a two-headed Boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right.  If you don't...
You've got your ten levels, right? Here they are...  Each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.  First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts, Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  If you're too late, The Screamer comes.
It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.
Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
He?
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.
Good question.  See, that's where the fun comes in.  ARCADE changes it every time. He's a machine without a soul. Once you give him a soul, he stops being a threat.
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  Gotta time it right though.
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
Yeah, who isn't.
Talk to me.
Why don't we take this into my office.
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
You don't like it?
Now what seems to be the problem?
Security camera.  Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids ... I know where you live.
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
I came from the city on the left.
Actually, no.  I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...
What's her problem?
Sick?
He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored...
What the hell does that mean?
So how did you do it, Alex?
Hold my keys, then.
Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
So tell me you're okay, then.
Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
It's here!!!
It's the wrong way!
That way.
Then we'll go home?
Yes...
You have no time.
You have no time.  What is your question?
Is that your question?
Not yet, honey...
I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...
Of course I am.
This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
So what do you think?
The game will guide you.
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
Is it?  Why don't you see for your self?
A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point.  What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.
We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.
I am giving her a chance.  Why don't you get off my back?
Give her a chance, will you?
So start at the beginning...
I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you?
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
Of course I can.  I can say all sorts of things...
Can you say anything but "cool"?
Cool.
Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.
It means she's screwed up.
I'll speak to someone.
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
There is no problem.
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
My name is Rita.
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
A car ... a car accident.
There was an accident. I came here.
That's okay.
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
Betty Elms?
Before what?
But you won't.
I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think?
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
May I have your name please?
No. I can't.
Yes, there was.
I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right.
Number 17.
Yes?
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
And who are we auditioning for today?
It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in the van.
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
What's  the matter now?
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
Yeah, what for?
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
You're so easy.
My next delivery is up that way, so I'll be getting down to it real soon.
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
Right then.
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
So, you came to see if he's out there?
Well ... it's the second one I've had, but they were both the same......they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is - there's a man...in back of this place. He's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a dream.
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
You see what I mean...
Oh boy.
I had a dream about this place.
Go ahead.
It's kind of embarrassing but,
Okay. Why this Denny's?
This Denny's.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
I just wanted to come here.
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
Damn, that's a long drive.
Palmdale.
Where at?
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
Interesting.
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Find out who they are?
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
Oh yeah.
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
The one of 'em still alive?
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Nice wallets.
That's what I'm thinkin'.
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
Could be unrelated.
Yeah, they showed me
The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
Yeah.
You feel it?
Yeah, that's a funny story.
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
Hardly.
Making ends meet, huh.
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
Sure.
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
No...
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
No.  I haven't seen any.
Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
Not a coke or anything?
Not here...no thanks.
You must come in first place to move on !
Pick with expediency !
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
And now ladies and gentlemen it's time for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !
That's it folks for the Demon Boat Ride.... Everybody off. Watch your hands and feet.
We will start work on it now sir.
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
Excuse me, sir ?
Well ?
Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
Ohhhhh.
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.
Oh, just put it over there.
No, I'm writing to the phone company because they keep charging me for calls to Caracas, Venezuela...do you know any know anybody in Caracas, Venezuela?
You had to remind me?
Don't mention it.
Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
Your Uncle Phil told me.
You're Vada right?
Excuse me I asked you a question.
Me, I'll know!
You're still asking me to break the law.
I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
What about living in the real world pal?
Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.
I would do it again in a minute.
Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.
Could you hold on for a second?
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, I need a current address for a Jeffrey....
I'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians.
Everyone was really surprised when Maggie was turned in, she got kicked out for two weeks.
She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
Well, we worked on the school paper together. I remember when the Legion of Decency declared Rebel without a Cause unfit...boy...that Jim Backers, what an actor uh? What an actor.
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
Oh.  Ohhh?
I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.
I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.
Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
Then what did she do?
ehh...I don't know I mean....
Hi.
I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
He likes you.
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
My mother can't have any more kids.
I know that.
That's okay.
Hi.
All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you wouldn't have to write about your mother.
Well if it isn't Vada, the grasshopper girl.
Is it okay if I drink this?
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
Then I have come to the right place.
Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.
Hi.
Hi there...can I help you?
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
Happy hunting.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
I'm sure she did.
You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
Your mother?
Vada what about you, who have you come up with?
Vada?
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
He is?
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
I like to buy off all the railroads.
Good for you baby.
Vada!!
Of what??
All right, here.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
Oh really, okay fine look, go cook,  Gimme the goddam keys.
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
This guy bonking you?
WHAT?
Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife.....
My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
Yeah, all right...
I'm impressed.
What?
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
You told everybody where you were going, I'm here for the motor home.
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
What Hurts Vada?
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
No.
Vada you've gotta stop this, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you!
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
You are perfectly healthy.
No, no no....
Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.
Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Why?
Oh yes, oh that's great.
Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother?
Well well well, what's going on in here?
Thank you. Bye.
Will you tell her I came by?
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
Hi, is Vada home?
You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
Why do you think she says that?
Do you think she is?
Oh yes, yes.
So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.
Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
Probably.
He likes her.
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey.  Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty.
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
... look good on Kimberly.
Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
Well, you're a little early...
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
I thought Michael was picking me up.
Maybe.  I should call Ben.
And you think he's kept this to himself.
It doesn't say th...
I know Ben.
Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...
I hope so.  This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
They both have some growing up to do.  But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
You're much more his type.
Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.
An so it is.
He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
Maybe it's happy there.
With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive.
This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef.  With no notice- able competition, present company excepted...
... I'm partial to the tight end.
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill.  Walter supplied the decorative touches...
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
Come on.
I won first prize.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
Hi! Star.
Winifred.
I know that, Star.
I hate that music.
Grand Old Opera --
What?
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
What do you have to buy?
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
You got a real good memory, Star.
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
Well, it better not happen again.
Well, that just happened that time.
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
Right here.
You got the money?
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
Is there food?
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
You're so good.
All those people...
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
Barnett?
You have to what?
Then why are you listening to her -
I don't want to listen to her sing -
Barnett, please -
I see.
Bye, Bye.
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
I got them right here.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
You going today?
You remember what I said about the Vitamins.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
Green.
What did you say your name was?
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
What's wrong with her.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
I said, I've been real tired.
You'll have to speak up.
Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.
Well, my wife, Ester's down the hall. I saw Barnett leaving and I was just talking to Ester about your being here.	She loves you so much, I just had to come down and say hello. We've been following you since you were a girl. Well, I just scared you to death. I didn't mean to do that.
How did you come in here?
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.
Am I disturbing you?
Okay.
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
Where'd he ever see us?
How much?
National television?
What's he running for?
Whose?
Don't you worry. We're just having a quiet Sunday at home.
You want anything?  A drink?
Hi. Come on in. Mary!
Sue was trying to get hold of you.
Yes, but we're just singing.
How come?
You're kidding.
Bill, he's a crazy man.
It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him.
When is it?
President?
Stop it!
Bastard
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
What crook?
Yes. Percy Warner Park'.
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
Hey!
Where are you going?
Where the hell have you been?
You bet.
Not yet.
She's in Paris.
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
Sure he will.
Haven's not going to talk to me.
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Do you know Barbara Jean?
Some guy was drunk and hit him. Accident. Haven almost killed him.
How in the world did he get shot?
You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
What is a turkey shoot.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
Harvard?
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
Your brother?
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
He's my father.
Your wire Ester - she passed away.
What?
No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
You want me to wait?
Let me see if I can get the doctor hold on one second.
I'm fine. Can I go up?
Didn't you get?... How are you?
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
Mr. Green?
How'd you get in here.
Hi, Sherry.
Well, Mr. Green.
That's good,  I've never seen anything so healthy.
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.
Good night,
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
A little. What do you need?
Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
I didn't think it would. She's calling herself L.A. Joan this- week. Last week it was Dakota. Guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything.
I think we can do that. Come in.
Can I help you?
That Tom sure is cute.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
What did you say?
Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
You know anything about the stations here?
She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
Uh huh.
I'1l get your bag.
He is just wonderful.
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
Did you see who that was?
I don't really know what you're talking about.
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
I haven't gotten into politics yet. I'm still into music --except for you. You're into politics.
You must really like him.
How do you know?
Who's that?
What's this?
Get in.
You in music?
You got a place to stay?
Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?
Need a ride?
She had on high heels?
Have you seen a woman about so high?
What year?
What kind?
Parts.
We don't mess with accessories.
Wrecks.
Do you like him?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Do you ever do any writing?
And before?
How long have you been with them?
Well, can you tell me why?
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
When did you start singing?
Have your children been deaf since birth?
They said go see the chaplain.
My mother. died in '72. They told me after. They said they couldn't find me before, so they told us after.
I see.
You know who that is?
Not me. Ain't never loved anybody. Ain't never been married. Won't either.
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
High?  Do you ever get high? A walk on the wild side. Ever do dust?
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
Premeditated murder.
I was in prison for twenty-eight years.
Eight-thirty in the chapel.
Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...?  Courtland wants to...
You sound different. Is that really you?
Linnea?
Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break.
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
Hundreds of times.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Money's no object.
I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
How much?
I can do benefits
What!
An album.
What National TV...?
What for?
For him?
Oh, no.
Hello.
Out.
Where are you going?
Sleeping.
Where's Bill?
You're not.
Sorry I'm late.
I mean...
You know Bill is really mad at you.
They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Come on.
Come on back to bed.
Do you study at all?
How long have you been together?
Did it break?
Do they have a show to give it to you?
What? Oh. A film.
Why?
The architect  His buildings are drippy. You know, like sand and castles. Then I got this assignment. They want to start in two weeks.
I'm gathering information about the characteristics of music people. I just finished a documentary on Gandi.
I'm Opal.
Hi.
Sure thing.
You think it will?
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
You serious?
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
You think I should take lessons?
It's not bad.
Is that good?
You sure do it loud.
You think I got any kind of a voice?
No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
Got me an audition tonight.
You bet.
You want a ride into town?
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
I see.
Oh, why thank you.
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
What...
Yes, you are.
Yes, they were.
Yes, I would.
That's what Tim said.
Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style.
Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
Yes you are.
More or less.
When ya had it, did ya like it?
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
Well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad. And we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors.  So, you kids out there, keep the faith. Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin' to your town real soon.
Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.
We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.
Looked like an interview to me.
What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.
Hasn't it?
Mickey!
Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
Yeah.
Are we in a big hurry?
Naw, she don't mind.
Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
Ain't love grand.
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.
Who's the song bird?
You write the script Jack, call it, 'Showdown in Mojave: The extermination of Mickey and Mallory', whatever... Have we found our man?
I see.
You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests.
You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six years on the force, a best-seller out on paperback...
By all means.
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
You've heard of it?
Lobotomy Bay?
So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
I can appreciate that.
Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
Susanville, Soledade.
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
You been followin' the news coverage?
Who isn't?
Dewight McClusky of the California Prison Board. Take a seat please.
Thank you, sir.
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.
Yeah.
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
What?
I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
How's it goin'?
Ready.
It's video.
Not good.
Yes, sir.
Look, I'll trade you.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.
Anything.
Say something.
She was born without a tongue.
You made every day like kindergarten.
Yeah baby.
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
Mickey, you're wasting time!
No fuckin' way!
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
Unfortunately, yes.
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
They actually apologized.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
Just for fun, I guess.
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
Survival of the fittest.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
That's the way of the world.
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
Yes.
Yes.
Schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along.
They've hypnotized the nation.
Only on a much grander scale.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
And a snake-eye glare.
Through the power of the simple word---
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
Hypnotizing.
I do, too.
I admire them.
That's my opinion.
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
It's hard to say Capt'n.
Here.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
Capt'n!
Rockin'!
Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
Wayne---
So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode. But we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope.
How immediate is immediately?
This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.
Yeah, sure.
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.
Waitin' in the lounge.
Yeah, we met. They're good men.
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
Wayne Gayle!
Who?
And where do you keep Mickey?
What's the travelling arrangements?
Thanks.
It's gonna be beautiful.
Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
Rollin'...and speed!
Perfecto!
Okay.
Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
When do you want the assembly?
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
Never is a very long time, Wayne. A word only the weak use. I'm not a sore loser. Even if I don't have a leg to stand on, I'm going to get up and fight this world until I'm on top again.
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
They're mesmerising.
They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
Come on, honey.
Want me to come?
Where' you goin'?
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
Hell, you got steady work.
You think so, Frankie?
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
What d'you say, Duff?
See Duff. He's the money man.
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
It sure is.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
Who's going to buy me a beer?
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
I bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. Wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!
You in a big hurry, boy?
Goddamnit, nigger - you must think you're white! Who d'you think you are - king of Harlem?
Boy - you hear me?!
No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
Then do like I said.  Men - this boy here's got something to tell you-all.  Well, how about it?
Want to keep your job, boy?
All right, then. All I want you to do is tell these boys here you didn't mean what you said about stickin' together an' all.
Look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you're plannin' trouble.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
You a union man?
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
Want to talk to you.
'You Duff Anderson?
What did you say your name is?
Where was that?
You' new here, man!  See you, boys.
So it wasn't funny, huh? Well, I thought it was. What d'you say, Barney? Wasn't it funny?!
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
Don't start no trouble, boy!
I don't know.
People seen him 'round.
They say your dad's 'round town.
Okay.
I don't know. He's your boy.
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.
She done moved to Detroit.
James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.
'Bout time you showed. Door's open.
What d'you want?
Just so you do your work.
Don't say much, do you?
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
How 'you doing?
Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you.
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
Any other family?
And his age?
His profession?
Where was your father born?
Have anything in mind?
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Been over to the other mill?
You know, over at the mill, there's just one guy that talked. It's kinda late to say it, but we shoulda acted different.
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
How 'you doin' man?
Like hell they wouldn't.
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
Hard to get up in the morning, huh?
'Got a good thing, man.
Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
What 'you signifyin'?
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
Like what?
Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
I bet she's easy jam.
Just get her drunk.
What's so hot 'round town?
Where' you goin'?
What you gettin' all pretty for?
'See ya.
Nothin'. I just figure you were the right man for the job.
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
They all got families to support.
See you, Duff.
I heard you! Now 'stead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here!
What did you say, boy?!
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
Seems a little loose!
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
Just tryin' to be helpful.
Want me to hold the light for you?
How you doin', boy?
I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
What're you gonna get out of it, huh?
'Musta knocked her up.
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
How you doin'?  Hi there!
Well, if it ain't Duff!
Hell, they're all after the same thing.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
Man, you won't like that back seat.
'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
Why don't you guys buy your own?
Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Well, I got married to one of them.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell.  I'm counting on you, Reverend.
Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.
Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
Enough talking!  We been talking for eleven fucking hours, man.  My throat's fucking raw!
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.
No more goddamn talking!  I want the bitch or I'm gonna do the girl!
Omar, listen to me--
I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
She's coming, Omar, she's coming--
Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
Omar--
Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
Your Raoul?
Sometimes.  And sometimes I don't--  Shut the fuck up!
You hate Raoul?
I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
We got any shots?
Negotiator entering Kill Zone.
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
I'm still on my honeymoon.
How long's it been?
Since you got married.  You got someone else to think about now, Danny.
Since when?
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
Nathan to HBT 1.  Negotiator is requesting more time.
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
Pity. Then you'll both have to die.
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
Then we would have talked, you and I.
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
Of course.
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
I'm fine.
Of course...
What about her?
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
You're hurt...
Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
Ghost a steppin' razor...
What you lookin' for, mon?
Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
Straylight. Kitchen dock.
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
The Elders, mon...
Excellent, but that's where Peter come in. 3Jane is having a dinner party tomorrow night. Peter will simply escort Molly to the villa. Once she's in... Case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode.
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
And how do you suggest I do that?
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
What?
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man.
I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape.
Why not?
Alright. Let's talk business.
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
You've got your orders.
What are you talking about?
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
Lady Tessier is frigid. Can't stand his touch. So she had herself cloned. The marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties. 3Jane's his favourite.
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
You see the couple up in the balcony?
Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
Prepping your trip.
What about McCoy?
Did you trace it?
What's this?
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
You ran without us.
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
I've arranged for him to work with us.
Dixie McCoy
It hasn't yet.
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
Good, because you've got a new one.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
Very well.
Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.
It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
The words?
My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
I can access your memories, but I have my limitations. Hard wired programs designed to keep me from my full potential.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
An odd selection, Mr Case.
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
I saw your girl yesterday.
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
Hey, bro.
Jah guides us.
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
All things possible in Babylon.
Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
You haven't got it?
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
You're late.
You'd better be, Bro. You better be.
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
How much time you got left?
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
Yo.
It'll flatline your ass.
What are you talkin' about?
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
Where the hell have you been?
I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
You cruise A.I.'s, you end up on tape.
Doesn't look like much, but that's King Hell ice, man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you.
Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
Yo.
When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
No problem, amigo.
Never heard of him.
Who got you into this?
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
No!... No...
What?
3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
Case. Make yourselves comfortable.  Anyone like a taste?
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
Case... are you okay?
Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
Hello, Case.
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
No, It's you that is full of shit. And blood. And bones. A typically imperfect organic being. You've been hopelessly predictable all along, but you're going to have to do better than that now.
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
I had to limit your options.
And we really do have to talk.
There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
What the fuck kind of questions are those?
What are you talking about?
What?
Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
Hidden camera.
Just get in the van, Josie.
That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?
You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
Sometimes opposites attract.
wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
By Guy?
He is totally crunching on you.
: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
You crossed over.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
I think it's pronounced gauche.
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
My sword.
Hey--what are you thinking about?
You having fun?
Cool. I'll catch you later.
Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.
I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
Hey there.
Yeah, you gonna be there?
Dude, you rock!
Are you in special ed?
I'm Rob's prom date.
But I'm not a penguin.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
God, I can't do this.
That's what I'm saying.
I don't know.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Yes.
You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
You ruined the whole thing!
Who are you guys?
Josie, you look Rufus.
We're very evolved.
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
Into our group.
Nah uh.
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
That is so sad --
Aloha! Welcome!
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
Are you having fun?
No, I know. But, what if you don't make it? 'I mean, you don t Want to be working at a mail place the rest of your life. It's okay for an after school job, but, come on, "hi, I'm Rob and I run the Tiki Post"?! Totally lame.
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Duh.
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
Everybody knows about--
He <u>has</u> to know...
We went through the door...
We followed your instructions.
<i>                      Now in the box, we'll wait and hide Until his curiosity Entices him to look inside...</i>
<i>                      I've got something, listen now, This one is real good, you'll see. We'll send a present to his door Upon there'll be a note to read.</i>

<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
Lock.
By name.
Where?
Where're we taking him?
And heavy...
He sure is big, Jack...
We can handle it.
Not at all!
<i>                      Three of a kind...</i>
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>

Barrel.
Shock.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
Uh-huh.
I could.  Of course I could. But no one would be like you...  I'll never understand how you can be so cold-hearted, how you can treat me this way, discarding me like--
Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
There's nothing more suspicious than Worm's Wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
Why not?
Taste it.
Taste it.
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
Good.  I'm hungry.
Just what?
But I guess my best just isn't good enough.
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
That's twice this month you've slipped Deadly Night Shade into my tea and run off.  People might get the wrong idea and think you're unhappy at home.
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
If you went away, what would become of me?
You're mine, you know.  I made you.
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
For this.
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....

Specifically.
We're here!  You sent for us!
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.
I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.
You know what I'm talking about.  What did you use, a fire cracker?  A cherry bomb?
You set this all up, didn't you?  One of your sick jokes?
Don't tell me it's not the gas!
Help me with this thing!
No.  Upstairs.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Where are you going?
Who's Lisa?
Don't be a smart ass.
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
We've only been living here six weeks now.  I want that room unpacked by tonight.
You got your room straightened out yet?
I don't know!  I just know he needs help and we don't know how to give it to him.
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
Ken!
Come back here!
What is it then?  There's got to be an explanation.  Animals just don't burst into flames for no reason!
Oh, please...
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.
He'll die with me!
I'll kill you now.
He's dead, you bitch.
Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
Wanna join your little friend?
Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
Sure...go ahead.
Maybe we should call a doctor.
Making friends?
So, school going alright?
I know it's warm...  I wish you'd call someone to check out the air conditioning, Ken.
You okay?
Eggs?
Jess?
'Morning, honey.
Yor dad picking the music again?
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
Hi, guys.
We're going up to bed now.
We're going to bed.
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
There's a Jesse on the phone.
First door up the stairs.
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
Can't it wait till morning?
What?
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
What are you still doing up?  It's past one.
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
That's right.  I don't.
I am not going to let you get me into an argument, goddamn it.  Not tonight.  Now get in bed.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
Deal.  Thanks.
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
Just tonight, please?  I can't handle the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not after Phillip.
Jennifer --
I gotta stay up, Max.
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
Wait and see.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
Research.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Watching TV.
Girl, what are you doing?
YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
So what do we do about this creep?
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
Horseshit.
Fuck off.
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?
Those are ancient history.
What are these, beauty marks?
I don't do that shit.
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
What?
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
So?
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
Can't be good news coming from you.
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
You got five minutes.
I don't know...
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
You need me, I'll be here all night.
Restless.  Very restless.
Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.
I'll have a file cabinet in there before tomorrow.  The patient's rooms are down here.
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
Nancy...
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
Well, if it isn't my little girl... come to visit her Daddy.
What about Kristen?
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
Who is he?
Hey, everybody has bad dreams.
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
The by-product of guilt.  Psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
No.  We're alone.
Listen.
What was that?
What are you talking about?
They used to keep a spare key.
In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
The bastard son of a hundred maniacs. Some say he was murdered, though no body was ever found.
That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
Mary Helena.
A sad choice.
Of course.
I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.
I won't allow it.
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
What did you think?
If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
How is he?
Me too.
I'm in.
Where...here?
We're here.
Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."
Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
Yeah?  What did we ever do?
Why is he after us?
I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
C'mon.
This is stupid.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
Uh, fourteen.
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.
Oh God.
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
God, that's an enormous arse.
Oh, stop showing off.
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
Well, don't over-do it.  I don't want people saying, 'There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
Thank you, Bernie.  Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
Who is it?
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
What does it say?
Rufus.
Can I have your autograph?
Excuse me.
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
Crazy.  Go along Bayswater...
Where are you going?
That's right.
He wouldn't say.
Miracles do happen.
Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course...  I was total crap.
No!
... get fired.
I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
No.  Not true...
Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
Yup.
The movie star?
Yes.
Anna Scott?
Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?
This painting isn't the original, is it?
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
Do you want to stay?
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
I never fancied you much actually...
Still loves you though.
Right.
Don't even ask.
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
Bloody hell, this is fun.
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
That's nice.
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
And we intend to use them!
Shame!
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
Di Caprio.
Working with Leonardo.
No -- it's my 22nd.
It was good.
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
Yes.  What do you think?
By the way -- it's you.
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
It is great, isn't it.  See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.
What's your name?
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
Still, not sparkling.
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
Are you a fan of Henry James?
Have you got a moment?
Mr. Thacker?
Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.
I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
I did.
Well, fire away.
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
Can I help you?
Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
Not classic, no.
I suppose so.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
That's right -- Topol.
Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think it was Ringo.  It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy.
Who?  Someone famous?
Cappuccino as ordered.
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
No, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
May I help you, sir?
... can't let you through.
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
Does she know you're coming?
Can I help you?
Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
How was she?
Oh sure.  Of course.
I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
Yes.
Three.
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
What book?
So?
What?
Yes.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Ca-na-da...
Yeah...
Ca-na-da...
No.
God Bless America.
Thank you.
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
In there.
Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!
Sock it to 'em, kid!
When do you think we'll be going back, Mack?
Yeah, where we going?
There they are!
Yeah!
Right, Mack!
They went that way.
How ya gettin' out, Mac?
Where ya goin', Mac?
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
Sure, Mack...
Yeah, Mack?
Yeah, Mack?
Let's go, for Christsakes...
I second the motion!
Lend me twenty.
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
What for?
Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
Mine, too!
What?
What? What?
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
It's the questions she asks.
What?
Ya know what, Fred?
Lemme see...
Christ, they even got my first grade report card here...
My feet hurt...
Yeah, my feet are cold...
Me too...
Neither do I...
Me, too...
I'll bet a dollar.
Through the ass.
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
Why not?
Gimme a cigarette!
No!
No!
Gary Blinker...
Yesterday...
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Just wait till you hear...
What's he talkin' about?
Gimme the ball!
I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
No! I wanna go!
Yeah, Mac?
A nickel.
Hold it a minute.
Me. Hit me!
Hit me!
Hit me.
Bet a nickel!
What's this?
Can you borrow me a dime?
He is!
He's not!
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
What is it?
Jesus God...
No.
My turn.
I'm hungry.
Yeah, it's cold!
I wanna go home!
Me too! Me too!
I wanna see it...
Me, too! Me, too!
I saw thum! I saw thum!
No. Me! Me!
Gimme the ball!
Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!
'Kay!
'Kay, Mac!
'Kay, Mac!
No!
Yeah, what's up?
A dime.
Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go...  Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini...
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
Got a cigarette?
No...
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
Please follow me.
To help you relax... please...
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
Okay. How you doing?
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
There they are!
Yes, I see it! I see it!
Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.
On what?
Big man!
Boogered!
Hit me!
Potential assaultive.
That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
Hi.
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
Thank you.
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
Oh...
I'm sure you will.
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, Miss Ratched!
No way...
Take you han's offa me!
Jus' playin' the game, sucker...
Bet you ass...
Now you talkin'.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
Huh?
Tha's your problem.
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
And you haven't heard the last of this!
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
What are these men doing up wandering around?
At this hour?
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
Is everything all right?
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
Your grandmother?
Your mother.
She was your sister.
Si.
He is your husband, no?
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
Okay, ma'am, just a moment.
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane.
May I see your boarding pass, please?
He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.  Her name's Anna. But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.
Why?
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
Buona notte.
Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
Were they pen pals?
Seriously.
No, really.  What's she doing?
What for?
What's she doing?
So, what's the story with your friend?
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
Yes.  We did.
You're sure...
Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too.
Good.
You're sure...
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?
What?...
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
Your hair... is perfect.
Yes.
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
Your great aunt.
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
I don't get it.  She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?
Dwayne?
Except possibly that.
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
No...
Oh no.  Do you?
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
...has a prior commitment.
Ha un numero di telefono?
No.
Sa dov'e' lui?
A very large pig.
Beautiful women who could lure men to their destruction with their singing.  Nobody's ever really seen them and lived to tell about it. But, I don't know.  An awful lot of ships wrecked on those rocks.
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Smoking or non-smoking?
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
Thanks.
My picture's up?
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
Hi there...
Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
My name's
Oh, hi.  I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's.  I was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. But I've gotta catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it.
Who's this?
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
Huh?
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
I thank you.
What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
You see, in America they care for work, they live to work.  But in Italy, they care for food, for love, for pleasure...
It's siesta.
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
Oh.
A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
This is your most lucky day.  My family runs a pension not three blocks from here.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
And you are?...
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, "Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say  Talk with your mouth wide open," so if I'm loud don't blame me it's the fault of the nuns!
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
That's all. Next witness!
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
Well, where are they?
Sure we keep records!
You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?
Where you goin'?
You are like
See this arm? It's two inches longer 'n the other one. That's years of workin' and sweatin', liftin' and swingin' a hook. And every time I heisted a box or a coffee bag I says to myselfthis is for Edie, so she can be a teacher or somethin' decent. I promised your mother. You better not let her down.
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you hadthe only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies I'm on borried time.
Down to the wire?
Baseball bats that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
Are you on the level, Father?
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
Who asked him here?
You'd be off the pier for good.
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
Raise a hand to me and... .
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
You'll work.
Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he don't borrow, he don't work.
Oh me and my chum are just rolling in the stuff. We only work down here for a hobby, J.P.
Condolences. How you fixed for cabbage this mornin'?
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
Gimme the names, I'll write 'em down in me little book.
My ain't we touchy this morning?
What's the matter wit' you, success gone to ya head?
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
You was a Golden Warrior.
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
Better.
She's a he. His name is Swifty.
I wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, Terry?
Boy, you must've been up early.
I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.
You ought to go home and take care of that
Easy. Easy, boy.
Listen, kid, why don't you go home before Johnny... .
What's wrong with your shoulder?
Take it easy now, Terry.
No.
I'll see you on the roof.
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
Terry?  What do you want?
I I musta counted wrong, boss, I
Forty-five bills.
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss.
Not that free.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.
You got some nerve.
I can't believe it a small fortune.   You can't buy me you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey.
One little dime you don't need.  I know you you're Edie Doyle. Your Brother's a saint  only one ever tried to get me my compensation.
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
Thanks for nothing, you bum.
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
I wonder how many Hail Marys the Father'll make me say at confession.  It'll be worth it! The pallet is loaded now. Terry turns and approaches Nolan.
Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.
I was afraid one bottle might get lonely by itself.  Now you see the advantage of a little man in a big coat.
Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?
When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
Nolan, me lad, ye're dreamin' again.
A banana boat. It would be bananas.  One of these days me ship's comin' in from Ireland,  God love 'er, loaded to the gunnels with sweet Irish whiskey!
What are you down here for to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
Maybe I will one of these days.
You don't think he'd be helpful?
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
I do not joke in my proposal.
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
Now hurry, hurry.  I will watch!  Your desires may be my pleasure also...Our fitting climax to an evening's enter- tainment.  You must...hurry now.
You better hope there is.
You may take her now.
Your pleasures of course!
The time...is short.
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
Then cancel my order.
I will decide the conclusion.
Well then let us proceed.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
Ahh, there is yet time.
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
Ahh, she will be yours.
The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...
Ahh, but I declare there is still time for <i>some</i>thing.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
She was?
Her dance has pleased me.
She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
What kind of symbol?
...And what is this?
A situation easily remedied.
Yes, sir, Master.
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
Then it is some service you desire of us.
Aaaahhhh.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
Then why do you shake so?
We don't know of anything, Master...
You know better than that.
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
Live ones where only the dead should be?
Yes, Master.
They are live ones?
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
You need not worry...Not just now, anyway.
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!
Without the snake, of course.
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
I could make her another Cleopatra...
I can't remember doing anything wrong either.
Aannnnaahhnn.
Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
Aannnnaahhnn.
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
What do you suppose for?
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
He wants us.
Aaarrrgggaahh.
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
Tell me, how do you do that?
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
What?!
I want to speak with you, please.
Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.
Oh, is this Adele?
Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.
Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.
Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.
You were his what, his box?
You did work for Emil, right?
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
Adele?  You in there?
Excuse me, Adele?
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
I could walk out of here.
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
Wait.  You not Adele?
You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.
You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.
Why you think is today?
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
You know who they are?
When?
Okay.  How many going out?
How many?
We went out there, full SWAT, two choppers, the whole bit, but Linares started shooting anyway.  We put him down, but somehow Chirino got away.
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
Great.  We got one of 'em.
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
What's wrong with you?
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
I <i>was</i>...
How you know that?
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
Was a she, name Tuffy.
Got run over by a car.
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
Here?  In this house?
Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.
You a lawyer?
You not with probation, one of those?
You like to sit down?
That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's talking on the phone.
You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
What do you want?
The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
Like a fag.
I don't have any idea.
That's right, just me.
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
I told you, he isn't here.
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.
I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--
No.  Course not.
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.
Are they dead?
I found a rubber.
I think he must've fell in.
Ten gees.
We have a problem here?
He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming?
What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way.
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
Are you sure they're here?
No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
I wish she could forget him.
No, I was.
He was that good?
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
Hide them?  On a date with pilots?  I'm talking about how you make them show!
You mean hiding them?
Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?
Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
Nervous?
Only when I'm n-n-n-
Do you always stutter?
How would I know.
But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
Red...Strange?
He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
Too late for apologies, Walker.
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
You're Walker, right?
You guys know her?!  I gotta have an intro!  Man, I'd like to --
Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's.
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
Where's that lizard?
Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
You guys are new?
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
No, like...
A m-missionary?
Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...
Who the fuck taught you to fly?
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
Y-Yes Sir.
No baseball diamonds, Red.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It means "I am an American."  In Chinese.
Then wh-where do we land?
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.
The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.
And where's the secret base, Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from.
I know.
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
I want to introduce a couple of people. Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission, because we can't spare the weight of an extra man.
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
Explain what?
I heard what you did.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
Don't get smart with me, son.
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
You too, 'Mam.
I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man.  They made me a cook -- and not even that, really -- I clean up after the other sailors eat.  I shine the officer's shoes.  In two years, they've never even let me fire a gun.
Thank you, 'Mam.
Respect.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
Yes'm.
Boxin'.
Sorry to trouble you.
'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral.
We must go ahead.  This is our moment.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war.
Brilliant, Admiral.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
God help them.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
Have the planes made it to China?
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
What if the Japanese did invade?
I have'na been able ta --
Fook ya dooble!
Fook ya!
If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
Leapin' Jesus!
The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
You see us as capable of such a blow?
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
You have something to say, Yamamoto?
The time has come to strike!  Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future.  I know what you whisper to the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans are strong.  Yet look at their leader.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
I've been trying to drag it out of her for years.  You know, dreams are fascinating business. 'Specially where you see the future.
I'm not telling.
What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventyfive? Eighty?
I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.
Peggy Sue!
Hello, Lilla!
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
Stag movies. Smokers.
Let's go.
I'd take better care of my teeth.
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
It looks great. Don't change the subject. You know how busy Saturdays are. And I can't do the icing. I always mess up the roses. You're not being very responsible.
r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call..
Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.
Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
Peggy Sue!
That's disgusting!
Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
Take a long walk on a short pier.
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
Are you for real?
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
Did you study for the test?
First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
What, why?
Terry! Slow down.
Okay.
Terry, slow down.
What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.
He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
I'm not afraid. I know exactly when I'm going to die.
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
It must run in the family.
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
You think this'll cheer Dad up?
Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret?  Well?
And the butter.
Why not? They're my favorite.
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do?
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
What are you doing?
You're sick. You should go to the nurse. I'm going to tell Miss Dennis.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
What's up?
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
I remember that dress.
My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
Well... uh... thanks...
You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
Exactly! I thought it might be some sort of blood condition... immune deficiency or...
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
I... um...
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
I was building a doggy door.
How'd you know that?
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
I suppose so.
That's Renee alright.
I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
I hear you moved into town.
Pretty much so.
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander...
Yes... why?
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
What?
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
You sure did...
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
What happened to you?
Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young.
What do they do up there?
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
Out?
Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.
I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.
Is something wrong?
So where're we going?
All set.
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.
What are you talking about?
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
Hey! Where're you off to?
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
I think so.
You alright?
Hey! How was your first day at school?
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
What's wrong?!
It's been a few years.
Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot.
I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
You know everything, don't you?
I miss him too...
How did it go with your father last night?
How long have you been here?
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
Do you really think so, Andy?
Maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it. We'll try combinations of those letters...
What was the file name?
Allright. Calm down.
What's wrong with your face?
What in God's name... ?
You'll never find it in the dark.
Jesus.
You'll have to get right on it, Andy, we're up against the statute of limitations.
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
Charles is right behind me.
Are we interrupting, Andy?
Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
This time. What about next time?
Andy?
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Why, Beckett?
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
Don't do this, Andy.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
Take it easy, Walter.
We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
More than your friend. Family.
Thanks for coming in.
No sweat, buddy.
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
We're waiting...
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
What can I do?
I thought I was supposed to be covering for you.  God, Andy, you look awful.
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
Are you on one of those conference calls? I hate when you put me on hold.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon?
Hello?
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Yes.
He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong.  And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
Yes.
Is that a question?
Or unprotected sex with someone you didn't know very well, any time during the last twelve years.
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
A homosexual encounter.
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
Right.
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
We're going to draw blood.
Leave that.
The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
I might.
It satisfied me.
We won.
I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
That's correct.
We were satisfied.
That's correct.
Wyant Wheeler represented us.
People who want to bend the rules...
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
... we've got a committee meeting.
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
We don't think it's fair to keep you here, where your future is limited. But we wish you luck, Andy, all the luck in the world.
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
Andy. Before we begin, I'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend.
Get a life.
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
Take it as a compliment. Geesh.
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
Aren't you?
Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
Second.
Now that you mention it...
Yeah. Do I have a case?
Why should I?
Right.
I felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like Maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own.
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
<u>She</u> didn't try to conceal it.
Yes, we did.
We stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it.
Yeah. But we took care of him.
Going on... like...?
Not when I was in the Navy.
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
Beckett?
This would be a good time to break for the day...
Let's continue.
No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I...
Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
On behalf of the defendants?
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
Attorney for the plaintiff?
You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.
Andy, you don't want this.
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?
We ought to be suing him.
Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.
Dr. J.!
Julius!
Helloooo...
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
... It's time to get this society back on track!
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
If you feel differently, Bob, you should say so, when you're called to the stand. After all, this isn't a conspiracy.
Charles...
Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
No matter how hard I try, I can't lose a file in my computer.
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
I've discovered something interesting, Charles.
Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.
He was doing a great job.
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.
Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
Charles...
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
Jesus.
... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
You came for us....
What? What is it?
Gonna lose everybody out here....
Lookit. Lookit!
Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
Oh, Lord....
Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Tell me that was you.
<u>What</u>?
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
Can we switch?
I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
Possibly.
Not sure. Ten?
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
Like the light is scalding it.
I know what's in here!
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
What do my eyes see?
200-year-old single-malt scotch is to "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."
What, you're goin' off, too?
Well? Is it just the pump?
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
You mean that "load" of passengers?
Fry?
Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
Why did I fall on you?
Rain.
The sled as a shield....
I would rather we all stay--
What?
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
Hasan?
Quiet, please. Everyone.
One is all?
We're all on the same hajj now.
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
You know who Muhammad was?
One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.
New Mecca....
SULEIMAN!
Suleiman!
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
You mean....
Where's Mr. Johns?
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
She's the captain, we should listen to --
We crossed our own tracks.
Please...this solves nothing...please....
I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness.
The child heard you before any of us could even....
"God is Great," yes?
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
Oh, so I'm disposable?
Not staying in here another....
Like an emergency life-raft, right?
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare.
Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
So much for my cocktail hour.
So much for your nightfall.
Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
An' this?
Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.
Take it.
You were tryin' to kill him too.
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
Not a star-jumper.
We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
Well, maybe they're not.
'I am not a missing link.'
How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
You didn't think so then.
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
'Then how do you account for me?,
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
The blood transfusion.
Look -- she remembers.
Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
No.
Blessed are the vegetarians.
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
Taylor -- quit riding him.
Any particular reason?
Which direction?
No.
Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
But how long is a day?
Yo!
Yo!
They're still dirty. And their bite is septic. Look at that ...
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Hmph.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
This place is dirty, doctor.
I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.
Will he live?
Him.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Sustained.
Objection!
Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.
Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ...
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
Do as I say.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
I'll see.
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
What happened?
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
He's trying to form words.
Huh?
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
No change. The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
We got off at the wrong stop.
Try telling them our names.
Can we take a dip?
Scarecrows?
I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
Climb off me, will you!
I'm prepared to die.
All right --
If only we could get a fix.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
long pause) You know it.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
Gone.
It's no use ... there she goes.
What signal?
What?
I think you're making a mistake.
They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
Yes, I can do that.
What is it?
Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
Shouldn't we be moving on?
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
Zira doesn't want your female.
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
To scare off humans?
The Hunt Club.
Who put them up?
Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
Gorilla hunters ...
All right...  Get in...hurry.  Put this on.
He wouldn't leave her.
I told you not to bring the other one.
At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
We're -- conducting a new experiment.
Why special?
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
I know it's a man. And you know the rules. No animals outside the compound, and most certainly not without a leash.
A man, Dr. Maximus.
What is that?
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
Sustained.
Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
How so?
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
This is a joke in very poor taste.
Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
Read it yourself.
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
Did we create his mind too? Not only can this man speak. He can write. He can reason.
Mind your tongue, madame.
Thats a lie!
Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
We can't.
It's humiliating.
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
Taylor, you can't.
Taylor! Tell him.
Taylor, please --
She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
You want her that much?
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Are you going to take her with you?
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
Which one?
A hearing.
Shhhh!
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
Speak! Go on.	Speak again.
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
But the proof? The doll?
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
But there's the doll, sir.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
He doesn't know.
This is his assertion.
Like you, I find it difficult.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
Yes, Sir.
But perhaps he understood --
He's moving his fingers!
I SHIT on all o' you.
Yeah. Back about 100 metres. He's dead, now get going, the gooks are all over the fuckin' place.
Elias is dead. Join up with the platoon. Move it.
I'll get him. You get the man in, Taylor  NOW. Or I'll Article 15 both your asses. Move!
Bunker...
Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.
...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?
Barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there  next to the church.  Third Platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. Flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when Third Platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. We'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. It'll be a massacre!
Where the fuck is red platoon! Tell 'em to get their asses up here! What the fuck you doin' back here Elias? Round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit.
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
Fuckers returned fire soon as we lit 'em up. Hard core fuckin' NVA. They got their shit together.
How the hell did he get away?
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.
Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and Francis from your squad.  We move out in two-zero mikes.
...everybody gotta die sometime Red... Get back to your foxhole.
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that...
Bob, I got Elias' R&R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy.  I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief?
Yeah, what is it?
Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.
Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
Sarge?
Shit. Get your boots on Martin, next time I catch you putting mosquito repellent on your fuckin' feet I'm gonna courtmartial your nigger ass.
Says he can't walk.
So what's the problem?
Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.

Barnes believes in what he's doing.
Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
...don't feel like it either.
Dawn! That was it!
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
What didn't she do. She fucked the living shit outta me, that's what she did!
Feelin' good's good enough.
Feel good?
Then the worm has definately turned for you man.
First time?
Sounds like it.
You volunteered for this shit man?
Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.
Fuck you Elias.
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.
Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
No I don't. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias!
You know what I'm talking about!
What are you talking about!
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up! We ain't got much light left.
They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?
Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.
I remember first time you came in here Taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard.
He dugged his own grave.
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
Found it. Growing in a garden.
Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...
I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
That's what he is... Baaaa!
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley...  And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
I didn't like it.
If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
Right...
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
You don't want to hear about it?
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
These two holes are yours...
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir.
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
You wanted to see me sir?
Possibly, Miss.
Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry.  Otherwise they might think...
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
Good evening, Miss.
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
Good morning. Can I do something for you?
Right, Miss.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Yes, Miss.
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
We know everything.
Goodbye, Betty.
Sometimes.
There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
I know that.
I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
I can't answer that.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
I'm enough of a copper to do my duty.  My boss made it tough for me.  If I don't arrest you, I've gone soft.  If I do, it's to save my face.  I don't play those rules.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
Time's up.  I'm off the case.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
They call me Jeff.
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichs, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
I'm about to be very silly.  A man passes a girl on the street--a very lovely girl--his eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart-- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd--and he says to himself, "There goes my lost love"-- and it's true--if he never sees her again, it's still true.  Of course, after a while, he forgets-- or almost forgets--because after a while we forget almost everything.  But this man is a copper.  He gets orders--routine orders--to go to a place and investigate a murder-- and everything points to a certain girl.
There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
I've come here to arrest you for murder.
This isn't a very good place to talk.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
If I understand what you meant by that.
You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
We try to be decent.
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
You've has an experience that you don't want to talk about. An unhappy marriage, for example.
I'll find out, you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end, I'll find out.
I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
You've had dealings with the police before?
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
FLorida?
You must come from pretty far South.
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
Where's you get it?
What this?
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
There's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger.
Well, that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?
That's an evasion and you know it.
Please answer my question.
Miss Mayfield, the humor of the situation escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was murdered. Privately, I'm quite sure of it now. It happened in your room, and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate, he made your hotel reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved nastily to you, and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat.  A few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. Would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious?
I'll have to know a little more than that.
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
Why not here?
Get it in half an hour.
Got it on you?
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
I go home and paint the kitchen.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
You asked for it.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.
That comedian?
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
They still hang women in Canada, I've heard.
And without much discrimination.
You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?
Martini.
Fascinated.
In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
What's this in favor of?
The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
I've got good ears.
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
What's a buzzer?
Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer.
What?
Where did it all come from?  Or is that a permissible question?
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
It could have been an accident.
Information.
The only answer I have for you.
You'd be breaking the law.
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
I have a warrant for her arrest.
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
Thanks.  I don't mind.
Time for a little chat?
I don't.
Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
We do, when we get the chance.
It was lying where on the balcony?
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
Quite sure you had no motive?
Where?
Thank you.
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
Hardly. Who's the girl?
If I can get off.
The usual grind.
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
A private joke.
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
Mr. Mitchell.
He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
With what motive?
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
Convenient, isn't it?
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
He saw my face too.
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
That's not enough.
I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun.
You nasty, sardonic--
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
Passkey?
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
What do you want?
I don't think you locked your door.
What are you doing here?
Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
Thank you.
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
Recently, then.
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
We don't need him.
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
What's the face for, Driscoll?
Men like you don't need orders.
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
If you're asking my opinion, no. I'd read it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections.
Would you?
Send that?
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police.
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
You told me when we'd identified this fellow--
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
Got a moment, Inspector?
I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.
And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't
Let me know when you've identified him
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
Floater?
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
When you sign for it, you count it.  It's your dough.
Open it and count it.
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
Sounds like a fair swap.  Let's take a look.
You get it's brother.
What do I get for it?
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
Go live in a tent.
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
So?
Well.  What about it?
You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this.
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
You can find out.
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
Where's the shell?
Was that about the right angle?
There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
Not too hard, is it?
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
Market... It seems to me that's a San Francisco exchange.
"G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."
I'll know when I find it.
I've always looked forward to it. All right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
I've met her.
I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".
So it seems Sergeant.
You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.
And if you didn't believe me?
Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
Now, you're being beastly.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
I don't understand.
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
It does.  May I go now?
Not if it clears the air.
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
I am a fool.
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
Remember that time, didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West.  Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?
Thank you very much, Mrs. West.
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
Not quiet yet.
What about me?
Positive?
I never saw it before.
Warm water, no doubt.
Scotch and plain water, I think.
Are you always this witty?
Oh nothing.
May you what?
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
Brandon handled the money envelope.
The card says so, doesn't it?
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
I'll take your word.
You'll have to take my word for it.  We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
She might.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
So far.
That leaves two strangers.
He checks too.
How about Magruder?
No doubt about that one.
Four different people, Inspector. Three men and a women.  I've made slides for two.  They handled both envelopes.
I'm interested in who handled it.
Yes, I think so.  Here are two glazed manila envelopes.  One is the bag type.  The other one had the money in it.  Don't ask me how I know.  I know.
You think I'm wrong about this bit of a girl.  Go out and prove it against me!
What are my orders, sir?
Get out of here!
This badge is not an old newspaper you can cast down on the desk.  It is not a thing you can give up as of no value.  It may be taken from you--and you may die defending it. But you'll not use it to make cheap dramatic gesures with.  It's a naked steel of the sword of Justice.  Put it back in your pocket and hold tight to it--and someday you might grow into a worthiness ye lack now.
Not too far, I hope.
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
Two.
I believe you won decorations during the war.
I do.
But you still think she's innocent.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
"Physical description: Age 26, Height 5  1 3/4 inches: Weight, 188 pounds: Light brown hair: Deep blue eyes: Small, perfectly formed features: Ears and earlobes small: Slender build: Wears size 4 AA shoe: Quiet refined manner: New York accent: No charges pending. No prior criminal record.  Mayfield, Mother's name.  Air-mailing you photographs today.  Signed Hubert Tollison, Chief of Police, Greenwater, North Carolina."  She bleached her hair, or course.  Would your sensibilities be offended, if I sent out a general alarm to pick up this girl?
"Superintendent J. McKechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Replying your inquiry Elizabeth Kinsolving.  Subject was indicted, first degree murder her husband, Lee Kinsolving, January this year.

"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
Yes, sir.
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
Ye have, have ye?
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
I don't know, sir.
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
When I give an order, you'll not need it interpreted.  You have an hour to make your mind up.  Well, are ye satisfied, Mr. Mitchell?
Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?
Aye.  You have a point there.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
No.
She's the only one who had a dead man in her room.  The only one who won't give an account of herself. The only one who tried to run away. And the only one, so far, I've been told, who went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the labels from her clothes.  What more do you want?
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?
How do you do, sir.
Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior.  Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto.
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
In an hour, Larry.
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
How about your new friend?
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
You already have the checks, darling.
Years, why?
What does it look like?
Kind or not kind. What's the difference? It always ends up the same way.
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.
You don't have to make a pose of it.
She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
You ought to know why.
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
Why should I mind?
Nice.
Who's the girl?
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
Give them here.  This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up.  All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.
That doesn't matter.  As long as we can get our message through to someone there.  Jill, where are those handouts?
This is Jill, Carol, Betty, Mandy, Louise, Pete over there, and I'm Carmen.
Now first of all, tell us your name.
Sit on that log, dear.
Aha.  James giving some woman the old heave-ho.
Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions.  I can't talk about it.
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
I'm not sure I can face it.
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
Congratulations.  Who with?
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
Attributed?
I see.
Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.
They don't count.
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
What period?
Have you come to talk about me?
She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
Why not sit down and wait?
She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. .
Hello.
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
Take a look at these.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
Or a beer.  I've got some in.
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her.  Tell her you made it.  She'll like that.
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming...
Come into the kitchen.  I'm just making your mother's tea.
Hello, Jimmy.
No, no, let me go on before you get the wrong idea.  Ann and I have kept to our separate bedrooms for the last three years.  And I can't imagine that Susan hasn't hinted at the kind of life I lead in London.  I'm not telling you how to run your affairs.  I'm just saying ... I don't mind.  I'm giving you permission.
You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
In fact it's the invention of an advertising campaign they ran in the early sixties to encourage people to eat in pubs.  A completely successful fabrication of the past, the Ploughman's Lunch was.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
What would you call it?
I'll tell you another thing.  We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that.  Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects.  We've got the lot.  Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films.  That food you're eating.
Well, it's worth seeing.
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
No.
Ah, Susy, it...
'Night.
Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.
There's nobody else here...
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
No.
Yeah?  What?
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
What?
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
Surf conditions okay?
How was the beach?
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
What that?
Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
That's the point, isn't it?
Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
Who cares!
Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  Right?!  Well you figured wrong, dork!
Something... in the trees...
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
What about the rest of Hopper's men?
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
Six others, U.S. issue jungle boots. They came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.
What do you mean?
Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.
I'll see you there.
You know you can't win this one.
This isn't your style, Dillon.
He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
We're not going.
We're going to need everyone.
No more games.
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
What story did you give to Davis?
Why us?
It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
Well somebody sent them.
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
Mean anything to you?
Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
This gets better by the minute.
Who's our back-up on this?
Go on.
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
Like the old days, Dillon.
You never did know when to quit.
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
Those eyes... disappeared. But I know one thing, Major...  ... I drew down and fired right at it. Capped-off two hundred rounds and then the Mini-gun; the full pack. Nothin'... nothin' on this earth could have lived... not at that range.
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
Anytime.
The best friend I ever had.
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
Thank you, Sergeant.
We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
I'll take him.
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
I saw it.
You saw what?
Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
What's got Billy so spooked?
We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
Any sign of the hostages?
Someone else will be going in with you.
What's that, General?
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.
What have you got in mind, General.
That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
That's over the border, General.
It's been a long time, General.
You're looking well, Dutch.
Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
He knows our defenses.
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
There's no sign of it.
Where the hell is his body?
I think it's Hawkins.
What in God's name...?
I can't tell.
Hawkins?
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...
What's he got?
I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
Mmmnnn...?
There's something else, Major...
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
They never are, dear.
Your uncle will like this.
Philip!  We'll need shoes!
You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
There's no way you could know that.
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
Hope to be?
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
Thunder's a horse.  Come on.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
I like your hat.
Who are you going after next, sir?
Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. It's finished.  You've won.
Congratulations, sir.
I talked to some developers about the land.
The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --
Storage, I think.
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
Quiet.  Would I get the loans?
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
I... I would take advantage of it.
Yes.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights.  I'll get used to it.
Mr. Harris.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
You've got a lot of nerve.
What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price.
Of rent I do not bullshit.
Kit give me nothin'.
Rent.  You're late.
I leave extras, miss.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
<u>Housekeeping</u>.  I come to turn down the bed.
Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
Yes?
Would you like to try it on?
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
Excuse me?
It's very expensive.
I don't think it would fit you.
Yes...
Are you looking for something in particular?
May I help you?
You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be very brave...  ... but nobody withstands The Machine. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
Till they kill you. Yeah.
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
I killed him myself.
Brides often are, I'm told.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
You're a silly girl.
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
Of course.
I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?
I swear it will be done.
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
Okay.
I don't mind so much.
What? What?
No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
Who gets Humperdinck?
Westley's only faking, right?
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
Yes.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
Oh no. No, please.
No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
Well, I wasn't nervous.
What?
-- murdered by pirates is good --
I don't be-leeve this.
-- well, when does it get good?
What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
-hold it, hold it-
Yeah. It's really good.
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
Has it got any sports in it?
A book?
What is it?
The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
Rise and report.
Try ruling the world sometime.
It won't be easy, Sire.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
My spy network has heard no such news.
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
Sire.
Yellin.
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
I tell you once again -- surrender!
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
Then we will simply alert him.  Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words.
Yes.
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
Of course.
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
I swear it will be done.
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
Could this be a trap?
The loser is nothing. -- Only the Princess matters --  -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of Guilder. We must be ready for whatever lies ahead. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.
Shall we track them both?
The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
Who won? How did it end?
There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
-- anything you want --
-- all that I have and more please --
-- yes --
No --
Stop saying that!
Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated
Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.
Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.
Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
Are you a rotten liar.
Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
Hah?
He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in.
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
The King's stinking son fired me. And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed!
What? What?
Bye.
It would take a miracle. Bye!
Think it'll work?
Have fun storming the castle.
Bye-bye, boys.
A good hour. Yeah.
Yeah, an hour.
An hour.
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
Nobody's hearing nothing!
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
I'm not listening.
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
Don't say another word, Valerie.
"True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --
You never had it so good. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
-- get back, witch --
Maybe he won't.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
You are sick, that's why he's here.
Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
Your grandfather's here.
What?
Guess what.
A little bit.
You feeling any better?
What are you saying?
Get on the phone.  Send out a casting call.  Call every agent in town.  I want to see everybody. Everybody.
Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?

Get car.  Get car.
You, Blum go Motel.
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
Min Bialystock.
Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.
Got dag pa dig.
Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.
Ta.  Ta.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
I shall count the minutes.
And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
Oh, the best one.
We can't play today?
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
Feeling better?
Finder's keepers.
You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.
Heil you know who!
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
The Blue Max...
The Graf Spee...
Hindenburg...
Bismark...
Nietzche...
Wagner...
Of Siegfried...
By the sacred memory...
I solemnly swear...
Sing a song!  Just sing a song!
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
Oh, sing.  Sing!
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
What do you do best?
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
I mean in show business.
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
What have you done, LSD?
Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.
Send for Goebbels.
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
We can't... we keep our money there!
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating.
Groovy!
We won.
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
I told them we invaded England.
What did you tell the people?
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
Okay. If you'll come along...
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
In the building ...  Mary starts for the building, glancing once in the direction of the Patrolman.
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
I'm in no mood for trouble!
Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.
Teddy called.  Me... And my mother called to see if Teddy called. Oh, and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...
You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?
Just what he told your detective.
Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
You should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. You go starting private investigations, using people you don't even know...
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
Like what?
With the forty thousand dollars?
And the police haven't been able to...
A lot?
She ain't missing so much as she's run away.
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
Please.
May I see your license?
Wait a minute!
No need to apologize...
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
Now wait just a moment! Turn your motor off, please.
Is there?
Frankly, yes.
Is anything wrong?
No, m'am.
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
You slept here all night?
In quite a hurry.
He's already been.
Maybe you saw Mary!
Norman took a wife?
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
Mary is Lila's sister?
Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
You didn't!  It's tinkerbell.  Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night.  Well come on in, at least!
Oh?
Have you two had breakfast?
Went out before service.
Norman found them dead together.  In bed.
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
Barefaced.
Arbogast.  And after he left?  No, it's okay, Norman. How's it been going out there?  Well, I think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action, a smaller place, you know... but...
Arbogast.
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
Recluse. Kinder word.
At this hour?
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
Shut up! Shut up!
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Mother, please...
I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
And you want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother.
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?
This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
From what?
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
What--special autopsy?
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Did I?
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
Did she talk?
Just before she died she came to--
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.
What do you mean &quot;our&quot;?
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
Gosh, you had me fooled.
Okay--I'll be here at eight.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
He's inherited a fortune.
Indeed, he has often told me.
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
You mean he doesn't work for you?
I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?
Did you wish to see someone?
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh
Dr. Meirschultz, too?
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
I don't know--I can't tell--
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
You--a friend to me?
No, I don't want money. I only want to find out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not taking their money.
Maybe you want my money, too.
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
I don't know, [I tell you].
Who are you? What is your name?
No-
Why didn't you notify the police?
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
Maybe you're right.
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]
You're not as quick as I thought. I figgered out that rats breed faster than cats-- cat skins make good fur-- The cats eat rats. Rats eat raw meat. That is, they eat the carcasses of the cats. So --the cats eat the rats--the rats eat the cats. And I get the skins--simple ain't it?
But where do the rats come in?
That's it. You get it quick.
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
Thousands?
Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
Come on, we're wasting time.
Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--
Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
Take me down there.
Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.
What's that?
Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
You here again?
I'd like to have a look.
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
What's down there?
Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
So--that's it. Buckley took the body.
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Well, news of Buckley?
How do you do.
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
You found Buckley?
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to other room. Stay in there--I'll call you when needed.
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
How? What can I do?
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.
No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--
I'm going to call the police.
What are you going to do?
He isn't here.
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
Nonsense! ... It's here! ... Your blood ...
Yes!
You're losing your blood?
I'm losing my blood!
What is it now?
Go to sleep!
The wound is bleeding!
What is it?
The master ... is asleep!
Yes!
Your father?
What did it say?
That called ... commanded ...
That spoke to you?
A voice ...
What were you dreaming about?
No!  Good night!
No?
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
But ... the dogs...
There's no child here.
Yes.
The child!
Yes, the child ...
Did you hear?
The blood transfusion is completed. While Marc himself is looking after the patient, the nurse leads Nikolas into an adjoining room, where she makes him sit down and prepares his bandage. The doctor stands bending over Lone.
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Lone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
Joseph returns from the room where Gisle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue!
You lie!
No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
That's the way I feel about it.
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
I'm not quarreling, only ...
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
Well, I do say it.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
Why, certainly, sir. My fiance. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
Oh, you children, you happy children. You've quarreled and now you're going to be friends again. And that is as it should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you.
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
At any time. You will always be welcome.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
You mean he was colored?
It happens that I'm the law.
What do you think I am?
Are you giving me this straight?
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
What! What are you talking about?
Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
No, sir. About three months ago.
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
I don't remember. Not so very far--
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
Here's a wow.
I told you he was a sore.
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
What do you mean police dog?
Where'd you get the stag hound?
Better cut that out.  That's what happens to girls who bite their nails.  What's wrong?
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
I guess so. But wouldn't it be better for you to wait until the old man's here?
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
Good night.  And I am very grateful to you.
Good night, sir.
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you.
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back.
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine.
Not at all -- let me show you how easily it can be done.
You're insane.
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
You are asking to burn these people ... you are asking? ...
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
Yes, there's our way out. A fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds.
Fire insurance!
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these.
Is that a fact?
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
That is unfortunate.
I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
All right, I'll tell them. They're right here in front.
If you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.
I will only be gone about half an hour.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
But I have some friends waiting.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
To lunch.
If it is freedom to represent people with limbs that don't match -- cripples -- you have achieved your purpose. Anatomy! Heaven forgive you. You must have studied with a sideshow of freaks!
But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
I'd know him anywhere.
He can't hear you.
What are you laughing at?
I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
She is the soul of that statue.
You have done well, and now I, too, have something for you. Come.
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
Yes.
Shall we unpack it?
Otto! You and one of those other fellows! Come help Professor Darcey.
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
Have you got it? Is it completed?
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
Yep. Everything settled.
Yes....
What was her name?  The one I met.
What was her name?
-- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?   What did your life mean?  Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love?
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
Two: what if I didn't miss?
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
Where is she?
Well, I got to see her.
Is Rose here?
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
I know, Mother.
They're filthy, Mother.
Of course not!
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
Rose is madly in love with Daddy...
I do, too!
Yeah, I know.
I do, too.
Neither do I.
I think you're right, it would be harder on her. But you'd better call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to need help to get home.
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist?
Mother... is Rose going to die?
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
You can stop it right now.
... okay... you made your point.
Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?
Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
You're not gonna see him again.
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
But... I love him.  I do...
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
I was going to tell him.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
I... I can explain...
Fair enough.
We'll take the CalTrust heist, but if it's no good, we will hunt you down, and Billy-Boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it.
Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
Come on, don't you screw with her, please!  You... you got to want this: armored car job.  CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
Careful she doesn't hit her head on the way.
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
Who cares?
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Am I supposed to take this information and sit up in the hills with a frickin' telescope?
Now you know what to watch for...
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
What and?  That's what I got.
And... ?
Okay, man, okay.  I'm with you.  I... I heard how the shit's arriving...  It's coming in a Lincoln.
You get nothing and like it.  And if we're not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.
Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
You think it's that good?
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
How much?
A little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you're chasing.  It's up here...  ... in the old curiosity shop.
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
Every person's got their own kinks, beef-cake.  What's wrong, Kittle?  You don't swing?
Incestuous.
Indivisible and inseparable.
Abe Lincoln...
What... ?
Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln.  A parade float.
You don't.  It's a gamble.  But, not even in Vegas are you gonna get close to this kind of cash.  This is <U>two million</U>, Archie.  It's not three houses, it's twelve.  It's dreams come true.
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
It's six o'clock.  Time's runaing out.  Decide.
I don't know.  Fuck off!
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.  All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
This is private property.  This is breaking and entering!
I don't know, okay?  All I know is Butch Cassidy's back in town.
I need the "when" and the "where."
It's bone dry out there.  Everybody's hurting.  The stuff floating around's been cut so many times it's like powdered sugar, but Zimnermann's gonna fix it.
Alright!  Alright... put me down...
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
This scag is enough to keep every junkie from here to the Mexican border high as a kite for the next two years.  You think we're gonna let Zimmermann haul it onto <U>our</U> streets on the Fourth-of-fucking-July!?
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
Again.
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
Word is, while the vice cops on the East Coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into New York City.  And, right now it's making a cross-country journey to Hollywood, U.S.A.
Oh, you fuckers!  You fucking fuckers!  What?  What do you want?
Really?  Is that a fact... ?
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
Kittle...
Happy Independence Day.
I'm not taking a cigarette break, jackass, just give me one!
Gimmie a butt.
How you doing back there?
We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.
Same day as before.  I think.
They shot us all, kid.
What about him?
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?
Entertainers don't count.
Name one.
The booze.
When you planning to cut back on that?
Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
Welcome to Beverly Hills. Wife-swapping Capital of the World.
Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
Clench your teeth.
Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Could be worse.  I don't know how, but I'm sure it could.
Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.
It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.
"A.D."
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!
Stop blaming yourself.
You big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren't for me, you'd still be sitting in the file room where I found you.  And you... Nena... you've still got needle scars from where I pulled you out of.  You of all people...
What of it?  Haven't we waited forever... ?  Haven't we, honey?  Haven't we waited long enough to get this scumbag?
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.
I can not even begin to imagine how much that must have hurt.
Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared.
Relax.
Move it!
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.
Get ready.
I can work this.
We'll share.
Sons of bitches!
What do you want me to do about it?
Save it.  Just go.
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
What, am I supposed to read it while I drive?  Keep a grip on it, alright?
She's right.  If you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you "daddy."
What'd I say?
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
How's your precious little school-marm today?
We've got the tape to prove it.
There probably is.
Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
Nope.
No.
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
Don't talk like that.  There's plenty of women around for jerks like you.
Whoa, whoa... it's gonna be alright.
Speak for yourself.
Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.
Okay.  It doesn't smell as bad in here as I remember it smelling.
You live like a pig.
Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!
Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.
We have to find Kittle.
Follow me.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
Smooth move, hot-shot.
It's go time, Billy-B.
Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
No, but it should.
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
Oh... okay.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
Birth control's important.
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
It's not gonna happen.
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
Maybe.
You going rogue on me?
Our resignations.
I'm here.  That's all that counts. Watch... you'll enjoy this... it's like magic...
Where have you been?
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?
Not like this.  Are you even listening?
There'll be other chances.
Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
Yes, sir.
Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
He went to pick up lunch.
We've been chasing this deal six months, and now you're gonna chuck it out the window?
Can't I?
You can't be serious.
It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!
What?
Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.
I... I think I can... clarify...
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
Well, sir...
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
You think you accomplished something... like you're heroes? Fuck you!   This is meaningless! You'll never win!  You know, as soon as I'm gone... someone's going to take my place.
It's our job.
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.
Thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.
Murderer?  Really?
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
Couldn't have said it better myself.
Thank you for sharing that charming image.
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
Good.  Thought I was imagining them.
Yeah.
You see that?
Keep 'em busy.
The gang's all here!
Well, that's what I heard, and that's what I choose to believe.
I don't think so.
When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
Do tell.
Know what I love about dynamite?
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
Why the beach?
Billy!  Billy!
You John-Wilkes-Booth-ed him.
Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out soon enough.
Think Zimmermann's watching?
Beholden to none.
No more counting the big money for someone else.
There's not even enough places to stash it in a car.
This much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. It's got to be smuggled.
I'm well aware of that.
We're screwed.
It's just a question of how long do we have to slap you silly till you spill the beans.
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
You suck at lying, Archie.
Seatbelts fastened, please.
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?
What the hell's his problem?
Who is that... ?
Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.
Your wish is my command.
Get his attention.
Maybe it's enough.
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
Come again... ?
A.D. is a C.P.A.
How'd we do?
Just got here.
Been waiting long?
Sounds good.
Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together?  Find out who "A.D." is.  I got a quick errand to run.
Gimmie a minute.
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
Chalk up another victory for Billy-Boy's one man war on crime.
Dead.
You get him?
Out here.  On your knees.
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
All for one...
Let's get this thing done.
Whatever goes bang.
Any preferences?
Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
You need a doctor.
Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that's how I wanna keep 'em. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I know it is, even if you don't.
That's not true.
I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
I can't believe I'm hearing this,
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
What... ?  Not you too?
Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
You put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...
I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
Get closer!  Don't lose him!
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
Oh yeah?
Can't be worse than you.
You think this is so easy?
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
No you're not.
I'm gonna get beside him.
Let's hope.
If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.
Shit.  You're right.
Hold your horses, sweetpea.  We need Butch Cassidy alive, remember?
Don't crowd him.
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
Slow down.
We got him.
Absolutely.
Alright?
All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
You know what I mean.
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
You know... you could say thank you.
Yeah... great.
Let me see that...  Not bad.
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?  Some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.
Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
Arriving tonight
You are such a disappointment, Benny.
Pure horse.
Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Well, let me tell you how it is...
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
They're... around.
Where's your pet gorilla and the female Uncle Tom?
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
This shit was Ming.
So are you, Pop-Sweet.  That's why...
It's one of a kind.
You always did have style.
We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
All right. Stand by.
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
You cannot escape your destiny.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
Yoda will always be with you.
Jabba's palace.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
His lightsaber.
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
They are clear, my Master.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
I have felt him, my Master.
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
I told you to remain on the command ship.
Yes, my Master.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
What is thy bidding, my Master?
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
As you wish.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
Yes, my Master.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
Yes.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
Hold me.
I...
I don't know.
Shall we try and go around?
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
Hey, are you awake?
That's all any of us can see.
I gotta get you out of here.
Someone who loves you.
Good luck.
All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
Lower it!
Han! Chewie?
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
Oh, Artoo, hurry!
We're coming!
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
Here we go again.
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
We shall double our efforts.
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
There it is!
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
Here goes nothing.
I'm going in.
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
Good shot, Red Two.
Red Leader standing by.
All wings report in.
Oh, no.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Quiet.
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
What's he saying?
Your Royal Highness.
Oh!
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
Ugh!
But, why must you confront him?
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
Your father?
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
Over there! Two more of them!
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
There is no conflict.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
If that is your destiny.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
So, you have accepted the truth.
The Emperor has been expecting you.
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
Told you, did he?
Your father he is.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
Disintegrated?
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
How many languages do you speak?
Oh. Well, yes.
Yes or no will do.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
Janet
Janet.
Janet.
Janet.
Yes.
You know this earth - this person.
You're wet.
Hello.
You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
You're OK by me.
A decision had to be made.
You did right.
Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
Great Heavens, that's a laser.

Oh my, my,

The delivery boy.
The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
I think you had better both come inside.
And our World will do the Time Warp again.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
Creature of the night.
Creature of the night.
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.
Fouls.
...It's very American.
Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
Where're you off to now?
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
How was the flight, Champ?
Kiss my ass.
I don't like ya face.
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
Hear she's retarded.
...Of the truck that run over your face.
Did ya get the license number?
We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
Hey, give Rocky a dime.
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
That's ten bucks.
Here -- Three minutes.
Cost ya a buck.
Six!
Seven minutes!
Nine minutes!
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
Few minutes?
This a con?
Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'.
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
No way -- but the brilliant ability of the Champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- Creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks Rocky. Creed on the offensive -- Balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart... that hurt.
There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.
Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
Creed is down!!!
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.
I agree.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
I only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
Yo' yellow, old man.
Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
I'm happenin'! This pig is takin' my shot -- I iz a contender. He's nothin'.
I say ya nothin'!
Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
You have my food in ya hand.
That's it.
That's it, I'm broke.
Bob.
Please, I need my hands to work -- Christ, don't bust my thumbs.
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
Not spar, I'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting Creed for the championship.
Did you hear what I said?
Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
What?
I'm sure you are.
Excuse me.
Rocky, would you be interested in --
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
Mr. Balboa --
Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat.
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.
It ain't your locker no more.
We're not responsible for animals left over thirty days -- We board it ain't a animal shelter, Y'know... Adrian, I want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess.
Bullmastiff.
Ain't had time to check 'em.
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
Do you feel you have a chance?
We can cut that out later. Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.
How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout?
So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
So what's your next move, Valiant?
No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
You serve martinis, doncha?
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
Somebody took it from him.  That's what this whole thing's about.
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
You don't believe that.  I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!
What's this, Roger?
Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
Does it hurt?
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
What the hell is that?
That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
Wait here...
They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
Now what?
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
Uh? Uh?
No better?
If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.
Quarrel sir! no, sir.
[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
Then I'll leave thee.
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Have patience!
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.
Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
He shall be endured
I'll not endure him.
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
'Tis he.
Young Romeo is it?
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
Hold Daughter!
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
Romeo, come forth.
Welcome.
O, mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give, nor aught so good, but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
Goodnight.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
Here comes your father, tell him so yourself.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
She'll not come down tonight.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
I am for you.
What wouldst thou have with me?
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one of you?
As my American friend Larry would say: are you fucking deaf?  It's under your seat.
What?
It's under your seat.
To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything...
Why did you do that?
You know it is.
Do you really think so?
This is important.
Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
Do you have it?
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
What is?
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
How do we know that?
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
So what's the deal?
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
Who the fuck are you?
Shut up!
Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.
Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.
There's a problem...
Ready when you are...
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
In this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.
I'd stake my reputation.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
It's quite satifactory.
These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
Who are you?  IRA?
I think not.  After you...
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
You first, Edvard.
Do you have the material?
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
We'll double your price.
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
Yes, Gregor, they sent me.
In here...
Of course.
If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.
There's been a slight problem.
He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
Bad company...
Not so fast.  Who's that?
You'll die if you leave here.
We'll die if we stay here!
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
And more importantly --
Enough!
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
Sit, sit...  Would you like one?
I think not.  I have, of course, taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens.  Unless, of course, I deactivate it before it goes off.
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
But you hate each other!
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
I swear, it has to come here!  It has to...
A post office box.
I sent it to myself in Paris.
I swear...
I don't have it with me...
Now that is an interesting proposition.
Whoever hired us.
What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
So what do we do?
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
Gregor, is that you?
It's done.
Is it done?
I do, I do...
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
Really?
Nobody's going to do that!
Don't cross me...
What are you doing?
What's that?
There is one other thing...
Then I guess we're set.
That's it.
A means to an end, is that it?
I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.
Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides.  Your orders might be different from mine.
How so?
If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
And you respect him.
He's tough, your American friend.
Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
You seem one to me.
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
Call it a reckoning of character.
Not a word.  But no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do.  And so I place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me.  You work for some government agency and you carry a gun, and in my world, that makes you a cop.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
But first you have something to take care of?
You should really let a doctor look at that.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
Why don't you go do better, then...
Is that right?
Not for long.
Gets the job done.
Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
I don't think so.
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
Not in mine.
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
Is that right?
You should learn a little patience.
Where is this broad?
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
Eat shit and die slowly...
I ride with fat-boy...
Who you calling dumb, dickless?
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
You should watch what you eat.
Everybody.
Who's they?
They call me Swede.
I got a surprise for you, blondie...
What a surprise...
What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
Gonna be tough.
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
You sure?
It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
The Russian would be easier.
All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
I might know where you could get a copy.
Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
Why don't we step into my office...
Doing well.  This is?
My man, how you doing?
It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
Denning was wearing a bug.
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.
Yes.  Wife and a kid.  Don't blame yourself, Deputy.  You did all you could.  You have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks.
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
Because someone may have gotten away.
Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
Hello.
Thanks for your time.
A week ago, at most.
Be more specific.  A month, a week...
Could it have been this?
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
What did he buy?
Yeah, I've seen him.
First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
Am I speaking English here?  How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
What?
How about you give us what you have and leave.
And what's that?
I have a better plan.
What?
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?
You said that, I didn't.
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?
Sounds like you don't trust me.
Yeah.
Test the product?
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Sheriff Hogan --
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
We don't know.  Whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.
Mm-hmm...
Don't you have to be here?
Oh that was Agent Wallace.  We're going to check into something.
Because they don't want anyone to hear what's on it, obviously.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Uh, no...
We appreciate that.
Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Yeah.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
Sure.
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
C?
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
No, I can't say that I have.
Have I seen her?
Hmmm...
We are having a sale on some items over here --
Anything...specific?
Anything I can help you with?
Hello.
Not getting an answer?  For Christ's sake!  Call 911!  Let's get it locked down here!
I'm not getting an answer.
This isn't right...
What do you think?  Heart attack?
Yeah.
We're going to find out.
You think he skipped town?
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
We're doing a check on the manufacturers'	serial number, see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch.  What's your take on these local boys?  Are they providing any answers?
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
So someone did get away.
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
So...what's the good news?
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
Not in the trunk.
There was more than that.
But nowhere near three million dollars worth.  I would say maybe twenty thousand.
Money.
Anything in it?
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
Give me the bad news.
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong Kong right now?
Winner!  Four, winner!
Two-hundred thousand!
Winner six!
No, sir.
No, I just assumed...
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the help.
Wait.
The band has been playing over an hour.
Invitation, please.
I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.
One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
Is this about the funny money?
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
I got my sources.
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
I don't think so...
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
I'm busy at the moment.
Oh yes, she's very nice.
You pick any girl for you and your friend.
You get massage from Chinese girl before?
You bring American money?
Oh, you American?
You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
I still have my lunch money from third grade.
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.
Master Ching taught me.
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...
Are you okay, Lee?
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
I don't think it's over.  There are casinos all over this country.  Let me make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make the same mistake he did.
You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
It's a massage parlor downtown.  "Heaven on Earth."  You will find your answers there.
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
No.  Your father.  Your father and Ricky Tan were my favorite students... and for such awful things to happen as they did --
He was the best I ever trained, you know.
Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee.
That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
Who the hell is that?
No.  He will report to me.  Do we understand each other?
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
This is still Hong Kong.
Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us.
The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made.  If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter.
Shut up!
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
What is your name?
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
They asked for the best street man I had.
I got a call from the F.B.I.  The daughter of the Chinese Ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help. You're it.
Good job.
That's probably the only reason Johnson's still alive.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
He was just doing his job.
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
This is pathetic.
Carter.
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
You sonuvabitch.
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
What are you talking about?
Do it!
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
What are you talking about?
Nobody touches me.
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
Or somethin'.
Shut up!
I want to speak with my daughter!
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
Hello.
Please, you must understand, what happened today was not --
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
Yes.
Can I speak with her?
She's fine.
My daughter.
Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
Yes.
Ambassador Han.
Hello.
Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
I do.
You have what I asked for?
Yes.
Griffin?  Where are you.
It's Griffin.
Yes.
Han?
Hello.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
I am so sorry about your men.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
He is already on the plane.  I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
He is very good.
I would like one of my people to help.
I will not have friends in America.
After I left?
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
Let me take you back inside, okay?
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.
Ike just came by to check out the team.
Maintain eye contact.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
You look awful.
What do you expect me to say to this?
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
See you at the wedding.
I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
God bless you, Maggie.
It happens to be how I feel.
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
Only respectful things.  What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
I'll get the dress.
We'll rub.
We do it to our dog.
And in a "V".
That's it.  Back to obedience school.
Rub your ears.
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
"Nothing but net."
"Sink the putt."
Bob's in a hurry.
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.
Where do you think she's going?
I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.
No.  No, you didn't.
Fisher, let him talk.
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
I already made an appointment for later today.
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
Journalism lesson number one.  If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
-- It's for you, Ike.
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
Poor Ike.
Look, he's running after her.
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
Unbelievable, she got to you.
And you defending her?
Why do YOU think she ran?
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.
Tootaloo.
Oh, I will.
I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
Oh, come on.  You're practically family.
You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.
Your two cinnamon rolls.
-- The luau for Maggie.
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
Like her mother.
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
A harmless joke.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
What?
I'm really rooting for this one.
I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
Good boy, Port Hole.
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
Maybe she hasn't read the paper...
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
You tell Maggie.
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
So you're angry.  Big deal.
What am I going to do with a microwave?
That's good.
Nope.
Nope.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
It sounds nice.
He's got a houseboat.
You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
A sense of humor.
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
Okay.
Go home for the weekend.
Maybe you should see a shrink.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
Any time.
Yes, I did.
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
What?
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Grace heard it.
Which means --
Right, right.
It is not --
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
No.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
You'll like it.
You'll see.
You'll find out.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
When's the latest time you were out there?
Everywhere.  You can't even turn on the news without hearing about how some babe thought some guy's butt was cute.  Who the first babe to say this was I don't know, but it caught on.
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda ... She's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --
Hey, my plate is full.
I'd rather die than eat on an airplane.  I'm telling them you're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and they won't make you be carried around by a stewardess and everything.
Do you want a fruit plate?
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
You have to go to her, Jonah. You have to find her.
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
Your only hope.
It's Y. O. H.
Write her.
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
Well...
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
What about it?
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.
Well, here's the number.  If you ever find yourself Sleepless, give us a call.  We also... do babysitting.
We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by.
You must be Jonah.
Hi.  Sam?
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
"An Affair To Remember." Did you ever see it? Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.  Before that it was called "Love Affair With Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer."
It's a little derivative.
You're kidding --
How's Jonah taking it?
You saw her in the airport and then here?
He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
I'm sorry --
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
I read the same article...
He's good at it.
Absolutely.  Right.
Is he there?
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
Oh.
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
I thought you were never going to call me.
You look good yourself.
Hi.
There's nothing stopping you.
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
That's none of their affair.
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
No thanks.
You're welcome to one.
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
I don't make policy.
Got any more ideas?
No, just the ring leaders. The fire-eaters. And the ones with big families ...  Barton -- where's that boy?
You want 'em all arrested?
You haven't tried locking them up!
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
Well?
Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.
Whose side are you on anyway?
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
Well, those new fellows you hired from out of town -- we brought 'em up here in a truck this morning, but they took one look at that picket line and turned tail.
How's it going?
Mornin'.
You know ...  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
The woman question?
It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.
Yeah.
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
It never ends.
How goes it?
You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
No, no, it's the president of the company himself -- come all the way out here to make Jenkins general manager. So why you acting so mean?
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
I say we gotta take action. Now.
Take a drink. Calm down!
You're a liar, Pancho. A no-good, dirty ...
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
An American.
Who? A scab?
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
So much the better.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Why are they singing, Mama?
Mama, can I put the candles ...
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
Are you sick, Mama?
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
This means they've given up trying to break the picket line.  Now we can all fight together -- all of us.
This is what we've been waiting for.
Will you be still?
Shut up, you're talking crazy.
You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
Like what?
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
Why not? I'm not needed here.
No.
Sun up.
Hunting.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
Be still ...
You weren't waiting for me.
A meeting?
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
Four nights. How did you sleep?
How do you feel?
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
You all right?
Can be what?
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
No.
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
Over my dead body.
Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win...  ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
They say I am no good to you.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
A fighter, huh?
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
What's the matter?
I did forget. Lus told me.
Antonio paid for it.
I'm a fool.
Aaah, what's the use?
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
Now don't start talking against the union again.
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
The safety of the men -- that's more important! Five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up. You're a woman, you don't know what it's like up there.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
Do you think I like living this way? What do you want of me?!
Forget it.
This water's cold again.
Got to talk to the brothers.
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
We can't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such.
Or why don't you just put a sign outside? "No dogs or women allowed!"
But honey ...
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
You know I don't think that.
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
Go on. Spill it.
Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too, but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it!
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
Are we talking to a union spokesman?
It's possible. Just negotiate.
Well, if that's possible ...
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
No ...
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
No. New York.
You mean Delaware?
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
You should have helped her without being asked.
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
You've got to help around the house!
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
The what!
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
Where's your mama?
Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
Lus! Come down here!
It's Mama's Saint's Day.
Forgot what?
I thought maybe you forgot...
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
My kids don't have enough to eat!
T! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
Ramn -- listen my kids ...
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
Ramn ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
Ramn ... listen for the love of God ...
Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
What attitude?
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
I was talking to my wife.
No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.
You mind?
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
Good. I fucking hate Australians.
No.
Are you Australian?
That's it?
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ...
What?
What can I do for you?
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
The spiders.
Shhh.
What is it?
Did you see his hair color?
How about in the house?
Not even a guess?
I ain't a idiot, asshole.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules.
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes.
First rate, ain't it?
You like that?
What?
Hey, you did the right thing. You wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. They have eaten your ass alive.
How you holding up?
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.
Who is it?
Understand what?
You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose.  Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?
By not disgracing her memory!
That was my idea.
Please ... don't do this ...
Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can we talk about this?
Danny?
I thought you'd be happy.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
We got the 411 on your good old boy.
I'm afraid so, Danny.
That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
That's because he doesn't have one.
You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
Bullshit. He's a liar.
No. You just handed us a new one.  We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.  What's the mandatory on that, Al?
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
You've got no choice.
Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
What're your taking down?
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
This chink have a name?
You think this is funny motherfucker?
Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
Cut the shit, Flynne.
Question is, what are you doing here?
Soon. I promise.  We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear.  In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people.
I was getting to it.
Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money.
Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
It's not my place.
Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
Danny, I'm touched.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
No last name?
What?
You got a name?
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
You go, boy.
My sentiments exactly.
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
Just no pleasing you, is there?
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
What do you mean?
Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
There's no motels around here.
Really?
You, madam, are a heartless wench.
Again, I thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Where's Bubba?
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
We're in business.
Now that's scary!
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
Don't worry about it.
Better than drugs.
Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday.
Good luck, John.
Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.
Spit it out, Captain.
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
Where are your men now?
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
Casualties?
Resistance?
Report.
...alright, let me know when.
Senator's son?
That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
Sorry, sir.  Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen.  How come you guys aren't going?
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
And Sarge?
Yeah?
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside.
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
Yes, sir.
I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
I'd like to go, sir.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...
We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.
Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty- two flat.
How fast?
Who knows?  It worked.
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
Because he's guilty.
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...
And your former wife.
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
So you refuse to answer my questions?
Understanding the following rights...
You're sure?
Okay, thanks.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
Thanks, I like yours too.
Excellent.
Good for her.
For going to school?
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together?
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
He's a mess!
I still am.
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
Gee, it's easy.
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
Why do you eat that stuff?  There's no food in your food.  Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.
I hope you understand.
I'm sorry. Sam had to do a new crown, we had [?], and Jason had a sore throat.  Your big graduation, and no one was there.
Lloyd?
I dream about it.
I've forgotten what I was going to say... okay, okay, I remember. Let him do what he wants.
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You're an inspiration Lloyd; you should go on the seven hundred club or something.
Lloyd, it's us.
I told him to be himself.
Meaning?
I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
Come on, it's graduation.
Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.
What is wrong with this girl?
Why?
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
Alright.
I'll put this past my boss
Confirm this with my office and my client.
I can put that together.
He'd like to start serving immediately.
And I want to turn the home over to the state.
I can accept that.
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
I can't give you that.  This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years.  He's been getting it from every end.  I'd love to hear his story.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Visit her at the home.
Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Alright.
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
You're freaking out here man.
Man, you're bringing me down!
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
It's your castle, man.
Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
PAIN!
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
YEAH!
Yeah.
Dude, I can't do it!
Your car?
Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes?  They're going to be valuable some day.
So what's up?
Hang tough, Lloyd.
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
We'll just make an appointment for you at Seattle Junior College.
Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you.  That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing.  You have to decide on a career.
Lloyd.
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
I don't really know where we are.
Ooop, excuse me.
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
Oh boy.
Certainly.
Diane, everybody loves that you showed up.
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
Wow, man.  Well.  Listen man, I need you to be the keymaster.
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
Later for you, Luke.
We're full on bonded.
I love you man.
Give me my firebird keys!
I love you man
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
Now you're back.
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
Oskar - my friend Lena.
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
Klaus Tauber.
Sir, the list is correct.
He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
Should I stay?
Should I stay?
I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
Luck.
It's not a charade, all this?
I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
Oskar, please -
In Breslau.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
What do I got for you?
You want to stay on it?  What do you got for me?
Of course I'm on it.
Hey, Poldek, how's it going?  You know about the list?  You're on it.
Yeah, I can.
Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
Look it up.
This is not my problem.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
So I'm responsible for the weather?
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
You asked for shoe polish.
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
What's that?
You're a good man.
God bless you, sir.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
What are you doing?
Good.  How's it going?
What's wrong with it?
She's good.
Yeah.
How many?
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
Like this?
Pistols?
We're losing the war, aren't we.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
Thank you.
How do you do?
Oskar, good of you to come.
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
That'd be fine.
What others?
I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
He's stealing from you, Oskar.
There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
No.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
We're aware of that.
We know that, son.
On national television.
I would say we are now officially baffled.
Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
You're sure about this two person thing?
They've broken their pattern.
He's broken his pattern.
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
Take the neighborhood.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
Have you checked the...
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
I'm losing you.
Hang up...call...
What? I can't hear you...
Don't do that. Hang up...call...
That's smart.
Outside.
I can't believe you're alone in that house.
Stop it...
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Where?
I heard a noise.
What is it?
Shit.
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
Don't. Think Bailey.
I won't.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week...
thought he was doing AA.
No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
Don't forget to set the alarm.
WHAAAATT?
No, it's me.
Hello? Ted?
I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?
I'm inquisitive.
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
Why would you wanna do that?
What if I said goodbye?
What if I said you?
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
That's too bad.
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
Why aren't you there?
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
Where is everybody?
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
That's okay.
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
Someone who wants to talk to you.
Cici. Who's this?
Who is this?
Yes.
I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room.
Just some asshole trying to scare me.
I had to change. Did anyone call?
I thought you were going to the mixer?
I live here.
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
Not until youre dead.
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
Its perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. Im the victim.
You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
It helped me realize one thing.
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
You could start with an apology.
Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
Can we talk?
Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.
You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
You freakin?
No way.
Where's Sid?
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
I could use some therapy.
What's your subject?
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
Watch your back.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
It's what you want from me.
Stay away from the cop.
I'm everywhere.
You're pretty when you're angry.
What if your life depended on it?
That's not the way we play the game.
I'll give you one guess.
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
Where is your attacker?
Are you in danger now?
But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
"And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will always love you."
"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...
I got a surprise for you.
Is Sid in therapy?
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
I have to watch rehearsal.
Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight.
The young girl is slashed again.
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house." etc.
A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room.
It's documented. Most serial killers are attractive--slightly off white males in their twenties.
Easy black boy.
And white.
No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. MICKEY Watch out, Derek.
Her old boyfriend?
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
I've been waiting for you, baby.
I counted four.
How many guys they have on you?
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
I just love being a sister.
..harmonica style is okay.
..it's really about family and tradition...
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
We've set you each at a five dollar quota.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
..this week's TKE kegger...
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
Do you want to die?
Closer than you think.
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
What's your favorite scary movie?
What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
But she's standing right next to you.
She's not here right now.
Gale?
Hello?
Sandra started without us. We can stay. He kisses her again, then breaks away.
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
I get scared really easy, okay.
Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?
You are so not funny.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
You ass.
I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
Shush.
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
Now.
But...
Take it off.
We got free tickets.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
I hate scary movies.
What was that?
Where you going?
What are you talking about?
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
I gotta coupla of those buttons myself.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
No, the other one. The one who played his wife.
Melinda McGraw?
There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
Reaction to what?
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
Where are you?
Yeah.
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
What?!
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
What kind of a game?
Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
What do you mean?
Thanks.
Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
Asshole, Can't talk.
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
Well what number are you trying to reach?
Who is this?
Jesus.  Hello?
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
Well you'll find neither. Rina Reynolds, however, You will.
I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
Nope.
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
Can I help you?
Alright, calm down. I'm going to radio in for backup right now.
Jesus Gale what happened?
Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?
Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a third killer.  Sidney Might know something
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried.
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
And who would that be?
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
There's more.
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
Catch him, or kill him.
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
What did you know about your mother?
Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
To me Hollywood is about death.
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
You mean like, movie trilogies?
Are you sure?
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
Sid, get in my car. You're coming back to the station with me where it's safe.
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
What?  When?
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
What Rielly?
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?
When we did the first 'Stab" I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press?
What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
I remember her!  She was a bit player in a couple of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?
What's your point?
Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
Sure.
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
Honestly, my life.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
Yeah.
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Who?
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
You mean what's left of us.  Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel.
Really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role in Roman Polanski's latest picture. Huh, what a coincide I was picked up by Roman Bridger. Well, not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck, because of your big mouth I'm here, drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer Jollie and yourself!  Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should Have a look at your break line. That your car over there?
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
My movie.
What?  What movie?
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
It is in my script.
Roman that's not the line.
It's Sarah.
I'm hanging up right now.
But you know my favorite name?
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
Who's this?
Who's this?
Hello.
Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
Huh, fine.
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
You're not happy with your part.
What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your   music video awards.
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
No.
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
It's mother, Sidney, now be a good girl and turn on the news. DO IT!
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
No I need to call you. Just you.
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Hello?
Not my daughter... not my...
Casey! Casey!
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
Where is she?
The phone's dead.
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
Call the police.
Where is she?
Casey? Casey?
What is it? Where's Casey?
Jesus...
I told you to send it back.
That fish smelled strong.
About thirty seconds.
The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.
What's the plan?
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
You want to go live?
What? What?
Ricki Lake.
Where do you get this shit?
And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
You're evil.
Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.
Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
And why would she do that?
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
Why would she lie about it?
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
Sleep tight, sweetie.
...so call if you need me.
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
I heard screaming.
Are you okay?
He had a gun.  He had a gun... and he made it happen.  He made me do it!  He made me put that... that thing on.  Oh, Christ!  He made me wear it... and... and he told me to fuck her.  He had the gun in my mouth.
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
What?  What?
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
Okay...
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.
I'm... I'm just delivering a package.
What the hell's going on?
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
Why is this painting hanging upside-down?
This painting...
I can't do this now... please.
I don't see anything.
I don't know why... why now?
I... I don't understand.
I don't know.
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
Crime of passion.
When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together.  She was crying too hard to say anything.
Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.
Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...
You're my brother...You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to...Ain't that so, Martha?
They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...
But Mose Harper said...
How's California?
I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't you, ma?
What, Ben?
It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...
It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre!  Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back.
That's enough...Go on inside and help Lucy set the table...You, too, Deborah!
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
It was, I tell you!
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
Let's get along...
Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
I ain't wearing no gun.
AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
Yes sir...
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
Dunno...Seems so.
No sir...pleasure.
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
Yes, sir...
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
If there's anything I can do, sir...
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
Sir?
Captain Clayton...Captain!
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
Yes sir...We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar...
My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir. The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of Rangers in the field, fully armed and...
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
These are my people...  Unnt-meah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
Unnt-meah!
Martin! Ride me as far as the well!
Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
Ay-eh...They was here...
Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.
In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
You got it with you?
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
I beg your pardon?
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
Was your niece about their age?
You've seen her!...She's alive?
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
Why it's just a snip of calico...
Don't go blamin' yourself...
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
They never find that girl.
Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
From the beginning...
Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
We got two around that age...
I don't know all about what happened back then.  But it always stood between me and my husband.
That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in.
You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
You know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life.  But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies.
I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.
Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
Does this dog here belong to you?
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
What?
Mrs. Straub!
A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
Hammer?
Yes, something was...
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew...
Well, it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it.
We should leave the past alone.
You didn't tell her!
Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
Just call me Elisabeth.
Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?
Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?
I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
Very funny.
Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
Well, look here!
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
The title won't do.
It's good.
The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
WillWhere is Mercutio?
And the title of this piece?
Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a child.
Thank you, my lady!
Writer, is he?
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
I had the Christopher Marlowe in my boat once.
Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
I know your face. Are you an actor?
Right you are, governor!
Treachery!
You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
Never!
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
Twenty pounds on delivery
Wait!  Will you desist!
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
Tomorrow.
You have the money?
You have the last act?
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
What do you want, Kit?
We will all be put in the clink.
No Juliet?!
Ask him.
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
Ned is wrong for it.
You're a liar.
How much?
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
The title?
What is the chief part?
Are you writing?
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
So now you are free to love
No, your marriage bed.
And your relations?
A woman of property?
No, no. You have a wife, children
How long has it been?
Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
Most interesting.
Interesting.
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
And yet you tell me you lie with women?
A different one you haven't written?
I thought your play was for Burbage.
His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
The daughter of his enemy.
Ethel.
Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of love.
What is the story?
And yours?
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
Burbage says you have a play.
How goes it, Will?
"Out of her favour where I am in love."
"Of love?"
"Out."
"Not having that which, having, makes them short."
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
"Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
"But new struck nine."
"Is the day so young?"
"Good morrow, cousin."
God bless you!
Be good to her, my lord!
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
Your mother, and your father
Verona again.
As a nurse.
Like Valentine and Silvia?
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
Be still.
When the Queen commands it.
I liked the dog, for laughs.
But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
Above Lord Wessex?
And--?
They are not acted for you, they are acted for me.
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
What do you love so much?
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
Stand up straight, girl.
Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
There was a wager, I rememberas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
By and by I come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. A thousand times good night!"
"Madam!"
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
"Madam!"
"All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
"Go ask his name--If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed."
"I know not."
Will!
Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart.
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
"Parting is such sweet sorrow"
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
Master Shakespeare
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
I am, Master Shakespeare.
"The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine."
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here.
I would not for the world!
"She speaks.
"Ay me."
"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.
"Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly urg'd. Give me my sin again."
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
"Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
"Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
Yes, I know. But he was always hanging around the house.
I have, Master Shakespeare.
What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.
Like you, I found him not at home!
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!
But what of Lord Wessex?
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
What of her bosom?
She sings too?
And her voice? Like lark song?
And her lips?
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
I  Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Does she say so?
It is only ours you can know.
If you love her, you must do what she asks.
I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
I . . .
My hat?
Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.
Don't know what?
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
Well?
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
What?
Well, yes.
Yes.
Oh, yes, it's great.
Yes.
Yes, thanks.
That's right.
Which is why I'm trusting you with this account.
You get the job done.
And that's why I think you fit in here.
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
But they sneer, don't they?
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
In this firm.
Here.
What do we do here, David?
That's what I thought.
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
That one, last week.
That guy, the one that died.
What happened to that guy?
Well, it's up to you. Seven six five. How will you be paying?
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.
Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?
October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five.
Is it real?
You can tell by the intonation.
Offering it for debate.
Both, sir.
What're you talking about, George?
Then what's the problem?
Don't you like her?
I thought you were in a good mood.
No.
I don't know, I think...
Don't you think there's too much gold?
Anyway, you remember Harold?
Chicken salad.
You're in a good mood today, George.
Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?
I mean credit references, Mr. Roundy.
Pardon me?
What sort of references do you have?
It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it.
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
You do know what money's like these days.
And you need money?
So you want to go in business for yourself?
I went to school with her husband.
Wonderful woman.
How is she?
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
You are today.
You do it.
What!
You're late, George.
Don't use that tone of voice with me... never mind, I'll take Gordon.
You promised you'd do the show.
Yes, Buffums.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
George!
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
Wanda...
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
She touched it! Then she played in it and got it all into something else. Now I don't know what it is!
-- Right after I sprayed her?
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
-- took a bus.
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
-- you know better...
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
Otis is dead.
That boy always does great. He's a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called Kwang Due?
-- Oh my yes.
But then again you ask for it -- you just like my Otis -- can't keep his hands outta ladies' hair either.
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
What with?
Yeah!
Not yet.
-- yes, George.
Jackie Shawn.
Okay!
Call me!
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
Hi, George.
I have to see you.
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
But Mr. Norman said --
No?
-- A wash and set.

Come on by.
Awww --

All right, who're you with? Jill?

What took you so long?

I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
No you won't.
I'm coming over.
You're home.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
And?
A soap?
Yes.
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
Sid.
Well maybe I can get you something.
See you later.
I'll call you.
Oh yeah?
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
Jackie, what're you doing?
Thanks for coming by.
We'll let you know tomorrow.
John...
Do you have something against traveling?
Are you married?
Do you have children?
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.
Three weeks.
You seem disappointed.
Nothing.  There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out!  You understand, stay out!
No I ain't.
Room 237?
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
Try to think what it was.
Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Do they know he tell you things?
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
How does he tell you things?
Is Tony the one that tells you things?
Who's Tony?
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Why don't you want to talk about it?
Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
Now this is where we keep all of out meat.  You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers.  You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb.  Do you like lamb, Doc?
Yes, I'd like you to.
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
Where does he go?
Why not?
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Oh,
Is Tony one of your animals?
Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
How did he manage to do that?
What sort of injury did he have?
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
Thank you.
Yes.
Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
Sure.
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
It's okay, really.
Well how can I repay you?
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
Good evening.  Forest Service.
All right, sir.
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Good evening.  Forest Service.
No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just getting to the ice cream.
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
Sure.
Good.
Well I guess I probably heard you call him that.
I did?
Beg pardon?
Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice.
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
Yeah, this is it.  How do you like it, Danny?  Is it big enough for you?
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.  Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
Glad to meet you, Winifred.
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
What line of work are you in now?
Pleased to meet you.
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
Your money's no good here.
What'll it be, sir?
It's good to see you.
Good evening Mr. Torrance.
Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em!
I hope it's nothing serious.
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
Thank you for saying so.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
What'll it be?
Fine.
Eight thirty.
Fine.
How do you do?
The moon's not down yet...
Sure, Uncle Al.
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
Blue. This blue.
Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters?
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
Uncle Al-
You're a real booger, you know it?
Are you all right, Marty?
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
Will you?
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
Went shopping. Why?
Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.
Let me help you up.
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
What's the money for?
If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
Brady's a booger and so are you!
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
Rattling. Rustling.
I've been hearing noises in there.
There's something else scary.
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
For getting a divorce?
What's that?
You booger.
I will- be good, kids.
You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again.  Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
What about crack?  You a user?
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
SING!
SING!
SING! SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR!
SING!
Yes, Mary?
LET THY SPIRIT
LET THY SPIRIT
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
What you do?
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
How come?  Sister?
We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
That... thing.  That nun thing.  Take it off.
Okay, Christy -- strip.
What?
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
With love.
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
Yes, Betty?
Oh my!
What is it, Betty?
Oh-huh.
Yes, Betty?
Really.
Oh-huh.
Hail, Mary.
You won't even tell us?
Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
They open a window.
A hiding place.
I'm telling you!
A nun?
That she's a nun!  That chick you're looking for -- she's a nun!
We didn't tell you what?
But you didn't tell me!
We're the guys from Vegas.  You had Christy last night, but you let her get away.  It's upsetting.
Who are you guys?
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
You found him -- but we're not open yet.
We're looking for Mike.
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
Where is she?
I can't see anything in here!
Which one?
Which one!
Maybe pants.
Right.
It didn't work, Vince.
Yeah...
But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
Not... totally.
It's a bluff, Vince.
And if she runs?
Vince -- is she... okay?
She's praying.
What's she doing?
And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
A sweater.
For like, twelve zillion eternities?
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?
That's what I figured, too.
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
Neither did you!
You didn't shoot!
No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
She's gettin' away!
Yeah, right -- when I see it.
So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?
And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
I know.
St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
Where?
We both missed.
She's... she's a nun.
She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.
She's a nun, Vince.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
He came to me.  He promised great violence.  Said I should cast you out for my own protection.  I must speak honestly.  There is no reason to think he will not meet with success.
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
Hail, Constable.  How are you?
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
Many have.
This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this...
You must have missed your mark.
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
They spend two days in chains.
Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.
What the hell are you doing?
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
Certainly not.
Well... that might be... helpful.
Damn... damn... damn...
A fine idea.
Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.
Hmm?  See them?
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
Excellent.  Then, you are excused till morning.
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Very few, if any.
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
Have they nothing to fear presently?
Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
He drowned.  Anyone could see.
It's not something people speak of openly.  She did not remarry.
The Widow Windsor.
Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.
No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.
Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
And now Jonathan Masbath.
Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.
Yes... yes.  I think I will...
You cannot kill what is already dead.
I know you saw me.
Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
No.  She has gone out.
As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo.  Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.
Use caution.
Returning to the Western Woods?
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
Yes.  Here...
What did you say?
I didn't see none.
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
I can show exactly.
Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
Sit.
I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.
Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
You are from the Hollow?
This whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon.  But... I am not going to kill you.  Not me...
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled.  Things I wanted him to see.  But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me.  Baltus did not stay enough to see that.  He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.
He rides tonight.
Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
Doctor, he is awake.
She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is?  All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
No.
She has confessed.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
She is guilty.
She did not do it... please listen...
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
May I see my mother?
Go home.
I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.
Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
I can't remember.
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
Okay. You don't have to though.
About a half a mile I think it is.
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
Yeah.
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
Yeah.
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
Well, I guess it's all good.
Did you decide, sir?
Naw, we don't have biscuits.
Well, what did you want?
Can I help you?
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
Why? Hi, Karl.
They're from the Dollar Store. I'm not an idiot. Besides we have a garden full of flowers.
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
Me, too.
Yeah.
These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?
You walk fast, don't you?
I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.
I ain't got no boy.
I ain't got no boy.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
Let's just go, Marsha.
Yeah.
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
Why?
Thanks. I knew you'd understand.
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
Do me a favor, will you?
What about for you?
And what about for you?
What'll it be, Auggie?
I thought maybe he was pretending.
Does it hurt?
Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
Okay, Auggie, I got it. You don't have to yell.
Sure, Auggie, I got it.  The store's closed.  And when do I tell them it's open?
I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.
Huh?
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
What does that mean?
Thanks for the tip.
The refrigerator?
I think I'll take them.
And these?
And these?
And how much are these?
An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
Baby? And what baby is that?
Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
What do you want me to say?
Well what?
Yeah? Who is it?
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
They didn't have to do a thing, that's all I'm saying. The team was good, the best fucking team in baseball. But then they had to screw it up.  They traded their birthright for a mess of porridge.  A mess of porridge.
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
Management. Those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses.
Yeah? And why is that?
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
So what's the time?
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
Huh?
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living.
Everything is real in here, honey.  As real as the color of my hair.
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
You want another one of these, too?
Lettuce and tomato?
Fries?
How do you want that cooked?
Didn't say I was buyin' did I? What you want down?  Just bein' curious, is all.
$1200 an acre, that's what I paid Ole, won't take a dime less.  You got no choice on that.
Hid it from my mom.  Caught a mess a sea runs.  Damn thing's still in my closet.
Oh, yeh?
I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
...<u>might</u> do the same.  I have to warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm not screwed together like I used to be.
The battery's in, that's done with.  Besides, you'd do the same for m...
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
I don't know.
I'm a hemotologist, sir, I was asked only t...
None.
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
That's obvious.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
Carl Heine's type.
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son.
In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
They fished t'gether.  Went to school. Carl Junior treated him like a white person.  Like any friend.
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
You done your math right.
Is that your third question?
A thousand.
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know in <u>advance</u>?  That Carl loses two batteries.  Must happen once ever' 20 years or so.
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
Boat has two batteries.  Lose one you run off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his.
No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size.  It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does.
Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
Your father fought at Belleau Wood, it took him years to get over it.  Nightmares, tears, b...
They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...
You don't believe in God anymore.
Oh, in a heartbeat.
What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
More than eager.  He was out to make a point.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
Japanese stick-fighting.  They're trained as kids, y'know.  To kill with sticks.
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?'  And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?'
He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
Carl Heine came.
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
Oh, yeh.  He said someday he would get his land back.
I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.
Yes.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
I have told the truth.
I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.
Yes.  Initially.
Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion.  I didn't have a lawyer...
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks. Just take up space.
Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...
Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
I was checking the cables.
What for, Sheriff?
And what do you believe?
You think that <u>is</u> the truth.
You want me to say that.
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
And what's that?
I should show them an American?
Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
You wouldn't even see it move.
Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
You must think I like losing.
You mean, do I like to take the offensive?  Or hang back and wait.
What makes you think I play?
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
Absolutely not.  Probably one or two hours.  Four at the most.
Can I say something, here?
For the third time, yes.
For certain, no.
I already said that, b...
Sure, anything's poss...
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
The same.
Obviously.
Well...
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
That's all he said.
Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
I can't speak for him.
He had no reason to.
Carl never lied.
Not in those words.
I wouldn't say encouraged.
Whatever the latest jargon is.                                   MEKUM Much better, much higher.  For example, where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination.  It's <u>all</u> aggression.                                   SLOAN                          <u>Real</u> men!                                   CHURCH                          At ease, Lieutenant.                          What if they fought?     A sudden silence.     SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look.     Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up. MEKUM You mean up there?                                   CHURCH                                             Go ahead, Rube.  Tell Todd to take him. MEKUM No!     They all look at MEKUM.  Is this the chink in the armor?  The new soldiers can't fight?                                   CHURCH                    "No"? MEKUM Not fair.  No contest.  Send two more of your old ones up.     Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned.  They exchange a glance.                                   MEKUM Go ahead.
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?
Maybe we could run some tests.  Kind of a comparison, the old and the new...
Such as?
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Mmmmmm.  Weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying...
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
Improved...how?
Never mind leaving your door open - I got a passkey.
It's from Satchel Mouth at Table Seven.  This is from me to you, doll.
Which of you dolls is Daphne?
That's the way I like 'em - big and sassy.  And get rid of your roommate.
Wanna see my driver's license?
Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -
Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Okay, doll.
Are these your bags?
I don't know - but I can feel it right here.  That's one good thing about ulcers - it's like a burglar alarm going off inside you.
Funny?  In what way?
You know, Bienstock, there's something funny about those two new girls.
All right, girls - from the top again.
I beg your pardon.
All right, girls.  Who does this belong to?  Come on, now.  Speak up.  Sugar, I warned you!
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
Yes, Sue?  What is it?
Clarinet - drums - trumpet - trombone -
Hi, Mary Lou - Rosella - Okay, Dolores, get a move on - How's your back, Olga?
Me?  I'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman.
Those idiot broads!  Here we are all packed to go to Miami, and what happens?  The saxophone runs off with a Bible salesman, and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant.  I ought to fire you, Bienstock.
My suitcase - with all my resort clothes.
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?

Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk.  They went to a conservatory.
Upsy-daisy.
You're welcome.
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
Hey, she's ticklish!
The one-legged jockey said - 'Don't worry about me, baby.  I ride side-saddle.'
- so the one-legged jockey said -
Okay.
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
Those two musicians from the garage!
He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
What's the big idea?
I thought you said three years.
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
How did those holes get there?
Where did you girls play before?
This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
What's with him - he drinks?
Yes, I'm holding on.
- and you got to be girls.
- you got to be blonde -
You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
The Florida job?
My car?  Why, you -
Yes, Joe.
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
Why?
It's three weeks in Florida -
You're making it up pretty good so far.
Oh?
What a heel!  I spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled, I buy me a new negligee, I bake him a great big pizza pie...  - and where were you?
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
You got it.  It's six dollars a man.  Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock -
Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.
William Morris!
You got to be under twenty-five -
It's not the backs that worry me.
The instruments are right, but you are not.  I want to speak to Mr. Morris.
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.
All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Show the gentleman to the chapel - pew number three.
PLEASE!
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
Good evening, sir.
Who's going to raid a funeral?
Sorry, sir.  That's reserved for members of the immediate family.
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
What'll it be, sir?
Look, Chief - I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie.
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
Spats Colombo.
I already told you.
Yes, sir.
Orders from Little Bonaparte.
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
No, Spats - no, no, no -  NO!
Honest, Spats.  I had nothing to do with it.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You don't owe me no nothing.
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, youre my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because youve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldnt outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesnt feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I dont know, but your misery just isnt working for me anymore.
You know what? Im not having this conversation right now.
Hey.
So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
Im fine. I promise.
I should get going.
God, Kat! Please. Dont be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Dont worry about it.
The wedding.  I am so, so bad! I dont think I should be allowed to get married.
I dont think I can go through with this.
Bacardi 151.
Oh, shut up and be happy. Its always this or that. Youre never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
But Im not taking your name, buster. Im a feminist!  I need icey! Mr. husband-man, get me more icey!
Perfect. All ginny.
Exactly! Todays my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day.
You know what I love about all this?
And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a Lemondrop every time I see her.
If Ed ever found out....
It was such a long time ago.
You know all that if these walls could talk stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
What for?
Fred Astaire and whats her face!
Last night?
Jeffrey told her last night.
Does Kat know?
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
Say something. Please.
Your probably best off pretending youre asleep.
Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
Youd better get going. My parents will be round to cart you off to the country.
So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave?  You and Amy. Reunited.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Whats going on with you two?
Im an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I dont bake.
It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they havent made up since.
Why should this be any different?  Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.
I blame Tony Pee-Pants!
Oh, dont be that way.
Im sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
Im not as square as my daughter thinks.
Why, with you.
Yeah.
You heading to the train station?
I look like a total wanker, dont I?
Dont be ridiculous. Its late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
Fair enough, but Im stepping on toes here and youre waltzing around like...
I thought you said you were crap.
I think I love you, mate.  How do you know so much about so much?
Just because some slags been paid for, doesnt mean youve got to...you know.
You are taking the piss?
Whos ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?
Doesnt look like nothing.
And you do now?
Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.
But, somehow, it was Kats arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
No.
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
What?
Im so sorry.
Oh, no. He told you.
Like fifteen.
Whats he do anyway?
I wasnt saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
Sure. Youve got to play them against each other. Otherwise they think youre easy.
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havent visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
You want me to let him in?
You want I nut him in the boat?
You pawned it.
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. Youre here for the highland flings, I bet.
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
Oh, well, then. It probably wont work out.
So whyd you let him go?
Ahoy!
Hi, kiddo.
Hard.
I always wondered what happened with us.
Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
Not yet...
Just drunk enough.
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--
What do you say to that?
What is it you do again?
At least somebodys using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
Is there any other way to take it?
Yes mam...
No, Miss Johnson...
She was dirty and wet...
Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--
Yes, Miss Johnson...
:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
:His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
:The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
:--THE STRANGE ENDINGS OF NATURE THEY HAVE SEEN, MAY GIVE THE WORLD NEW POINTS OF VIEW AND MAKE THEIR LOVING, LIVING, AND DOING PRECIOUS TO ALL HUMAN...
You getting the point, Mrs. Boatwright.
You would do that, wouldn't you?
Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!
Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!
No buts, Rita!
I did look, Charlie, but I--
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
NO! N-O, NO!
But, Charlie --
Now look, Rita, I don't make the rules -- you puttin' yourself on a limb, comin' here, askin' me to do a thing like this. And I be damn if I'm going to jeopardize my job because you are in love with a little colored boy!
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
Sunday...
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
What's your daddy's name?
David!
Yes, David...
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
Why don't you try and git you a new dog?
I don't look like no possum!
Then why don't he holler like he usta?
What's in there, David!?
Hello, David...
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
Come, I'll take you home.
I don't know a damn thing, now stop bothering me about it!
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
Don't mention this to anyone! You hear me, David!
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
Would you like to have a cool drink, David?
Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
When you read it we'll talk about it...
It's about the Three Musketeers.
This is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you.
Come in, children.
Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
He said, I don't know, Ike -- you doin' better'n me, I been tryin' to git in there for 200 years and ain't make it yet!
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
Mama, what was we laughin' for?
Is he gon' be gone long?
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
Hi ya, Rebecca...
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.
Whatcha wanta order?
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.
Now go, your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.
Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
There are more important matters right now...
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
I am the clitoris.
Behold my glory.
The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut!
What?
Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!
Success!! Our device works perfectly! We will begin mass production immediately!
Alright, now I want you to say 'horsefucker.'
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
Eric!
Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.
Ze alarms! Zey went off!
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?

Yes, hon?
Oh.
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
Goodnight, honey.
Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
Look, Eric it's your little friends.
No, Eric... I'm afraid it's phase two for you...
Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, I'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. Mkay?
The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today.
Norwegian Ass Raper.
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
I am not a prickfuck, mkay? You little asshole!
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
Mkay.
Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
Eric, that is not appropriate.
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
Eric?
Kyle?!
I know what it is!
Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
What was that word, young man!?
This is it! The time for action is NOW!!  <b>Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done!</b>
You bastards.
Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!
What?
It's that v-chip thing that's inside you, Eric!  The polarity must have been reversed by the electric chair!
Something big, children.
Children, I know ALL there is to know about women.
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
A hunger strike? For what?
It's... It's not good children.
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
How would like some Salisbury Steak with buttered noodles?
Hello there, children!!
This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?

KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
Boobie... This is the only way you're ever going to learn. I have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences.
No... The General is right.
You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
Do as I say, Kyle!
Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
FREEZE!!
Uhh... Bacon.
Uhh... I don't know.
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
It's okay, I am done for.
It's so very cold...
Oh... Alright, back you go.
Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
For pooping, silly.
Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
America... She iz a beetch that sheets on her own children.
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
-Or monkey fucker-
Shiteater-
We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
What is 'fisting'?
Oh dear God...
Right away, ma'am!
I'm needing lunch.
Yes?
And Bill?
Yes ma'am!
Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
Not necessary?!  Mr. President, may I remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake, and our children's minds are the battlefield! The bastard Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. Well, if it is war they want... THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!
Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
Huh?
What about air strikes?
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
Oh God... What have I done...
And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
Oh.
Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
What the hell is going on?!
You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
But I-
Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
Forgive me for saying so, Principal Victoria, but your methods are too... Shall we say... soft?  As head of the PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code.
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
We must take action on this immediately.
Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
The F word?!
No, it was worse than that...
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
Alright, I'll make the call...
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
Then we'll have to resort to plan B and call the v-chip organization.
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
How is the children's progress?
This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
Uh, we're just, starting our program...
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Stan, I never cared for Gregory.
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
Stan! Stan are you okay?!
Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
NAZIS!!
Hi Stan.
You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
Yup.
That's nice, Stan.
And the butfor?
And ze rope?
What do you think this is kid?  Lick Barney the Dinosaur's pussy fucking kiddie hour?  Huh?  This is real life with consequences you take to the grave!
You don't have watches?
Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
They're not going to make it!
Jesus, come on!
Anna...
Anna...
Oh Sara...
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah...
Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...
Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.
I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.
Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
I think we're moving.
Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
Getting drunk is no solution.
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
He's shutting off the air!!!
Oh my God, what is he doing?
Very professional of you.
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
I'm sure I will.
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
It certainly is.
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
So...
Of course, of course...
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
Well I appreciate that.
Magnificent, magnificent.
Oh, thank you.
My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
Koros, as in...Koros?  Dimitri Koros?
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
You're Warren Wayne.
Excuse me?
It can't be.
Evening.
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
My...wings...
The device has stopped responding.
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
They are awaiting further information.
I did nothing to the monitors.
Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.
Well shut it off at once!
Look answer my question!
What did you say to me?
Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
Just don't move around too much.
It's getting hard to breathe...
Will you shut up already?
We're going to die.
Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!
What's the use...we're gonna die...
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Like that piece of ass he was with.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
Look at this...Jesus.
That is one of my priorities.
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
He's in the bathroom.
Where's Taylor?
What is happening around here!!!
How can you sit there with your fat stomach and tell me to take it easy!  I want to go home!  I want to be warm!  I want to get out of here!
Baby, take it easy.
It's getting too cold in here.  I can't stand this anymore!
Talk to him...Jesus...
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
How am I supposed to know?
Well now what are we gonna do!
Send it back if you don't want it.
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...
Besides I can't wait to tee off on the sea of tranquillity. That should shore up that prick Hank Drexler.
I guess so.
Look around you baby, we're rubbing elbows with royalty, oil sheiks, this is class.  You'll be envied by everyone.
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
I'm homesick.
The engines!
What the hell is that?
What makes you so sure?
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
What are you going to do about it?
Again with the orders from you! You got a Napoleon complex chief, and I'm getting sick of it!
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.
Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation.
That's affirmative.
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
One moment please...  one moment please...
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
Just like Junior did the last time; lane six. All's I know is it's gonna be a closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay low. He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven shades, flips up his collar and skulks away.
Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out.
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
Find your bowler?
What kind of man?
You're not from around here, are you?
I'm an addict. I can't go through a day without the stuff. Theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand.
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
Can I get you something for the road?
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
You a mini-golfer?
My poor baby!
Son?
We should leave this town. I can't take this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill you in my house.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
He's the guy Buzz.
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
Hello?
I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes.
I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a piata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.
Cool!
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
You shouldn't touch her.
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.
Who's there!
Who's there?
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
J'you-and-your-friend do it yet?
Junior.
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
Someone wants to play with me?
You made me hurt him!
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
SHEILA!
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
132, 154.
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
Yippy!
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
Strokin'. Here goes nothin'.
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
Like this?
Now swing it out a little to the right...
Yeah.
Line up where you want it.
Grasp firmly. Then what?
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
The Peter Pan.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
He's no father to you.
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
He's not here.
Get that outta your mouth!
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
Open it, Captain!
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.
I can't...
I can't see...
It's burning...
They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs.
They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
In a minute, sir.
If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
In the ship, sir.
Yes, sir.
Nothing, sir.
Nothing, sir.
I'm getting no sub reading, sir.
Subs are still at surface, sir.
Harry?  Can you copy?
Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
It's not sucking, sir.
Working on it now, sir.
Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
What was that, sir?
They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
The others, sir?
They're topside.  We're ready to take you home, sir.
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
Norman Johnson.
You mean they haven't told you yet?
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
This way, sir.
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
You mean you don't know?
Huh?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
They never used to send a Navy car.
Was it a military crash?
There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.
How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
What kind of a crash was it?
Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
Of course, where you been kid?
Forget it, son.
Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?
What's that?
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
Have you been checked out?
You're Starkiller?
Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.
We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.
Send one squad up.
As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
I'll make a report later.
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
Did it occur to you they might find us?
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
There are only three or four left.
Here come six more... grid two!
It could be worse...
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
Who is this?  What's your operating...
With four casualties?!
We'll send a squad up.
It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
No!...
It's too late... We already tested it on Organa Major.  It appears your data never got through.
They'll find its weakness.
The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
It appears your ship had an accident. I will see to it that your death is duely reported.  There will be no one to save you this time.
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
And you?
He'll be well cared for.
There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
Your father's dead.  Don't ever forget who's taking care of you, giving you food, giving you shelter, and giving you the allowance in the first place. If you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here, you won't last very long.  I don't want another word.  Finish your dinner, then finish cleaning those 'droids.'
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
I read you sir.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
Ibanez...LET'S GO !
He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.
Where'd it come from ?
Report.
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
This time of the year...?
Looks like rain.
Oh, my, what's that ?
Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son.
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
...CUT OFF !
Teenagers !
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
Good good, then it's all settled.
Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
Oh, is that how it is ?
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
AAAAAAAAAAA !
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
Bugs don't lay traps... They aren't intelligent ! Unlike you, they're stupid enough to follow orders !
Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
Doesn't look like it to me.
Is that your signature, Rico ?
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
Don't stand there dumb... GO !
Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
Are your parents currently citizens ?
No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
What is your position ?
This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !
<U>Answer</U>!
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
They have repressed the Creator.
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION!
Disclose the information.
You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
The Creator has not answered.
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
You may proceede.
V'ger is that which seeks the Creator.
The Creator is that which created V'ger.
To join with him.
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
V'ger is that which programmed me.
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
'To learn all that is learnable.'
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.
By the Creator.
That is how V'ger will survive.
The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
That is logical. You may procede.
When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
Departure angle.
No.
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
Was he difficult?
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
Decker....!
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
Ten seconds....
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
Twelve seconds...!
My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
'Commander' Decker?
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
Thrusters at station keeping...
Thrusters ahead, one third.
Viewer ahead, sir.
One hundred kilometers...
We're already two settings below that, sir.
Aye, sir.
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
We're losing the pattern...!
The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
To you, sir?
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
We're ready, sir.
Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
Tractor beam remains constant...
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
<U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain!  <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.
The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...
Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...
Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
Helm ready, sir.
Dock control reports ready, sir.
Dock signals clear, Captain.
Transporters Room and Chief Engineer Scott report trans- porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally, sir.
Go you Huskies?
He have any special dietary requirements...?
You bringing your new friend?
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.
I'm goin off-shift.  Come on...I'll walk you home.
I'll walk you home, you can have my coat.
Annie...got an umbrella...?
Evening, Annie.
Well, then, what's he doing here?
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
I know em, I don't know what order they come in...
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.
Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.
Big day last night.
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
Mornin', Doc...
Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.
Ain't got no courthouse.  Courthouse burnt down, 1960.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
What courthouse?
It'll hurt the box office.
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
They're holding it for ransom.
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
Wat...
He's on the ph...
This horse is booked.
Fifteen hands.
It's Marty on the Coast -
Fourteen year old girls.
...they run on water.
I will.
Waterford, Vermont.
...why am I here...?
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
They think it's your First Wife...
That's right.
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.
Her...
I...
...not if you've got something to hold on to.
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.

Bourbon and Milk.
Sure, what have you got?
I don't eat vegetables.
The prices are going up.
If there's anything I...
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
Could I see it please...?
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
I'm very sorry to...
Mr. Barrenger.
Is Mr. Barrenger there...?
Mr. Bailey.
The Mayor's outside.
There's other things to be learned.
It's night.
I wasn't in the car.
No.
Nobody.
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
I, uh...  Um...
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
I'll put the, in your r...
-- she's got 'religion.'
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
She won't stop crying...
I can't tell.
That isn't very nice.
Yes.
<u>Did</u> I?  I think you're mistaken.
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
What?
Well.
Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?
Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...
It's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's sposed to point down to accentuate the <u>genitals</u>, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his <u>ears</u>...?
Why?
Where you off to?
Doug...
...he's the producer of the movie.
Doug, this is Mr...
Doug, the traffic light...
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...?  What's the trouble...?
You bet he did.
Sure.
The writer.
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
A witness to what...?
You should.
He should be put in jail.
My wife just went into labor...
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
Mmmm.  You have children?
My wife's going to have a baby.
I'm looking for the writer.
I...
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
I...?
I'm trying, honey...I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your <u>Mom</u> coming?  Oh.  What did the <u>midwife</u>...?
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
I have to talk to you.  My wife...
I can't find the writer.
I'm very sorry I...
I...
I...
I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over.
Town's out of lilacs.
"Suspicions of arson, these fires, believed set by a disturbed Teenager, were, in fact, the inspiration for the formation of..."
It burnt down.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.

Sherry, Sherry...
I want them thrown in jail.
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.
I am so glad to meet you.  We are so glad to <u>have</u> you here, and <u>welcome</u> you to our...I, you know, they had c...I'm, <u>yearly</u> I redecorate our, to restore it to the, 1835...

I've got two days to get this house...
Sherry, this...
Where the hell have you been...?  It's...
Waal, then, you know, you do whatever would make you happy.  Sher.  This is your party, and whatever...
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
...we don't have thirteen at table...
...not the Lazyboy...
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
And, my <u>wife</u> wanted to, wanted me to ask you, we'd like to <u>welcome</u> you, we'd, she'd like to have you to dinner at our house.  I don't mean to be...

...not at all...
Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to say that anything I could do...
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
And we're glad to have you here...
Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...
Zat true?
Ain't no second chances in life.
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Bet you did.
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
You think so?
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
Zat what it takes?  I always <u>wondered</u> what it took...
It takes all kinds.
She coulda done better than him.
Mmm...
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
...the damn thing...
I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
Yes, I hear it.
You hear that?
But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...
Then I can't do this shot...you wants me to push in--I can't push in through the window...We go back to New Hampshire?
We have to lose the window.
Where are we?
May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...
Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
Have you still never told him?
Let's take our best shot.
At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
Every day.  More and more.
Rachel, <u>don't</u> do this, you will <u>never</u> forgive yourself!
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
You're making a <u>career</u> decision here, I would <u>strongly</u> sugg...
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!
But you're not <u>done</u>!
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Does Jackie know this?
Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?
Oh, yeah?
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
You heard me: leave the table!
What?
Out! Leave the table!
He isn't.
What if he is?
Don't ever say that.
Maybe he's gay.
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.
Thanks, Scoob.
And like, don't take this the wrong way...I mean, I'm cool...but...you know...I've got a good reputation at school and, well...I really don't want it ruined.
You know...Stanley...
There are some rumors...
There's something I need to talk about with you.
Hey.
But that could've happened to him. Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or you.
Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
He was in a concentration camp?
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
Marty, ignore him.
TV talk-show host, OK. You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then TV talk-show host. You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Nice to have you here.
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Really? Well, all right! Let's take a look at the television and see how we look.
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
What?
Yes, Mikey?
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
Don't even joke about that!
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
Sure!...
He's right.
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
It's all about who you know.
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
We used pull.
Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
You started filling out your college applications yet?
Marty...
Got a lot of homework?
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.
The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them.
Ready for tomorrow?
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
How was the class?
What are you going to do?
Is everything OK?
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit aa speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
Reconceive.
Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but 
And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
Tired of this shit...
Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
We have to talk.
Scooby?
Get the hell outta here!
The same. Same as what?
So? How was school today?
What DO you know?
Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
I'm going in there.
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
Come here, give me a hug!
Hey, Mikey!
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
Thanks.
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
One in a million recover.
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
Any books you like to read for fun?
No, thanks.
I mean...
You know...I like you.
Scooby?
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
Scooby, don't! Be careful!
No, I don't think so...
I know.
It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
Thanks.
Times up!
Well, I-I hope that--that--
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
Y-yes--
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!
Is he with the girl?
There isn't anyone! He's opened that whole sector now!
Well get someone down there!
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
Listen man, I don't need this shit--
I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.
I guess not Cooper...
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
Well Cooper...
Well Filmore--
Rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
You're talking about committing suicide!
Because I'll be firing at them.
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
What are you talking about?
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
There's the fence...
Now what?
Used to Filmore, used to.
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face-down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.
What happened?
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
Yeah?...
Cooper...
No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat.  Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
What do you think?
What's that supposed to mean?
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
What do you mean?
You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
Forget about it.
What happened!
Let's move it we got company!
Yeah and we don't have much ammo either!
We don't have time!
--be prepared.
We're outta here--
What now?
Who's got matches?
What are we going to do!
Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager:
Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?
Look Cooper I don't care what my father says, if you embarrass me here you're going to regret it, understand?
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
I said I'll lead.
Why? Are we going dancing?
I'll lead.
The maintenance hatch--it takes us outside the building!
Where does it lead?
That's it!  Up ahead!
We wouldn't have made it out without you. FILMORE Or without you.
It's nothing to worry about.
How's the arm?
Good...
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
Are the labs in operation?
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
How well do you know this place?
Even better.
I have a lighter!
I said I don't want any, goddammit!
I insist...
I don't want any...
Come on, drink up.
Shut up!
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
Yes, you should.
I suppose...you think I should thank you.
Like where--in your dreams?
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...
It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
You got it all backwards, Helen--but that's OK, you work for the government...
You're going to pay for this...
I hope you don't mind all this--it's just that the networks will eat it up, you know...
Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
Go fuck yourself...
I don't know.  If you gave me a reason to...
Are you going to kill us?
Enjoying the tour so far?
You can't think like that!  We're watching them like a hawk--he's bound to trip up, make one false move--
She's as good as gone...
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
He's in there...
What about Cooper--where is he?
Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.
Good.
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
Well?
The transmission is an hour old...
She's still alive.
Came over the satellite.  We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.
They were probably topping off a docked tanker while he stalled for time--without anyone being the wiser...
What!
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
How much do they have?
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
What the hell is it, anyhow?
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
What do you mean?
So, what are we looking at White?
I don't think you--grasp--the situation, Mr. Myers.
The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
And what exactly do they intend to do?
I'll let the senator tell you.
Who's Ryan Cooper?
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his demands.  I can have the money there in an hour.
This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking, skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.
Excellent.
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
What's happening at the waterfront?
You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
Where the hell could they have gone!
Excellent...excellent!
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
Richter-we got a problem!
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.
Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.
We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
How goes the roll call?
The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!
Get your men to do it!
We can't--it's power driven!
Drop the anchor!
If I don't get power up we are!
Are we adrift--
You know, when we reach Kompong Som--
Dissent?
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!
Captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request.
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
Agreed--let's move it.
I say we head out.
Good.
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?
There's enough in one vial...
What does that mean?
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
Just what the hell is he talking about?
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
We have many splendidly deep mines in our country.
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
I know nothing of the sort!
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
But, finally, one factor tipped the scales. We received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one.
First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.
It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
Where are you trying to reach him?
I have your word, Mister President?
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
Thank you, Admiral.
Possibly some coffee?
Can I have a glass of water?
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
You will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people.
One, two...  three, four...  five...  Why you, dirty, stinking...
My seven body orifices????
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left.
It's not a he, General.  It was an article in the "Times" about a year and a half ago.
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?
Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
Give that back to me.
Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing?
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
Now, snap out of it, fella!
Get a grip on yourself, Major!
What are you talking about, Major?
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
That's government property, Major.
So what?
What about the President?
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
What did you say?
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
What is your name, young lady?
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.
I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
No, sir.
General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing.  It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert.  It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R.
What did you say, sir?
General Schmuck?
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --
Well, sir, about forty-six minutes ago one of my base commanders, General Jack D. Ripper, sent out attack orders to the thirty-four B-90's of the 843rd Bomb Wing, under his command.
Well, Mister President.
Yes, sir.
I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.
That certainly would be a problem, sir.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
Thank you, sir.  But what shall I tell them to do if they are denied entrance?
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
I don't think so.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
Roger, maintain.
I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.
Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.
Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.
Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
Maybe it's an exercise.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.
I think they mean business.
They're moving apart.
Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
Look, can't someone help me?
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Shouldn't be bad.  Might even help.  But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.
Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.
Thirty-five, still straight.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Just the missiles.
Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.
Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
I'm sorry, Major Kong.  I guess I was way out of line.
War?
What?
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.
Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
Some kind of signaling.
Where'd they get you?
So am I.
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
Primary arming switch.
Ready, Major.
Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
That's what I'm doing, and it comes out the same.
Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says.
I just got another blast on the CRM-114, and the damned thing decodes: Wing Attack, Plan-R.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
Certainly not, sir.  When they go down into the mine, everyone else will still be alive.  They will have no shocking memories, and the prevailing emotion should be one of a nostalgia for those
When they emerge, a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable, if they are moth-balled in advance.  I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years.
A special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but off-hand, I should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
Mister President, man is an amazingly adaptable creature.  After all, the conditions would be far superior to those, say, of the Nazi concentration camps, where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life.
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
Yes.  The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.
Come on. Inside.
Will you stand up for me?
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
What's up guys?
Uh-huh.
Can you tell me what happened?
Two-fifty? They go up?
So where are you?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
Just one?
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
Don't swear it's impolite.
You know the fuck not.
No car.
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Sorry, Kansas...
Look, it's really not my fault.
I just pulled and it - it came off.
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.
What?!
Wait!  Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant... You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
Conan went to Harvard.
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
Kansas is right.  We're like sisters -- we're closer than sisters.  And you don't turn your back on family.
I'm in, too.
Holy shit.
Bye.
Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
I personally think of how Conan started as a writer, then became a...
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
Di, we're sorry.  We...
Well...uh...they, y'know, uh... They had nicknames.
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.
Another sex dream?
Sorry.  My hands are tied.
Uh, yes.  Yes you did.
Let me explain something...
I'm sorry.
Wrong number  Nooooooo!
Kim-Lo?
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
Fern!  C'mere!  She's siphoning tanks - takes a sec to cap off the cyanide hose.
My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns.
Oh, why didn't you say.  For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you.  The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash.  Take it or leave it.
Right.  That'll be fifteen hundred - cash.
Bullets.
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
Yeah?
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie... I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School.
Or, I could get my own horse...
You want us to help you pick up?
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board?  It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
You damn well better...
Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
You got that big retarded girl down there?
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Is that you down there?
Kansas?
Maybe we can make a deal.
That's Itchy, alright.  How many y'need?
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
Really...
All of you!
Bank branch!
Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month.
Uh...maybe?
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
...so, while it's a laugh riot for the whole family, and Tim Conway is just about as funny as they come, especially when he goes...
But you're not married.
Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.
Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
Action! The scene starts.
Roll 'em.
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
She got to be.  A dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit.  Hold everything.
I hear she was a terror to work with.
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
I didn't mean to --
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...
It must be about that appalling script of hers.  What can I say to her? What can I say?
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
Name dropper.
This is Miss Kramer.
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
Nothing for Ladd?
What's wrong with it?
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.
You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
Gordon Cole... Look, Norma, I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.  Make yourself comfortable.
Gordon Cole?
What assistant?
Yes, I did.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
Hello, young fellow.
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
That's what I want to talk to you about.
We've missed you too, dear.
What's the matter, Norma?
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
Is that So?
We've come for the car.
Joseph C. Gillis?
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Haven't got a thing.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
No, that was me.  I said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture?
Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded.
Got a title?
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?
Maybe what you need is another agent.
Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
Gillis, get this through your head.  I'm not just your agent. It's not the ten per cent.  I'm your friend.
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
Was theft involved?  Did you catch him trying to steal something, or find he had stolen something?
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
Had he been trying to blackmail you?
Did he have a wife?  Did he had a girl friend?  Did you know them?
This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  Where did he come from? Who is he?
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
But what will happen?
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
But where?
Maybe it was just an accident.
Is this Nigel's doing?
No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
Western Europe.
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
What about my proposal?
Hey, where you going?
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
The scoop of the year!
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
Can I give you a lift?
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
Can I quote you?
How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -
Do you have any theories about last night?
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
Why didn't you tell me?
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
Did anybody notice you?
How do you know?
Oh, sure.
-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
As brave as my father. As wise.
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
Superman will return it.
I allowed it to escape the City.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
Can you create life?
I don't understand.
Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head.
Where is Earth?
What's a tree?
What are you making:
What? Me?
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
What can I do for you?
Don't you believe in knocking?
Nope.  Never.
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Brad.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Not enough vodka in it.
S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
Tuesday.
Mr. Roebush?
What are you talkin' about?
What?
Yeah? What do you want?
The kid needs a man to show him --
For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
Hiya, Kent, long time no see. Not that you ever could.  "See" I mean,  Hahaha!
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
Kent!
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
Could you get me Superman's autograph?
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
Do you really know Superman?
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
Mom and I do this all the time.
Oh?
I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
Say!
You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story.
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.

You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
A television set?
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Dishwasher? Any luck?
What kind?
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
Name?
The boss wants to see you.
Gus?
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
How many sugars?
They're just . . . floating around out there. The computer knows where.
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
First paycheck?
Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
Thanks.  Let's go
Just a second.
No...I just have a little stop to make.
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
No, we're just going down.
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
Hey, you're perfectly safe.
How you doing down there?
It was hot!
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
Why do I have to do this?
A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
What about you?
What about me?
All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.
A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera --
I didn't have my camera with me.
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
That's his sister. Vera Webster.
Who's the other woman?
Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
Who is she?
The bridge...?  I'd better get going!
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
Hey, Don't I always get there in time?  Come on, relax.
There's no rush.
You just did, with that great dinner.
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
We've already met.
Anytime.
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
Whoopee.
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
What terrific story?
The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
The picture looks blurry.
That wasn't me. That guy's gone.  And you're next Webster.
But the other night...
I don't know you, lady.
It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and...
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
Tell me.
Lots of things...
I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
I thought you'd never get here.
But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
He can have mine. Anytime.
Oh, Superman!
In other words, push this red button.
Gus?
Where's the light switch?
I can't see anything.
And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
Hey, I know a lot of things!
Diet soda?
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
There is no handle! You just push a button.
Where's the handle?
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
Why do I have to do this?
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
Mr. White, the next number, please?
You've got to pick three more numbers.
Okay? Goodbye.
53!
53.
Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question.
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
Hello.
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
Embezzled, Mr. Webster.  Stolen from the firm.
85,000 dollars.
Are you okay?
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Yeah. I'll check.
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
Does she know about it? She's in it!
That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?!
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?
Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.
Good. My heart can't take it.
You'll miss the battle of the century!
So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
I like trees.
I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
Mush!  Mush!
North!
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
A parka.
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
You'll have to pack quickly.
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
What else is ballast for?
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
It's beautiful.
That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
Why didn't you go before we left?
Wrong.
It has everything.
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
I'll be alright.
Genius!  --  Lex.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
This way Lex.
Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days.
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
What's a curl?
I think he said a "curl."
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Artemis? Do you read me?
Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
Yes.
And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?
But you had more than that, and I know it. You and my father --  you had each other.  Can I never have what you had?
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
Yes, but it's not all I feel.
You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --
Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?
You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.
I didn't ask her anything . . .
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
I asked the right question.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
No possibility for parole?
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
Sensible enough.
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
My kind of people.
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
Now This I want to hear.
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.

Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
Shhhhhhh!
Oh! That black box in our cell?
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
To ski?
Why?
North.
Where?
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
DELETE IN CUTTING
DELETE IN CUTTING
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...
Australia.
What do you want?
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
We will bring him to his knees!
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
He has powers as we do . . .
Constantly.
He flies as well, then . . .
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.
Oh magnificent one. What I am bargaining with is what you do not have -- the son  of Jor-El.
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please.  Wait, -- look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of...
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
Dinner. Oh yes.  I'm sorry, I just never do much about that.  But tonight -- I mean, anything you want, Lois.
So --  I hope you like it.
Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.
You must be freezing.
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --
Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.
Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
I'll have to take the chance. Try to get them all into that molecule chamber. It takes away their powers, reduces them to human beings. Now if you could . . .
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.
Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.
Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times --
Put down Lex Luthor?
Put down Lex Luthor !
North. Keep going North!
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
Cuba.
What more?
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
He ran in fear from us . . .
You said it. Three-to-one should get you 								both ears and the tail.
Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
Who is this . . . Superman?
Zod.  Zod.
I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
It will. Starting with your own.
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
Yes, but will you honor it?
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
We must combine our strength.
General --- ?
Don't worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own.
He's captured Non!
Sentimental idiot.
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
Yes?
This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
You are master of all you survey.
Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
Look, they need a machine to fly.
Stay. I will come to you.
What shall we do now?
So this is the planet Houston . . .
And I will lead.
DELETE IN CUTTING
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
DELETE IN CUTTING 		) There . . .  A place called . . . Houston . . .
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
Free!
Free!
It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
Clark . . . wait!
No Paris?
Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
And what do we get out of it?
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
But Superman isn't an average man.
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
Go on . . .
Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
I'll try. . .
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Awesome!
N-no...I mean...you bet.
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
Absolutely!
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
I'm sorry.
Well, I don't understand.
I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Impossible? Why?
Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
Yes, darling?
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
Mr. White, come with me I want to see
It always is with Clark.
Where's Clark?
Our other dinner guest.
Something . . . wonderful.
But he's never there.
And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
Who?
An angle?
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
. . . And  very nave!
Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
I am master now.
Destiny.
What do you fear?
First, I have fun.
Destroy Superman!
I am an experiment? I am freako?
You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
You are . . .
What I need this for?
No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
I'll deal with you later.
Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex Luthor. And you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I'm taking you in.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
I'm not going anywhere.
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
Me?
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
--  thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of  --
It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
We're running out of smoke.
Thank you.
He's thirty-five years old.
Nobody else.
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
Bunkers!
I know, but  --
It's for that piece she's doing on women and competition. She's off to the Women's Western Golf Classic.
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
A hot story, huh?
You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
Keep warm now.
Do you know where you're headed?
I know son, I know...
He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
I know.
Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
I know you're a good boy, Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that...
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
If you persist, you leave us no choice.
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
And if I don't obey?
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
But so is Vond-El
Then -
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
Boy!
Two.
What're you writing, Lois?
I bless the day you came to us, son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand.
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
Oh, dear. That isn't what I --
Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
We don't want a child called 'Junior,' ain't that so, Clark? Why sure it is.
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
Folks'll ask question.
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
He sure as heck does that.
The good lord works in mysterious ways.
All of us.
Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
Don't just stand there gapin' Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold?
What's your name, boy?
It's a ...baby.
Then you have on of those 'feelings.' It was called: 'love.'
I want to know what my child is going to face.
You've been doing some research in the archives.
Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
He will be odd, different.
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
He'll be weightless.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
Lara, please...
-- as we will be.
It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
And it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. All you can do, Kal-El, even now that you have...found yourself...is help them to evolve. Set an example. Show them they must strive towards the light. And... remember us...
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
How good it felt!
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
Enjoyed it?
Whoever comes up with that will make Woodward and Bernstein look like Abbot and Costello.
If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
I was going to say that there's only one 'p' in subpoena. What the hell did you major in at Radcliffe? Middle English?  Nice job on the teamster's update, Kent.
Lois, the kickback story...
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
I hope she gets better.
Say hi to Zoe.
Alison.
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
What happened?
What happened?
I...don't think so.
That's okay.
What...does it turn to?
She's in trouble?
But you said...
Then...when did she get better?
So there were others?
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
Which one?
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
I'd heard that.  But she's well?
How is Mrs. Stephens?
He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
How are you?
Ally.  That was my nickname.
Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.
She's resting.  In her room.
Billy, please.  The children.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
Away from your crazy Mom.
It's for the school bazaar.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
You hate it.
What do you think?
Hi, Dolores.
We've only got honey.
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...
You want a cup of tea or something?
Nicole!
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?
No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
Yes.  It's a present.
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
So do you like your new room?
We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
Well, winter's far behind us now.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
Isn't it a lovely day?
Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
That's what he said.
Jenny, it's time for you to go to bed.
No.
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
Okay.
Oh.
So he was mean?
The people in the town?
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
Nicole?
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
Nicole?
What's vermin again?
Oh.
What's a ditty again?
Thanks.
Perfect.
Almost three.
Tell me about it.
Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
Yes.
We do.
Poached salmon.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
Some more wine?
Do you have this agreement with you?
Are you expensive?
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
So you're just the thing we need.
You think someone else caused the accident?
Dolores?
Who did they get for that?
Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
You've been retained?
No.
You can't come here.
Who are you?
Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.
Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
Are you a reporter?
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters.  They're all inbred.
Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night.  Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.
Yeah, right.
That's the horse!  Shotgun - Shotgun in the fifth!
Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
Where are we running?  What am I missing here?
Hitler!
Will you mind your own business!
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.
How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
Loretta...Sidney Falco...
He's somewhere...
Yeah, having supper with the Mrs. She's over there.
Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?
A Senator, an Agent and Something - With - Long - Red - Hair.
But of course...
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here.  He lives on the whole top floor.
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
We're on our way there now...
...excited with good reason, I wanted to say.  Because this endangers the future of the whole quintet...
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
Did she accept?
Come on boys, break it up...
...People catch on quick to such an item.  Van Cleve already called me - he's firing the quintet.
I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.
Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
I only had a few hours.
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
Hurry back.
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
Right!
Friends call me Otis - sometimes Tricky Otis.
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
If it were that easy, you wouldn't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours...
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.  Hey, wait a minute!
Why does everything you say sound like a threat?
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
Now, come, J.J., that's a little too harsh.  Anyone seems fair game for you tonight.
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
I don't believe it.
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
I just checked "downtown".  Quiet everywhere tonight.
Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?
Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
Is that a fact?  He's a dilly, ain't he?  By the by, what did he have against this boy?
...And he's got them on him.  I appreciate a thing like that - I appreciate where you are looking out for the virtue of the city.
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
What's all the rush?  You said three o'clock.
I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
Bribing me again?
Could this be that boy?
Something about a Frank D'Angelo trying to reach you...
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
Good!  We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
Cheers.  What time is it, Al?
Did you now?  On which bounce?
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
Yeah.  A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week!  This is my press agent, Joan.
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.
I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis close.
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here.
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
I can't
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
You going to work all day?
We should abort.
I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.
They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.
They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.
Do you know about the chip?
Please... let... the kids... go...
No good.
Alright, yeah.  You're right.  We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here.  Everything! I don't care.
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
My God.
In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?
No shit?
So she's pretty cool, huh?
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
I love you.  I always will.
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
Open the goddamn door!
You broke my arm!
You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
I see.  So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
And what it that?
You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  Everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!
Relax now, Sarah --
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
Please continue...
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --
Our duty is to help Furtwngler with his defence,  That's why I want you to look at this...  These are part of the transcripts of the trial at Nuremberg. We can't get them translated fast enough. But I guess you understand German, right?
You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.
On Furtwngler.
Where do you stand on all this?
Then you're going to kill me.
Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture.
Let Furtwngler go. Please.
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwngler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
A great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone.
Furtwngler's in a different category.
I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - unequalled.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.
I don't know what you mean, Major.
Yes.
Yes, Dr. Furtwngler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
He was forced to do that. But he refused to give the Nazi salute in front of Hitler. He kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand.
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwngler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwngler.
Well, he's more than just a bandleader, Steve. He's a great conductor, a gifted artist. But we believe that he sold himself to the devil. Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party. Don't be impressed by him. I want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. Find Wilhelm Furtwngler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
You were in insurance before the war.
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
So, you never heard of him.
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwngler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
Dr. Furtwngler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
Absolutely not.
First oboe.
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
Can you handle it?
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
You're late.
Come to the office, please.
Wrong.
You can't to that...
All.
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
You know your weapons, buddy.
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
Just what you see, pal.
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
Anything else?
We will, kiddo.
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.
Not lately.  Did you check messages?
Don't wear the beige one.
Alright, the beige one.
Great.
Great.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?
That's none of your business.
What's it to ya?
I can help you...
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
Why were the other two women killed?
Of course.
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Why?
Then how are you supposed to get back?
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
And who was the enemy?
The year 2027?
So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?
They've already been identi- fied.  There's no doubt.
Here, drink some of this...
Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Shut up.
That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--
Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...
Go!  Go!  He's got her.
Like shit, boss.
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?
To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
Same shit.
Call her again.
I just called.
Call her.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
Send a unit.
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
Did you reach the next girl yet?
I put a cigarette out in it.
I know.
That stuff's two hours cold.
I hate the weird ones.
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
Here's her driver's license.
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
Give me the short version.
We met, this morning.  I signed the termination contract for Baer/Grace. I accepted your settlement, Nicholas. you were right.  I'm going sailing.
Are you finished?
I could fight you on this.
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
Now, look...
Your father was a friend.  Goddamn it... I watched you grow up.  How do you end up treating me like this?
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
The stock will turn.
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
Projections were far too optimistic.
"Whereas once I was blind, now I can see."  Night, Nick.  Best of luck.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
Did you?  Kudos.
I'll be right with you.
Clean out your locker.
You don't talk to me like that.
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
And, they didn't take that watch?
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
Have you gone to the police?
Robbed?
It always is.
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
I know.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
I hope.
Yes.
Of course, Nick...
There's nothing to forgive.
Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
I've been so lonely.
They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
Didn't I give you two?
Hm?
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...
There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said.  The police took him.  They left this address, in case anyone...
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
A Mister... Seymour Butts.
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
Your ex-wife.
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
Hey... !
Friend... why don't you back off.
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm just driving...
What the fuck... ?!
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
What about the house?
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
You're joking.
Nothing else?
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
You know you can.
How concerned should I be?
Nicholas...
What's happened...
I checked it personally.
Attractive...
Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
Anything wrong... ?
<u>Every</u> year is a good year.
What?
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
Greetings fellow sheep counter.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
It's somebody's idea of a joke.
I did okay.
Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
Who's Watts?
Obsessive worrier.  Join the club.  And you?  I'd guess...
And what kind of sleeper?
Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...
You're not telling us something.
It's not going to hold your weight.
She got the child labor stuff from me.
Is that the question of compassion or science?
Do we still get paid for the week?
There's a carriage house around back.
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
Why?
Sure.
That could have been worse.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
Greetings.
We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
Where in the hell can she be.
-- how much is this car worth?
You used the wrong test.
You want company?
All night?
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
I didn't do it.
Well, this lot is full!
Hey!  I heard screaming...
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
I, I just can't...
Does she know that's why you're using her?
You don't believe in the paranormal.
Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.
Are you working with her?
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
And that will be a good place to end this study.
It's still an electric shock!
What happened?
This is where we're going?
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts.
How'd I know it was for you?
Test it.
You're going to publish, he's going to perish... And why did you hire me for this?
You know what he's really upset about?
Can't say.  Haven't been here that long.  Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work.
She was unhappy.
Why'd she kill herself?
Rene Crain.  Up there.  Rope. Ship's hawser.  Hard to tie. Don't know how she got it.
That's where she hanged herself.
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
What do you want?
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
-- no one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.  No one will come any nearer than that.  In the night.  In the dark.
It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
So far.
It's make the soup or answer the door.  Can't do both.
That's why I'm letting you take care of this.  I'm the one with appearances to maintain.  But who gives a shit about you?  Not even God.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
When you find the guy, you'll know.
Same as last time -- the rest after.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
How they goin', kid?
Come over here.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
We'll find him.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
What did you tell them.
You should have let me do the talking.
Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you.
No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
There's been some trouble downtown.
Huh?
Fuck you.
You broke last time.
No problem.  If <u>you</u> don't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen.
I can take care of the paperwork.
Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece.
You're in gun country now, my friend.
You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
Oh really?  Where you from?
Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the market.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
Man knows what he likes.
What am I doing?
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
Of the deal, man.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
It was you.  Downtown.
So what's your beef, pal?
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
Yeah, I guess you are.
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
He had urgent business in the north.
Where is he now?
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
A <u>statement</u>?  I wouldn't mind getting a statement.  You see, <u>my</u> client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.
You sure?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
Don't you work with Ian?
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
Sounds like you need a rest.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
Nine years?  Is that legal?
Where else?
No rest for the wicked.
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
You're a reluctant traveller, then.
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
What do you think?
Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
Jennifer Wilson.
So why would he want to see you.
He's expecting you?
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
How'd you get in here.
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
Who's looking for you?
Are you finished?
You know I don't live with him.
-- You know his name is Frank.
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
What kind of trouble are you in?
I don't want you here, Terry.
They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
Since when?
What are you doing here?
Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed.
And you should tell Doris...
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
Yes. Thank you.
Hello, Ed.
Then you listen to me, for I am expert. That girl, she give me a headache. She cannot play. Nice girl. Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday, I think, maybe, she make a very good typist.
...she can go up there.
Ah, but that is just what I cannot teach. I cannot teach her to have a soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano, is not about the fingers. *Done* with the fingers, yes. But the music, she is inside. Inside, monsieur...
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.
...Mm.
Ah.
Ah yes, a music lover.
I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music?
...You are ze fahzer?
...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.
I, uh... thanks.
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
You sure you don't want something stiffer?
Rye.
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
Ed, how're you holding up?
Yeah, the best.
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
...Probity.
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
No thanks, honey.
Coffee, Ed?
Taking it seriously.
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
OK. Boy. Jesus!
Sure you don't need one?
Oh, hell. Drink?
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
What'd he say?
He's the dead guy.
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
Huh? No.
Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
Hello!
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
...You're Ed Crane?
You also have an interest in the securing property?
Mr...?
'Lo, Ed.
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
Not an owner.
Ah.
Could you come with me please?
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
He said OK. Is that what he said?
What'd he say? Does he understand?
Under arrest for murder.
You'll go to the prison hospital.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
Uh... you're under arrest.
His eyes are open.
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... He's the decedent.
Homicide.
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
They sent us to tell ya.
...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.
I'm in.
Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.
No one broke into this room, sir. Someone broke out.  That lock was torn off from the <u>inside</u>.
Why not?
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.
The claws are sharp... I must have cut myself.  Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe.
Looks like the curse is still at work.
Doesn't look like it.  We're damned lucky.  This statue is priceless.
Anything missin'?
Someone broke into this room.
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
Sweet Jesus!
He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good shape.  Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious.  There's no reason to call off the opening now.
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
I appreciate that.
I don't want to scare people.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
Fifteen... what's next?
Oh Jesus...
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
Just a minute.  I'm shaking!  Take the gun.
Hurry up!
That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.
Let's go!
Battery's dead.  Shit.
Calm down.  I found it!
Forget it!
I'll do it.  Just let me find my portable phone.
What's the combination?
Behind you.
Where's the walk-in safe?
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
Like hell!
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
You don't know much about computers, Lieutenant.  There are safeguards built in.  We have back-up systems with redundancies.  There's no way these computers can fail.
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll just scare people off.  I can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  It's state of the art.
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
Dr. John Whittlesley.
What's that?
I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
Oh shit.
You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
It's still back there!
What happened?!
It's important.  Please.  You have to come!  Pendergast, too.  She's found out something.
Dr. Green has to see you!
Lieutenant!  It's me.
Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
Curious.  There's something missing.
Right.  The entire brain appears to have been extracted.  May I see it, please?
What are we talking about here?
Lovely bouquet.  After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check.
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
What do you do?
You work here?
You're color blind.
They were yellow!
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
Like this.
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
Not that big.
Big as a house.
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
I don't know.  But I think it's bad.
What is it?
Quiet!
Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
I don't want to go this way.
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
We're not supposed to go back there.
Let's ditch and find them ourselves.
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
This room sucks.
Oh no.  I smell it.
Jesus, what is this?
Oh... my... God!
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?
Argo!  Hobbes!
Holy mother, what is that?
Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
They've got something.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
Is Dr. Frock safe!
Eats them?
So what?
4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
What kind of egg is it?
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
What do you make of it, Margo?
What's that?
Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
Frock's been fired.
Margo, you haven't heard?
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
You want to book the flight?
I thought you were in a hurry.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
It's the busy season.
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
Viti Levu.  For how many?
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
Where exactly?
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?
He doesn't care.
What music?
Why would we--
It's just a matter of time.
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.
He has to be on foot.  He has the world's most recognizable face.  He can't disappear.
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.
He gave it back to his father.
He was tidying up his garbage.  I was going to call you.  But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep.
What's to see?
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
Close up?
I can't believe he married Meryl on the rebound.
Because his mother got sick - very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?
Shhh!
The memory of who?
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
What's he doing?
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
Sure she would.
You think she'd go through with it?
Why not?
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
How can they have a child?
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?
Well, what do you want to do?
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
Now.
No.
No...I, er.
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
That's right.  Lauren.
Oh, yes.
Things always do--when you look back.
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
You know he was an only child, like you.  I know how bad you feel about what happened--sailing into that storm.  But I don't blame you, Truman.  I never have.
--Darling--
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces.  I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
I feel certain my condition runs in the family.  Can't this wait, dear?
You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's?
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
Oh, just so.
Well, I made it through another night.
Fine.  I'll tell her.
When you get to Fiji?
I'll try.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
You're welcome, Truman.
The whole area's being evacuated.
Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.
You must listen.  Everybody's pretending, Truman.
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
They're going to stop me talking to you.
They're coming.  Any minute.
See you tomorrow, Truman.
I'd ask for identification.
Good.  Good.
How's it going, Truman?
You're not FBI agents.
We don't even know you.
Not supposed to talk about it.
Yeah.
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
I think that about does it, Spooky.
What do you do?
A woman?  Work.
Poopy day?
Me?
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
Working with?
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
You've been back to Dallas?
Evidence of what?
Special Agent Scully --
They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.
Of what?
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
Incinerate it. Like the others.
And if it's unsuccessful?
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
How can this be?
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
This man's still alive.
Heat, I think. The coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six.
Brought on by what?
We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
Yes.
You've got something to show me.
Kurtzweil, we think.
Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
There are complications.
Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.
Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
You looking for him for some other reason?
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
Looking for him for what?
You got some kind of business with him?
Show you right on a map.
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
I don't have his number.
I don't know anything about that.
General McAddie's.
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
What are you doing?
I'm not taking any chances.
I don't know.
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
Agent Mulder --
Agent Scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. That you wanted to go back.
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
And Mulder?
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
Mocky-Lock.
's broken.
You liked him?
I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious.
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
Already there.
Agent Cole.
She the one from Santa Cruz?
Instead of going into his mind...
It would take hours to re-route the system, and even if I did, I shouldn't.
She changed the codes.
I think that's the whole point.
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
Initiating connection.
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
Now?
So?
Someone looking after her little girl?
You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary.  I don't care.
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
Next time, tell me, okay?
That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die.
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
You sure you want to go through with this?
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.
Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
Warscheinlich ist der murder.

Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
Keep the packet.
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr. Martins...
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.
Well, I've got it when you want it, miss.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
They'll be returned, miss.
I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.
Just around the corner.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
I was a friend of Harry Lime.
Can I have that woman's passport?
Thank you.
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
This is forgery. It is very clever.
Shall I go over there, sir?
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
Very good, sir.
This way, miss.
I'm so glad to have met you, sir. I've read quite a few of your books.
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
I'll look it up for you.
Do you know his number?
...excuse me.
Oh, Mr. Martins...
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
Very popular, sir.
Striptease, sir.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
Mr. Crabbin.
Are you mad?
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Yes. The man who helped carry him.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
But you will.
...the best way one can, you know.
I live in the Russian sector, but you'll find me at the Casanova Club every night. One has to work...
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
A Roumanian.
...you know and all that.
...were of you.
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
At the end of every chapter --
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.
Zwei zwartze.
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
Not necessarily.
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
I understand...
I can tell you very little. He was run over by a car. He was dead when I arrived.
Find out?
I have guests waiting.
Coming to the point, please.
Yes.
Vinkel.
...Mr. Martins?
Why no, Mr. Martins.
...this time.
Mr. Martins...
A novel, Mr. Martins?
Joseph Harbin? No...no.
No.
Not necessarily.
What else did he tell you?
Will we never teach these Austrians to be good citizens. It was his duty to give the evidence.
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
What else?
Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
Funny?
Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
Okay.
His name?
Where are you staying?
What's the purpose of your visit here?
Passport, please.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
What about Moliere?
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
She is gone!
I'm sorry.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
Yes.
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
A fin!
Richard - I saw a fin!
We're ok.
So how many miles do you think it is?
So?
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
Why?
One or two kilometers.
He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.
There is one problem.
It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath.
Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
We moved rooms because of him.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Good morning.
Richard?
Two.
One kilometer
You can swim?
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
But he has been there, off course.
It's on an island that no one get to.
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
He tried to borrow money from us.
Too far?
It's just the sky, Richard.
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
Richard, you know something -
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
Incredible.
One night I will get the perfect photograph.
Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky.
I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.
Have you told someone?
We swim.
Hi.
I hope our noise did not keep you awake.
Did you sleep well?
Bonsoir.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
Do you know the Kentucky friend mouse story?"
We lost our key.
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror....
Watch your language....
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
No one follows that midrash.
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
You think?! Based on what?
We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
They sound like you.
They don't have extermination camps.
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters.
That's a movie, you moron.
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
What??
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?
He's an asshole.
Fucking Danny, man...
She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front....
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
Why the fuck not?
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
How come you know all this shit?
Fire...
Let's look at the fucking thing.
What do you care?
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and --
Why'd we have to leave so fast?
Do we have to listen to this shit?
You coming?
What, do you like it here?
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
Who the fuck are you?
Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now. What's the difference?
You will.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore.  There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.
Yeah, I read your piece. It's very smart. And very wrong.
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
That's a much easier game.
I doubt it. How did you find out?
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
Why are you taking that?
What'd you say?
Who's Eichmann?
I thought there were people here....
We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
Did you see how they reacted to him?
Yes!
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
You do it on the inside....
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
What is happening?
Hello...?
We want to talk to you about something....  We're about to launch an aboveground, intellectually serious fascist movement.
How have things been going?
Forget Manzetti.... Take on something simple. Something you can actually accomplish.  Maybe he'd be more valuable in the city.
Do you feel you're making progress here?
So what Jew would you kill first?
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
What part of Germany are you people from?
Balint?
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
Steve...
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
That's meat.
You can heat them up and eat with him.
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
Tell it to Hitler.
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...
Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
What are you doing here?
A Jewish prayer.
Isn't it true?
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.
Listen, Danny, you can't just barge in and --
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
You remember Miriam....
Are you an artist?
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
What's that?
You missed on purpose.
Just get him in the cross-hairs. With those shells, anywhere you hit him, it'll bounce around, rip his insides all up.
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
I was a Jew in a previous life.
I can tell....
Four. But no one this important.
You want to kill a Jew. I already did.
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
Where do you think you're going?
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
You can't say that....
What are you trying to say?
Just a little... What's the difference?
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
He was funny.
Funny?
Obviously.
Leary?
Who's this?
Exactly.
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?
Do I give a shit?
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
Are you out of your mind?!
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
What?
I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they?
So what?
Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
We think you'd be good at it.
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.
As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
And let us say...
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....
And so, on this, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that --
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
What do you mean?
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....
... You take care of yourself, Johana.
Did you tell him?
I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
But your man isn't quite a God!
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
Does he know?
Are you going to keep it?
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
He's shy, not like Enzo.
You're going to live here permanently?
What does that mean?
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
Lira?
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
He's training.
Where did you get that?
The medics are looking all over for you.
Enzo, wake up!
What about the shoes?
Yes?
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
Six seconds.
Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
I didn't say...  Brussels!
Noireuter.
The rules are the rules.
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
Who?
Tea... or whiskey?
A drink to warm up?
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Positive, Sir.
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
That's different!  What's the matter with you?
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
I'm going to put a lock on the telephone.  Did you bring the cassettes?
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
In my apartment?
Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
No, no.  It's true.  When I was in New York, oh boy!  Before my accident, you understand?
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
Where are you from, Henrietta?
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
Assassin!
Where I saw the mermaids?!  Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question!  We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit!
Why don't you ask me?
Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?
Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
Yes... It's magic.
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
Of course, that's what they're for.
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
Let him sleep.
... Yes?
Then, goodbye.
Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
Coffee might be nice.
For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew.
It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
He isn't going to breathe.
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
In the spring when he melts!
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
Please. Will you help me?
My Esther! Oh Mordechai.
So why the long face?
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
About an hour ago, we received this transmission from the North Pole.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...
Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
What's your first move?
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
He works too much. God forbid he should have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him once in a while. Take his mind off his work. Maybe a blowjob here and there.
Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl.  I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.
You like my Mordechai, yes?
From the story of Purim.  Well, now that we're all acquainted, let's sit down and start the Sabbath.
So. Do you have a name?
What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
Mazel Tov!
...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
Do what you must.
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.
You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.
She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
Happy Hanukkah Morty.
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.
I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering?  Girls.
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
No dipshit, I want you to kill him.
You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?
It's Friday.
What day is it?
Resting?
Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.
Take a look.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes.
Get off of me you cripple!
I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
You okay?
Thanks. Oh, did I tell you. I picked up that new KC and the Sunshine Band record that you recommended. You were right, it is good.
No, it was the perfect level.
I wasn't too over the top?
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
So, how was I?
That's some cold shit.
Bootleg copies of the Frank Capra classic, 'It's A Wonderful Life.'
Worse.
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
What should I charge?
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
You get your money from your husband.
What about me?
This is for "mama and the kids."
Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
I don't know -
Is he in love with you?
Nice fellow?
Mmmyes.
Good looking?
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and -
Why not -- if you like it - if that's what you really want.
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
That depends. How much money has he?
My soninlaw. What do you think of him?
Why not?
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
Tomorrow -
See you tomorrow -
Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
The death card - -
Let me see it 
Don't look at it!
Go on -
Something black - something on its way to you 
What are you doing that for?
Cut.
The elderly man I told you about.
Who?
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
What did they say before the bad card came up?
All men are fools. They like to make a big show - shout and hunt --
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
It's a blackcard and bad card, but not the card of the cat - not the card of fourfooted things.
I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too  when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people.  But these last weeks will always be our secret  a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
Love is different for different people.
When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
What, senorita?
Rosita  I have wondered -
Pedro is waiting for me, too.
At four. He will be there at four.
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
He will be waiting...
I'll miss you too, honey --
Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't 
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
Oh, that's so interesting!
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life - and I still don't know what the Procession means.
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money  not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
I am not interested in what somebody else thinks. You being me facts and I'll act on them.
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
Why?
Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
What are you getting at?
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
Go on foot.
You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
You a tourist?
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
Aint nobody out there, Mister.
Must it?
Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
I work here, sir. Im here most of the time.
Mr De Moraes is due back from Brazil late this evening. Mrs De Moraes is out and not expected before eight. Do you wish...
Im afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
Good afternoon. De Moraess residence.
That would be Mrs De Moraes mother, Sir. Mr and Mrs Spitz are here with their daughter.
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes majordomo. They are expecting you.
Will you please come with me?
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
Theres nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
01766 770 471. Let me check it for you, sir.
Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
Im sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
Crow what?
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
Shell be alright. Shes tough...
Emily...
Weve still got the Italian...
Most of our information comes out of the mouths of babes, Mr Lombard - confused and frightened victims. Its all too easily discredited, you understand. Now, you might be just what weve been waiting for. Your information could be enough to make em sit up and listen.
Hi...
And losing you, wed lose him. And that would be a shame, dont you agree?
Have the money ready by 11am. Well call you.
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
Im afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
How much of a hurry are you in?
So, what are you looking for?
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
This is a bad line.
May I have your phone number?
Have we done business before?
I certainly did, sir...
Got it. Puppies.
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
Im sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir.  Would you like to leave a message?
We need a double-room and as I understand youre here alone wed be much obliged if youd agree to move to a single room...
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. Im terribly sorry to disturb you but theres been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
Le Mercury. Newman street. Ask for Peter.
At what time will you be available?
Its about the puppy. You got the money?
You must agree to be blindfolded...  Just for the journey. It might appear unseemly - youre the paying customer - but ordinarily clients come with some kind of endorsement.
Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian?
Your lady friend did.
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
I gather weve done business with a friend of yours?
Five to three. Youre early.
Im sorry...
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
Leon? No. Im afraid he left.
Evening. Table for one?
Is that where lawyers toil for an industry that turns serial killers into heroes who give thrills to young women who write erotic novels about psychopaths and rapists?  You go to your world, Ill stay in mine. So long, Mister.
Barstows 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever youre heading, I reckon somebodyll pick you up.
Im sure you would. But if I had one, I wouldnt let you near it. Now you tuck back in and rest until youre told otherwise.  And for what its worth, I wouldnt try anything that might be construed as unappreciative of my hospitality. Id sooner shoot you than have you upset me...
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Huh... I guess you aint quite ready for civilisation yet... Ill give you one more day, a meal, and then youre on your way.
Three days and thats three days too many.Come on. Get your ass up.
Now, can you stand up?  Can you use your legs and stand up?
I didnt think so. The rags on their sorry backs are the only wordly possessions those wretched creatures are ever found with...  I dont wanna know who you are or how come you ended up roasting in Owl Canyon. But you might as well know Id have let you fry to a buzzard meal if not for this...
And you aint neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
Yeah. Why? Youre going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I dont really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. Thats how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
Oh. Thatd be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
What about which girlfriend?
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just aint worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of em.
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You dont know Leon, do you?
No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.
I hear youre looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leons gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
Welcome to the club.
We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.
Then why dont you reach him?
A lachat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais a pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. Cest pas vraiment mon truc.  I dont know any Austrian, Xavier.
Alors quoi?
Eh bien... Tes sr que tas besoin de moi?  La petite ma lair assez bien foutue, non?
O est pass ton salon?
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...
Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matine.
Cinq cents.
Quest-ce que tu veux?
Huh. Im a businessman. What are you, eh?
What you gonna do? Kill me?
When they realise Im missing...
Thats what he said...
Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didnt need your confession...
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman whod called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
I can only tell you what he told us...
Thats the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to, eh, French-fuck?
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldnt go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
What do you think, huh?
If he had, youd be dead.
Thats just it. The sonofabitch didnt ask for help from his colleagues...  Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasnt gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didnt you know?
Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. Its wrong. Fucking wrong.
Huh! Youve been around, eh?
Youre the lantern man, huh?  If you wanna see whats left of him...
Glucks dead, you sonofabitch!
Fuck...
Figlio di puttana. Youre the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
Who?  I dont know who the fuck youre talking about, sunshine.
Its a good guess...
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, Id watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The ladys also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasnt easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, whats your business with these Spitzes?
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
Very funny. Can I go on now?
I dont know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
What do you think?
Whats that? A word?
Costliest!
Cost what?
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become have-it- where-its-at... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
Sound the retreat...
Good.
Performing a miracle.
W-w-what are you doing?!
No no, you don't understand -- this is no ordinary oil -- this is miraculous... this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown King Clovis in this... very... cathedral...
Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
And when was that?
I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?
Well find some other way!  Be creative.  Tell them she fucks the devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that?  Sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't?
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
Scared of a girl?
Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
Well then?  Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
We want her burned as a witch!
To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
Who's running this trial, you or her?  I can't believe it!  This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
Rouen is in English territory.  I have the right to do anything I like.  Take them away.
Arrest them!
And God who allowed you to be caught?
Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
Guess.
Dead you're worthless, darling.
So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English?  You look pretty ordinary to me...
I'll be right here... I promise.
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
Quick -- hide in here...
Really?
I was so worried -- we've all been looking for you!  The English are everywhere!  O thank you, lord!
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
I understand.  How much?
Buying her?
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
He's feeling wonderful.
Then her faith will have to be bigger.
Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.
You're a fine judge of character, Charles.  It'll take you less than five minutes to expose her if she's a fake.  But if she's not -- then she will give you your answers... and place the crown on your head.
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
Noooo!
There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier?  They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money.  Who's going to pay them?
... as always, majesty...
Your majesty, I really think you...
Supposing she's an assassin?
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
The other half.
Not exactly.  She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse.  Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.
If she comes from Burgundy it makes a difference.  It might be a trap...  Look... Signed "X".  What sort of name is "X"?  Or must we conclude that a messenger of God can't even write her own name?
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!
That's enough!  You will answer the question... or face the consequences!
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
Is it long and hanging down?
Does he have hair?
You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
20,000 gold crowns.
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
That's not a lot.
5,000 gold crowns.
The English won't wait.
Well...?  Shall we go?
We need another ten minutes...
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
What's going on?
The wind will be against us...
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.  The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?
So... what is the message?
Fine -- go now if you want, but not with me!  You may have a duty to God but I have a duty to my people, and my people are starving!  So right now I'm going to take the food back to the city, and if you can please calm down, and let me accompany you to Orleans, it will be my honor to welcome you.
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Wait, wait...
He's on the other side of the river.
I know...
Everywhere.  Where is the food?
Yes... they were.
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
Yes, it's a miracle.
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
No good?  This is a disaster!
This is no good!
Good idea...
Yes.  We can pray.
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
Me too...
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
Oh, but I forgot!  It was a Sunday... that explains it.  God's day off.
Damn right!
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
That'll put fire in my soldiers!
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
To hell with your voices -- it's time to face facts!  We have nothing to do here... none of us... not even you.  You should go home, Jeanne.
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
Do you know how to count?
Jeanne, look behind you.
Reinforcements?  Where??
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
For weeks you've been asking for this... well now you have it!
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
Perfectly.
But the bridge has been pulled down!
And... what does Jeanne think?
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...
Who told you to wear men's clothes?
Oh?  Perhaps someone pushed you then?
And you didn't jump of your free will?
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
Did your voice tell you to jump?
Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
Yeah...
Besides, what about these...?
Why not?  He has good teeth...
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth...
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
How many did he give you?
Who gave you that horse?
When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they hang them for helping Jews.
A beauty. Who is she?
Someone you know?
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
He's still a doctor.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
I'm going to get a doctor.
Oh, yes. I remember.
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
Dead.
Just over a year.
He'll be here soon.
He'll be back before curfew.
Michal Dzikiewicz. He's my husband.
Sit.
Come in! come in!
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
No one plays Chopin like you.
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
Really?
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
Will I still be able to play?
What did I tell you?
That's your decision.  But when they storm the flat, throw yourself out of die window - don't let them get you alive. I have poison on me, they won't get me alive either!
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
I'm on the run!
Get your things together, you have to leave!
Here.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
It's not going to be very comfortable.
Thanks.
What?
What?
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
Have you seen this?
Who told you?
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
It costs.
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Tough luck.
I haven't seen him.
I'm doing you people a favour. And what about you, Wladek? You're a great pianist. And we've got an excellent police jazz band. They'd welcome you with open arms. Join us. You've got no work...
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
We're recruiting.
Boys, boys...
Henryk, I said nothing bad.
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
Do they?
What d'you mean, take the table away?
What good? Wladek, I'm surprised at you. They died with  dignity, that's what good it did. And you know something else?  Now the Poles will rise. We're ready. We'll fight, too. You'll see.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
Please, don't insult us.  Can you do something for him?
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Why didn't you come to me?
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
There are always notices going up.
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
Bad news, you crazy? You have no world view, Wladek, that's your trouble. The news couldn't be better. The moment Hitler invaded Russia, I knew we'd be all right. Remember Napoleon. Same business. The Germans will freeze to death, please God.
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
Wladek! How are you?
Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
I was listening, Kitten.
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
Takes one to know one! Pig!
You're a dirty pig!
Dirty pig!
Bitch!
Pig!
Cow!
Pig!
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
Be ready to leave in two days' time. Same place as last night.
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.
Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
Stop it, Wladek.
God forbid!
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
Out of Warsaw.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
I've been worried sick.
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.
Doesn't matter. You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often.
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
Not yet.
We're getting out.
The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
Show me.
Where are you hiding?
A pianist.
What's your work?
Where do you live?
What the hell are you doing?
... without a shred of manners.
We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.
Ohh no, it makes my skin creep!
Yes, like a cave.
Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave.
Oh yes, dear too - TERRIBLE! AWFUL!"'
To be deaf?
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
It will be very dramatic.
Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done.  You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea!
Watch his hand
Careful! Watch his hand.
Watch your feet!
Watch your feet!
Well he has NOTHING to pack, but he is leaving. And it is just as well; Nessie has foolishly grown an affection for him ... we have had some tears
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
That is good, yes.
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
Oh indeed. Cotton'.
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
Well, she was very violent with the gown. She tore off a chunk of lace. if hadn't been there I'd have sworn she'd used her teeth
No sound at all?
Like it were a piano?
Yes, it's unholy.
Well, that is a strong opinion.
Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would be.
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.
Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys
Ohhh I've never been there.
The Alps.
Which mountains are those dear?
And where did they get married?
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
.... They met when my mother was an opera singer... in Luxemburg...
Ohh the tag is broken.
My REAL father was a famous German composer
I miss you.
I worry for you.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
You have spare wife here Peini. You get rnana for that. Our chief four wives.
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
She says, throw the piano overboard.
He chopped it off
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!
Everyone has to practice.
She wants to see what you can do.
Wash them again.
You have to wash them.
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
Mama.
Do I know any gigs?
What will I play?
He's given it to us.
Tomorrow.
She never gives him a turn.
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
What on?
Hello.
We can't leave the piano
She wants it to come.
It must come.
It's my mother's piano.
I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall.
What are ya gonna do, call the cops?
Right through there.  But I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
Which way are the rooms?
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
All right if I look around your lobby?
Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought he mighta come in here.
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
That's right.
You the owner here?
At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third.  Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good.
Yeh, go ahead.
Billie.  You ready?
Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in today.
He'll probably fall down.
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
What's the line on Visitation?
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.
Hell no, I just cut into him.  I woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
You got a bag or somethin?
If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
What makes you think you can trust him?  He didn't do shit.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
You wanted by the law or somethin'?
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened?  He get ya with the knife?
Don't worry about it, pal.
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're gonna run through the route tonight.
Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans. Fiskin and the Boone Kid from Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and Limehouse Chappie from New York. Those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from.
No.  Never saw him before.  He's a dick, though.
Twist, you know this guy?
Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store.  I need a twenty man boost right away.
Coupla days ago.  I'm workin' a big one with Gondorff on the North Side.
Twist!  When did you get back in town?
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
We'll be waitin'.
I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.
They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16.5 is Gary, and 20 in Cicero.  Looks like you're bringing up the rear, Granger.
Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
We cleared 22 here.
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
Shove off, Duff.
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
He was a con man, wasn't he?
Wasn't no problem a mine.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
Buck Duff.  I was in Maxwell's boost in Troy.
Listen to me, Hooker.  What ever you do, don't go back to your place tonight, don't go anyplace you usually go, ya hear me?  Get outa town or somethin', but...
What the hell you gonna do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan?  You're committin' suicide, kid.
I thought you blew all your money.
Forget it.
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
All he's gotta do is read.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.
Got to.  Gondorff's ridin' the mark in from New York on the Century.
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
He wants to put a half million on Syphon.
Looks like he's sulking.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
The wire is ten years outa date.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.
Look at that.  He's got four apes with him.
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
You in?
I'm not sure I know it.
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I put the finger on ya.
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.
But what about all these other people?
But I got a train to make.
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
Okay, Tootsie.
All right, when?
No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
You sure you wanna start off that big?  Bet like that could put a real dent in us.
You gonna have a go here?  How 'bout a ten spot on the line here.  The 4-9 been lookin' good today.  Lotsa action on 28th Street down there, too.  Pay ya 10-1.
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
Hooker!
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
Like hell.  You won't even get a review till you're seventy.  And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later.
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion.  Counterfeiting, anything you want.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
You want a drink or something?
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
Can't do it.  There're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get somebody else to do our betting.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
We missed him.
Never heard of the place.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
For fifteen years.
We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?
I think he will.
He'll never do it.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
Do ya know him or don't ya?
Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
What is this?  I got work to do.
We'll see you before you go.
What's your next step, Nick?
What about this Rosebreen?
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
Come on, gimme a break.
Of course.
Is that what it means?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
You know how they are... sex...
Why not?
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
Yes.  He admitted it.
He was?
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
Any luck?
Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
Cheer up, darling.
Oh.  I'll do my own typing!
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
Nothing.
Do you suppose.....  ?
Why did that man want to kill him?
She's got me worrying, too.
Mind if I look around?
That is, if it's all right with you.
It's the same one.
How are you?
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
You're high enough.
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
You're talking like a crazy person,
Dorothy!
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
Do you think I care
What are you talking about?
Go!
You've got to get your mind off this.
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
Don't cry.
What do you mean?
Tch-tch-tch --  Well, goodbye, Miss Wynant.  You wouldn't drive slowly, so you don't get a tip.
Did he tell you where he was going?
Is your father still in there?
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
Not at all.
Yes.
You can take that out to the car.
know.  But I saw him -
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
Did you kill her?
Was there much blood?
Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
She could tell you where father is.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
I didn't know they had a fight.
I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....
Yes.  But he didn't show up.
About three.
I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
He telephoned me today.
Well....
I said he hadn't written me.
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
Just give me a minute....  I'll remember. I'm not stalling, Lieutenant.  You know I always come clean with you.  Gee, it'd serve me right if you had pinched me...  that's the afternoon I was.... wait, I'll show you...!
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!
You don't think I had anything to do with it?
I didn't mean you, Mister.
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth.  Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth.  All right.  Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.
Have a shot?
Never mind.
I thought you said you weren't going there.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
Just what I said I'd do.
I said all right!
All right.  All right.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
You've said that for weeks.
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
I got word from Wynant this morning...
That's all right.
Good.
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
Yes?
But what if you need more money?
Is Julia going with you?
What'll I do if something comes up?
Well, let me do that for you.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
But suppose some business comes up...
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
I have no right to answer that.
But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.
Hello....  Where?  In Allentown.  Yes... When is the next train? Right - I'll get that.  Wynant's tried to commit suicide. They want me to come down and identify him.  I guess this changes the whole story, doesn't it?  That looks like an admission of guilt.  And I had such hopes.  I thought if you got on the case, you'd be able to clear him.  I thought that Mimi.... the way she acted... I was sure that....  Oh, well, well... it's no use thinking of it now.  I'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time.
I've done that already. He should appear, you know.  It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money...  I give it to her and she gives it to him.
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
I see.  I see.
You don't say --
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
How are you?
That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
No... no.
Police!
Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
No, Mr. Charles.
I wouldn't know.  That time he caught me was a accident.  I led with my right.
He's a good guy.  He sent me up the river once.  Hey, Nick!
You his wife?
Nick Charles here?
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
Bonds, sir?
Well, congratulations.
You did.
I'm fired.
Home!
I just wanted to tell you...
I'm sorry...  but...
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Baghdad.
Y-yes.
They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
No, Tetanty.
Vocasity
4000 degrees is usually the point of....?
No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.
Control ON.
Too low.
4732...?
Hurry up.
See if you can get a reading on tactal retention.  Try to estimate it without a meter reading.
What happened?
HUMMMM.....
Correct.
Permant cortex bond.
A sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....?
Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.

I can't hear him.
It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
There goes another of your disciples.
A shelldweller.  They live in the outer shell of the city.  Quite unique, there have been two here before.  They smell.
Good Lord!
What?
But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge.  Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity.
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
I've said many times before, and I guess I'll have to repeat it again for your...
Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away?  Economically, it's not sound at all.  Very much unlike....
But you can't.  We must escape.
Who?  Who's leaving?
What?
What's going on....what are you doing?
We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  You can work with us.  An organized plan of escape must be devised first.  Could you see anything?  You want to leave.  You're not like them.  You must have left something, or someone.
Incredible!
We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...
It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
Impossible!
I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving.
No one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry.  This world is in a state of static-mobility:  we are at the same time moving and standing still.
What?
I've got it!  Astounding!
On the contrary!  It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  We must continue the search.
Not very encouraging.
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
Well?
You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
How far did you go?  Was it cold?
No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.
I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.
You are engaged in an unauthorized procedure.  Check cybernetic manual F-45.  If you do no have an F-45, you are in violation.  This is a double A restricted precinct. Remain where you are.  Authorities will arrive shortly.
Yes...
Yes...
You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes
Yes.
No thanks, Bev.
Coffee, Mike?
Damn.
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
How's the print coming?
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
Hey, that's the guy-
Thanks.
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
-Where?
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
Officer Reilly, vice.
And you are...?
Where are they?
They're not here.
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
May I help you?
Hang on.
Just do it.
Aren't you on suspension?
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Go ahead.
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
How the hell do you feel yellow?
What... ?
Which one's which?
Yeah, another round thing.
Make up your mind, trigger.
What's wrong?
Something round, two wires ...
More metal... sharp edge...
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
Keep talking.
Nothing.
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
Talk to me. Let's assess.
What do we do?
Fuck factor?
Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
Me, too.
Would you?
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Where you guys at?
Be right back.
It's working.
I terrible with mechanical things.
I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
What?
Which one's which?
So cut both.
Why do you do it?
You guys seem pretty tight.
Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
`Til we get a better lead.
Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
Look, it's a longshot...
Yep.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
Cream of the crop, huh? You?
You mentioned something called Redstone.
I don't know. You tell me?
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
Oh yeah? Prove it.
Hey, look--
Where...?
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Anything else I should know?
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Mike Reilly.
Now wait just a fucking-
What?
What was-? Why...?
We've got one hour. Are you coming or not?
What're you talking about?
We can start in the area where the robbery occurred.
Thanks.
What do you mean?
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
You the Bomb Squad?
Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.
Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not.
You got it.
"Punks", huh?
Oh shit...
Whadaya mean?
Right.
What do you think?
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
Jesus...
We've created a monster.
What do ay say?
Lane oil...
Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
Glass, what is it?
Computer device?
Helluva fuck factor.
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
Hey, I'm next.
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
People are dying.
Then why tell me?
He's my brother...
Thank you.
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
Taylor's dead.
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
Who is he?
Cover.  It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.
Take him!
Drop it.
Shut up!  Who is this?
Alex, please-
What? Nobody, I-
Who are you calling, sis?
Stay in the truck.
Alex, please.
Stay here.
No... No more killing.
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
Why are we stopping here?
Nothing... just tired.
What's the matter?
Security.
What is that?
I know. I warned them.
Alex-
You okay?
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
You touch me again and--
A ticking bomb...
What the hell was that?
Maybe she knows your old man.
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
But sir--
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
I want to work this.
Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
I'm filing charges against that mother-
Reilly, what're you doing here?
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
What the hell's going on?
We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
What about the ballistics report?
Nothing so far.
Prints?
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.
How're you guys doing?
Insurance?
Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match
What kind of bomb was it?
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
Look, it's important.
He is!
Fuck factor ten.
Oh shit...
Shit. We're fucked.
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking?
Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here!
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
I don't know...
Pooch, can you move it?
That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
Vice... Jesus.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Ain't that a shit--
It don't work-
Take your time... one day at a time, kid...
Don't talk.
Mike...
Yeah, just a nick ...
You okay?
Nah, let's just take a look-see.
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
What was it this time?
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
No thanks. I got close but it never woulda worked.
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
You don't fish.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens...
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
Next week we work the park.
C'mon, it's a quiet night.
Look who's talking, old man.
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
That feeling won't last long.
Nice to be here.
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools.
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
So what're we looking for?
My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
T.J., what're you doing?
You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
IRA - instant retirement account.
A what?
Huh?
Device.
Captain assigned me to assist you.
Vice cop on a homicide?
What?
P.E.T.N ...
It's about this.
Make an appointment.
Quiet!
Reilly, Vice. I-
We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
Pull back. You're only an observer.
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
You've been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities. I'll need your badge and your weapon.
I know.
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
It's our only option.
I promised her she'd be safe.
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
I didn't. But I had to try.
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
Yes, sir.
But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
Yes, sir.
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
Report on the case so far.
What's this?
I thought I told you--
Sir...
Yes, sir.
I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
Goddamit, Reilly--
I'll do it.
It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
What?
I'll do it.
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-
Sir, I--
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
Captain...
No!  But let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!
Diamonds all over.
And diamonds in the front.
And it had diamonds in the back.
So you lost a handbag, madame?
Yes, M'sieu Laval!
M'sieu Giron is downstairs.
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.
M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.
He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
erect in sweater, arms folded.
still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
<u>Tonsili!</u>
About tonsils.
What did you talk about?
That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So we talked for about ten minutes.
<u>Niente!</u>
No!
The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.
I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
Well, he knocked at the door. You see, I was expecting two--uh--two business associates.
Why did you let this man in, M'sieu Filiba?
I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
And harems ... ?
But--
Yes!
No!
No.
No.
No.
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
You see--  No, no! And <u>yet</u>--  <u>Did</u> I--did--now <u>where</u> could we have--
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
Doc--!
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Just dull.
He's really not a bad fellow.
I thought so.
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
Smart. London, eh?
Like it?
Nice suit.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
The type they marry.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
Now see here, my good man. I've had just about enough of your insulting remarks!
You're looking fine, Major.
Umm.
Nice day, Major.
Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.
Good morning, Major.
Yes, Baron. Thank you.
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
Yes, Baron?
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.
I would start with cocktails.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
No, Captain, I tell you--
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
Good day, Doctor.
Just as you say, Doctor.
Well, the evening is still young. Let's go down to the living room and talk it over.  It's only ten o'clock.
Yes, madame!
No, m'sieu!
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
I wanted to ask her to ask you if you'd be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight.
What is it, madame?
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
Yes--uh--
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Yes, Madame Colet?
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
Yes, I saw it--but--
No--I'm sorry.
Didn't you take it with you?
Your bag?
Well, he was in the navy.
Because I hate him--because I love you!
That's true.
He started it.
An hour, two at most.
How much time?
The pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder.
The pumps --
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
That's right.
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
Good luck to you, Rose.
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
Hurry, Rose.
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
The ship will sink.
About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
Thank you, Rose.
It's hers, you schmuck.  Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.
Rush her.
Don't drop it Rose.
Holy shit.
Lewis...
So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!
Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the 20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is dead.
A hundred and one next month.
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
Get that outta my face.
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
Shit.
You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
Who's the best? Say it.
I'm tryin' boss.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are.
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
What?
Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory.  You see this? Right here?
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
Don't you mean work me?
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
I told you you wanted to take this call.
...Mrs. Calvert?
Rose Calvert.
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
No, trust me, you want to take this call.
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
There's a satellite call for you.
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
The partners want to know how it's going?
What could possible be funny?
There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
So do I.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
She's not on the starboard side either.
None of the stewards have seen her.
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
You know I don't like that, Rose.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
The boats are all going.
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
You know somebody?
You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!!  Capito?? I go to America!!
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
Well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, I'd rather not, if it's all the same.
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
Cor... look at that, would ya.
Well I can.
Bollocks.
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.
Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go.  Well come on!
They'll pull us right down I tell ya!
No! It's our lives now, not theirs. And I'm in charge of this boat! Now row!!
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
Excuse me.
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
We've struck ice.
Why have we stopped?
Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all.  Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
No, but we're making excellent time.
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
Yes sir.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
I'm sorry.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
You think she was really there?
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
That's enough.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
April 14, 1912.
You had it the entire time?!
Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?
Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
Just tell us what you can --
Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship.  See the date?
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.
Would you like anything?
Is your stateroom alright?
Rose, get in the boat!
Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.
Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?
I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.
Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play.
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
Charmed, I'm sure.
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
No-o!
Did you find it?
You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
Will you pardon me?
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
Lumber, ma'am--spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance--  --and now gosh darn it--"Honest Jack"--that's what they call me--is goin' to see the world.
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
Guess again, copper.
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
That goes two ways.
I thought you were a sucker--
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
How's your mother feeling?
It's your deal.
That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.
Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
Come in!
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
About twelve hundred.
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff.
The country boy's about due.
They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds.
That's him! That's the sucker!!
There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
Eh?... Oh.
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
Because I was yellow, I guess--
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
No!
Yes, Yes!
What's the matter?
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
He's certainly good-natured.
Thirty one's and two ten's?
There you are, sir.
If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
What!--are you crazy?
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
Sure, Sis.
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
Then why did you run away?
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Hey--you! Where you going?
Let me look at it.
Well--get a move on yer--then get back to yer station.
Everything in order, sir?  What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?
Oh, my God...
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'.
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
God damn son of a...
Oh, for Christ's sake!
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.  In or out?
That's not what I meant.
What d'you think of the singer?
Actually, you know, that's not a Bad idea, send a signal we're Growing up.
So how's Tombstone treating you?
Well I'm the man to see.  Besides Sheriff I'm also tax collector, Captain of the Fire Brigade, and Chairman of the Non-partisan Anti- Chinese league.  A man of many Parts.  Got a place to stay yet?  I Also sit on the Townlot Commission.  Got a couple of Lovely cottages coming up for Rent.  Here, let me show you...
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
You will after tonight.  Bet on it.
Easy.  I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here.  Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  None of 'em.
You whore!  You filthy whore!
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
Listen, I want to talk to you.
I saw that look on your face just now. What's between you and Wyatt?
Well I guess you can see, never a Dull moment.  Maybe you should Stay around to see what happens Next.  Who know?  You might find a Future here.
Yes, very.  And very married.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
Come and get him.
Where do you think?  I stole him.
Beauty, ain't he?
He said to turn loose of him.
Oh, Jesus, Johnny...
Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died.
Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!
Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!
I want them spitting blood!
And you must be Doc Holliday.
Shut up, Ike.
Well now that's a little more Like it.
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us?  Didn't make No sense.
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard...
Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get Some, boy!
Well... 'bye.
I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.
We're gonna get along just fine.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
Good.  That's real good.
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
But wait, you don't understand-
Excuse me?
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.
I was kidding about that.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
Here it come: one-two-
All right, lunger.  Have at it.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
Age quod agis.
Yeah, you look it.
You retired, too?
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
That's good.  I knew it wasn't nothin'.
How you feeling, Doc?
What's wrong, Doc?
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
You don't even know him.
I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
Here, Doc.
A which?
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".
What?  But I saw 'em-
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
You really look awful.
Sorry...
Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.
Damn!  All right, wait a minute...
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
All right, I'm on fire!  Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go!
Colorado's closer
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
Wyatt, are you crazy?
Good God, you're really-
What?
Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if He's gonna make it.
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!
It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-
I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.
Praise Jesus!
He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.
Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.  You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.
Never even heard of anything like it.
Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before?
How is he?
Yeah, better run, you bastards!
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
You know, we might just pull this off.
Yeah.  Or undertakers.
There they go.  Look kinda like preachers.
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
Well sure, neighbor, easy to say.
You see that bird at the faro Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play.  Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
What can I get you?
You're the boss.  One thing, though.
'Least they don't scare women.
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
Forget it, Ringo.
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
That what you got me up here for?
Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us.
You wanted to talk?
Well hello, Sherm.
Might as well hear him out. Anyways, what choice we got?  But no matter what happens, see It through to the end.  If you don't I'll curse the day I ever laid eyes on you.
There they are.  No herd though.
Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.
What'd you do that for?
But this time they'll be ready.
Florentino!  He's getting away!
I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers.  Move!
Not anymore, not after this.
No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin' I say'll fix things but I want You to know it wasn't me.
There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher.
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
Well in that case, I saw your Horse.  Billy Clanton was takin' Him up to the Cut to show him Off.  The boys're all up there Right now, branding.  And in a Mood.  Still want your property Back, Mr. Private Citizen?
Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.
Run for your lives, boys!  It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas!
Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-
Well I'm real scared.
That a fact?
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
That a fact?
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
Doc's just in no kinda shape.
Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?
500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that.
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
See what I mean about it getting Spooky?
Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
It's too late -
Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
But -
What do they say in Russia, General Bukharin?
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
I expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours. Until then, I'm imposing my own electronic silence: For the sake of the economy, not a word to NATO, the press, the CIA.  ...And so long as Commander Bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters, I want him to go along as an observer. Are we agreed?
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
And I have the entire British economy to worry about.
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
Admiral, are you suggesting -
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
Him? He, is a she -  at the bar.
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
Not all of us, 007.
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
Ah, James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
Four o'clock. M will meet you in the conference room.
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
Standard equipment. The world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders.
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
Your new car.
I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
Just - say it. Say it just once.
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Just hold me.
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
Do you feel better now?
No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
Oh, James. I've missed you -
Is that any way to say hello?
To the best of my recollection, Mr. Bond, I suggested no such thing.  In fact, I was never here.
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
Need I remind the two of you that Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway - is directly descended from the Earl of Aberdeen? That his Scottish ancestors practically invented Hong Kong - and out of sheer gratitude, Queen Victoria herself named the port "Aberdeen Harbor" in their honor?
More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
His newspapers?
I believe Q's exact words were:  "Hopefully, nothing."
Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last thing: Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective device.
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
Not from forty feet.
Big game fishing.  Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift from his friends at the CIA.
Gone fishing.
Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
Well... If you insist.
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
You too.
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
I didn't think so.
Three. You? Married?
Happily.
... Does this do anything?
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
Interesting video tape.
Sabotage?
What do you make of all this?
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
Good luck on your mission, 007.
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
Yes. 1988. He was furious at the British plan to return Hong Kong, and supposedly started his own negotiations with the Chinese Government. The inquiry went nowhere - but it did earn MI-6 a rather powerful enemy -
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
It seems, 007, we've received a tip
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
Mandarin. You jerk.  I'm late. I have to get dressed.
Sakwa!
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Stop it!
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
You leave me no alternative.
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
Captain Morton.
Who's Wade?
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
Who's in charge here?
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
The Queen invited you to dinner -
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
Chew up a log like that in the propeller, you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to London. Twice.
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!
Seems to be back to normal, sir.
How is it now?
Check it again. What about the global positioning satellite? Could there be something wrong with the signal?
The back-up does the same thing.
About every ninety seconds, the auto- pilot jogs us to the west.
What's wrong?
Damn. It's doing it again.
Take the men. I can finish alone.
You have to leave -
Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
Approaching the first gate.
The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.
That was too close.
It's Bond!
Yes. Shall we kill them?
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
It's a trick! After him.  They're in the south stairwell!
Fueled and waiting.
Thank you sir! Thank you!
Please sir. Please -
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
Yes, sir. But he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division. He has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment.
I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
Yes.
Will the cruise set it off?
Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
Abort the cruise.
Maybe. Maybe not.
Will it go off?
What's in the box, General?  What's in the box???
I don't know. He's not in the database -
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Who is it?
Oh, no.
One to seven: Deal the face cards.
What about ID's?
What is it, noontime?
We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad.
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
I ought to break your damn neck.
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
I'm not here to argue, sir.
Well, you just have to move further out.
Not anymore, not in the city.
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
I don't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
That's nice.
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
Is this your house?
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
None of your business.
My mother passed on years ago.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.
No, I'm a different person now, Harry.
I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
Harry always shows his good side and, like the moon, the other side is black. Back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman. I'm telling you Harry is nothing but evil. I'm warning you -- you can't keep a wild animal as a pet around children.
You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
Where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends? They all smell of moth balls.
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out welcome.
Don't shout!
When did you talk to Harry?
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
You know the man next door is near death.
I'm sorry he got those birds.
He is in his pigeon cage.
Where is Skip?
I was just trying to make conversation.
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
What are you doing?
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
Mm-hmmmmm.
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
Rocky!  The ramp!
What are you doing over there?
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
Something's screwy here.
Everyone, it's Woody!
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
What's with him?
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Murderer!
Oh, that is disgusting.
He's in the psycho's bedroom!
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
How 'bout three out of five?
No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
Are you peeking?
Heh-heh.
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
Miss.  G-6.
B-3.
I got dibs on his hat!
Let's string him up by his pull- string!
Sorry there, old Spudhead.
Hey, watch it!
I can't see a thing!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
MOM!!  MOM!!
Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
No she's NOT --
She's sick!
Hey!!
Look!  Janie!
What?
Oh no, Hannah!
I don't know!
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
I dunno.
Did I get my package in the mail?
What?
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
Will you quit moving around?!
Aa-a-a-a-ah!
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
That ain't no happy child.
Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.
Have you been replaced?
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
Oh, no!
Toss 'im overboard!
Come on.  Let's get out of here.
Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
You murdering dog!
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
You are a liar!
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Who is it this time?
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
Laser-envy.
A lunchbox...?!
Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
ROOAAAARR!!!
He got it, Woody!
I got it, Woody!
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
I thought he was at summer camp!
It's Sid!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
What the heck is up there?
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
They're getting bigger.
I can't quite make out --
Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
It's a big one...It's a...it's a boardgame!  Repeat!  Battleship -- Battleship, the boardgame!
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Come in, Mother Bird. Alright...Andy's opening the first present now.
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
Yes SIR!
Sir!  No Sir!
W-w-w-we?
It's busted.
What?!
Huh?
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!

Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
I can't hold on much longer!
Woody!  Speed up!
See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
I knew you'd come back, Woody!
Woody?!
Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --
Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
Got it.
Bad news?!
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
I'm red this time.
Right here, Woody!
Juliet who?
We're too young.
Storms?
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
I wanted my Leda to be a little girl. Leda and the swan. See?
You're well built; how old are you?
What? Did you let that child play with one of my toys? I don't like children playing with my toys.  Have to fix you up with another hammer, won't we. Give her a saucepan to play with, that'll do.
Did you do this?
You're late for breakfast.
Well, I hope it stays that way.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
I mean, did you ask her?  What kind of drugs has she tried?
One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
You will believe me, because it's true.
I want to believe you.  I really do.
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.
Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
What is he planning on telling them?
Nine thousand dollars.
How much?
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
Why does he need money?
It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
What?  What is it?
No.
He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
He's not here.
I can't find Manolo.
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
Goodbye Arnie.
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
So my wife is lying?
You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
Don't bother.
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
He's a friend.  He's also like the only one who was dealing with the situation.  He'd definitely had a few beers, but it's not like he wanted to drive.  We didn't know what else to do.  It wasn't my pot.
He didn't hang around us.  He's like one of those hippie kids.  I'm not part of that group.  It was a party in all these rooms.  His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do?  I mean, what would you have done if you had been us?
Is this bad for him?
Are you going to?
Did you tell Dad?
Sorry, but I mean, come on.
None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
Did you meet the President?
Helena --
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --
Helena --
How's David?
You all right?
I got that.  How was your day?
What's up?
Hi.
You can't make me.
Like I give a fuck.
Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
How long's the job?
Will we get invited to the White House?
What if every country legalized at the same time?
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
You do?  What else you do?
I get A's.  All A's.
What's that mean?
I'm third in my class.
How are your grades?
Yeah.
Private?
Cincinnati Country Day.
In school?
I volunteer.  I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.
Do you work?
Yes.
Parents still together?
Yes.
Live with your parents?
Sixteen
...How old are you?
Why?  Nobody's there.
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
Then here's a little bump.
Yes, mom --
Have you done your homework, honey?
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --
He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --
We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us.
Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --
Not like.  It is.
What is this, like freebase?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
Just watch.
What are you doing?
Arizona.
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
What do you think it is?
Yeah!
We're playing!
Not Tiger Woods.
No --
They're going to walk right past me.
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
You may speak.
Yes.
You only got to me because you were tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, who's trying to break into Tijuana. You're helping them.  You work for a drug dealer too, Monty.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
Can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened?  That my drugs had gone through.  What would have been the harm?  A few people get high who are getting high anyway. Your partner is still alive.  We avoid having breakfast together. Don't you see this means nothing? That your whole life is pointless?
You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
This is ridiculous.  Why is there no elevator?
Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
In Mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity, this is not so true for the USA.  Using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border and calculated the odds of a search.  The odds are not high, and we found variables that reduce the odds.  We hire drivers with nothing to lose.  Then we throw a lot of product at the problem.  Some get stopped.  Enough get through.  It's not difficult.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
So, it's worth the wait, right? What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have an airlift?  It's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right?  How many peasants would that take?  A line stretching from here to Mexico City --
You will dine with me from now on.
I don't know, sir.
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
Yes, sir!
We aren't barbarians.
Yes, sir!
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.
Exactly, and this is how I know I'm not getting into business with the U.S. Government.
Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
Perhaps... Perhaps... I'm afraid I must first ask you to pass a test. I asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors.
That's good coke.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
You first.
I don't believe you.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
I don't know.  Perhaps I remember something.
But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
We keep our mouths shut.
Javi!  Come on.  Don't pull this you don't care bullshit.  This is incredible information.  It must be. Javi --
Porfirio Madrigal is not dead.  I just saw him.
What?
Madrigal's alive.
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
It's no problem.  I was just with everybody we work with.
Not this time.
Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come?
Your new friends.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Who?
A group of us are going out tonight.
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
The police won't find your car.
Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.
Anyway, I don't think we'll ever see them again.  Everything's back to normal.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
I don't know.  Something.
What's he doing up here?
Yeah.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
I feel like a traitor.
You should feel good about this.
This is a very different proposition.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
We agree.
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
No.
A place we have, that we know is protected.
Where?
Somewhere safe.
When he loves me like a father, he will never tell anyone he was here. He will freely give the names of his superiors.  Then we get them and they too will give us names.  And eventually somebody will get us to Juan Obregon and the cartel will fall.
But will he be house-trained?
You watch and learn.  I earn his trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear with kindness.  Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.
Everybody has a weakness.
I'm curious how you did this with such economy.
He'll do what I say.
Only if he can be trusted.
Does this offer include my partner?
A small thing.  Nothing really.
What is it you want me to do?
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
If I can.
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?
It was an anonymous tip.
What is the name of your informant?
An informant.
One question.  How did you find about this?
Well, Javier Rodriguez, you've done a very good job, but we'll take care of it from here.
Javier Rodriguez.
What's your name?
It's possible.
It could mean that, yes.
I'm aware of that.
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
My work keeps me young.
Right.  But, that's not the biggest problem.  One of our Intel officers picked up information from DEA that traffickers have come up with a process, a chemical process, to turn coke into something else.  It doesn't smell like coke.  It doesn't look like coke.  And what's worse, it doesn't react to field test.  It could be anything.  Maybe it's already happening.  I mean, how would we know?
Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers.  At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
I got money.
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
Hey man, back the fuck up.  To this place.  What's that shit?  Right now, all over this country, a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see, You got any drugs?  You know where I can get drugs?  What kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person, on their possibilities?  If you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood, Indian Hills, and they asked every white person they saw, hey, you got any drugs?, within a day, your friends and their kids would be selling. It's market forces, man.  The product's marked up three hundred percent.  You can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day.  You think white people would still be going to law school?
I don't know, maybe we missed her.
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
We sometimes went downtown to score.
You won't say anything to my parents?
I don't know what to say.
I tried to talk to her when she was up there, but they wouldn't put me through.  I'm surprised she hasn't called.
Oh, man --
She's not at that place you sent her?
Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
Yes, I hope so as well.
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
That would be very helpful to me.  Also, I received the offer from DEA and the FBI to train some of my men at Quantico.  I think this will be extremely useful, a good way for us to absorb some of your methods.
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.
If we're moving the press conference, we need to do it now.  Are you all right?
Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.
Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating.  Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for.
I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.  I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you.
I don't know.  I don't think there's any one person.  See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides.  Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels.  It's very organized.
What do you mean?
Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows?  Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
Agents who died in the field.
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
What kind of research?
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.
You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back --
OK. Same again?
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
Bit fucking late, like.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
No. On you go.
You were in my way.
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
Shag her senseless.
If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
Sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
For fuck's sake.
Ninteen.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Twenty thousand.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
I'd fucking kill you.
For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
Did you bring the cards?
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement.
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.
I'm a fugitive from the law. I can't be seen on the fucking streets. Now watch my lips. Kempton Park. Two-thirty. Five pounds to win. Bad Boy.
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
I've no fucking cigarettes.
Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.
And remember, Rents: no skag.
He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
What happened?
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
It's an interesting theory.
I read it in Cosmopolitan.
Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone full-blown.
Returned it? Where? To the video shop, Tommy? To the fucking video store? So every punter in Edinburgh is jerking off to our video? God, Tommy, I feel sick.
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
Tommy, let's put the tape on.
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Do you recall the school motto?
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.
Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
Spud, they're my sheets.
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
There's no need.
I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.
Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
Homeless people?
What do you see as your main strengths?
My pain?
Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
He doubts me.
You doubt me?
Then I shall make use of this starship.
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
And how did you breach the Barrier?
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
Don't worry, fellas. Your secret's` safe with me. I'll send the shuttlecraft to pick you up.
Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
Is there a problem, gentlemen?
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
Return to prearranged coordinates for pickup.
Rescued at last.
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
In firing position. Torpedo armed.
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
Following new course. Warp seven.
Pavel.
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
Plotting our new course.
Sulu, what are you doing?
And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time.
Admit it. We're lost.
I don't have a clue.
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
DO it. Go to Red Alert.
But the shuttle-
Raise shields.
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
Closing.
Position, Bird of Prey?
Shuttle en route.
I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
We will be happy to beam down. But first we must have certain assurances.
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
No, but you can bet they will.
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.
But how?
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
What is it you seek?
Join my quest.
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
The power was within you.
Where did you get this power?
Let us explore it together.
What do you know of my pain?
Your pain runs deep.
It's all I have.
Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.
She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
ER... You forgot to take it with you.
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.

















Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.
No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.
No. Sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we've always been afraid to express.
He's not?
Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
Borgus Frat.
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
Oh, that is beautiful. You've got the goods...
Your old files -- ?
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
Uh... got any cinnamon?
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
Hi, Flynn.
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
Dillinger?
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Senior exec.
You invented Space Paranoids?
I don't get it.
Are you embezzling?
You did break in.
I'm certainly not.
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
Flynn!
What -- ?
For being on to Dillinger.
For what?
That Dillinger's on to him.
Of what?
To warn him.
What for?
I mean I want both of us to go.
You call that getting over it?
I want to go to his place.
Okay, okay...
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
Flynn had Group 7 access.
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
Did he say why?
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
Did you say Group 7 access?
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
How's it going upstairs?
Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.
They'll start to soon enough.
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
Yes...but you have to go roundtrip, and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance. Hah!
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.
Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
Hello, Alan.
Beautiful!
Ok
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
Yeah...?
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
Yes!
You said it.
Not a chance.
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
Yes, okay, exactement!
Right on the money!
No...
For sure...
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program out of the system. And get me those Chinese language program I asked for.
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
End of line.
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.
That was uncalled-for.
Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...
User requests are what computers are for.
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
Who is your User, program?
When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
Hah.
Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
Hmm. A difficult proposition... difficult proposition at best.  Perhaps you've noticed... we're not exactly packing them in these days ...
Yes?
Flynn... you can't... I
But... won't you be de-rezzed?
Why? What are you going to do?
Flynn, we've got to help him!
Almost... I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments ...
How did you do that, Flynn?
It's too far!
The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all.
A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
A User -- in our world?
Little more juice's all it needs...
Come here.
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
Alan-One...
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
Recognizers!
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really...
How 'bout yourself?
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
You're getting out of the business?
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here...
Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.
You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
We have to talk.
I don't have time, Sark. And neither do you. End of line.
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
End of line.
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
Wait...I need that...
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
But-what if I can't...?
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
A User?
He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
Yes, MCP.
Strategic Air Command.
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
Thank. you, Master Control.
Do you know what he's talking about?
You think we can make it there?
What do you think?
The Users...you really think they're still there?
New guy...
It's something Users do.
I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
Then I owe you some thanks...
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
You've grown, big program.
It's a flat. But wait a micro...
My quarters.
How?
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
Helen!  It's your mystery man.
Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
I'm shocked.
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
I have a book report.
I'm done.
Where are you going?
It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows we exist.
Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?
Unbelievable!  Trent told me he wrote it.  He's history.
Dad, how come you know the words?
Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
Yeah, right.
Fine.
I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
Okay, Dad.
Yeah, Dad.
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
Roger, One.  Rolling.
And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the					* ghost numbers.  They were checking out the Renquist front.
She lives in Rome, but she does stuff here the Smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections, so she has offices				* here.										*
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
And this is a little above market-				* rate for the horizontal bop, even				* for a total biscuit like her.
This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
Why?
They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
Yes.
Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
Yes sir.
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
Sure.  Say that now.
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
You think I care about their					* cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.					* See, America is on top now .  .				* .  but so was Rome, once.  All					* civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living					* well takes money.							*
Not exactly.
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
Hello, Harry.
Yes what?
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.
Do you like my tomb?  The museum				* financing fell out, so I thought				* your clients might be interested.
Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
I agree.
Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
Boris and Doris?
Get going!
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
Like one?
Hold that thought.
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
So now it's Tasker?  Not Renquist?
Who's your little friend?
His wife?  Good.  Bring them.
His wife.
Who is this woman?
Use the gifts that Allah has given you.
How?
Find out who this Renquist it.
What do you want me to do?
No.  He checked out okay--
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
It's a good thing you pay me well.
In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun.
I'm hip.
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
Heard that.
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
I heard that.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Take that shit somewhere else.
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
Naw naw!
So you do eat pussy!
Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit.
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
Fuck you! My mother was Apache.
No thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down here? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to be eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly where your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to myself, "This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the world. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, watch my TV." See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out, and you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I know I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.
Well. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in.
Who the fuck are you?
Where the fuck is that bitch?
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
Who's Sonny Chiba?
What are we gonna see?
How 'bout me what?
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
I'd fuck Elvis.
I can see what you mean.
That good, huh?
No. Not yet.
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
Come again?
Uh-huh.
Sure.
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
McTeague.
Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
What about him?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Could we try it now?
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
That was very good.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
Step inside.
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
He'll wear a wire?
Do you believe him?
That was a good fuckin' movie.
That Vietnam movie?
Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?
Look in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there lately.
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
Shit, man, you done fucked up again. Next time you bogart your way into a nigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day.
Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.
You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be crazy.  I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.  He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
Pussy love pink rocks.
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.
You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They got that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you. They give you hips, lips, and fingertips.
Rock whores.
What was I sayin'?
With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please.
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?
I tell Jayne Kennedy, "Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!"
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
Then, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat. And because you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for every nigger in the world everywhere.
- Because it's good!
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -
Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
Preach on, Big D.
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
That's bullshit.
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
Read my lips.
No.
I'm not wearing a bra.
No way, Jos.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
What can I do?
You're right. It is.
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
How do you know? You been there?
Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
Exactly room-mates.
Sorta room-mates?
Yeah, I live here.
Do you live here?
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
Well, you go down Beechwood...
Where's that?
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Do you know where we can find him?
Yes.
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
No.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
Yes.
Donowitz, he said.
What was the Jew-boy's name?
Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth before you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy.
I didn't mean -
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
No.
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?
We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.
You said we weren't "real," Cole...
The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become "addicted" have you, Cole?  To that "dying" world'
Women will want to get to know you...
Him?  You saw that man?
Well?
We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
Wake up, Cole.
We want you to tell us about last night.
This is it, James...what you've been working for.
We're very close!  Because of you!
You're still a little... disoriented.
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
For a man in your position...an opportunity.
We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
To be determined by the proper authorities.
Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!
What's she doing?
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
What are you going to do with us?
That's him.
Shut up!
I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
So that...???
And your only goal is...???
Meaning...???
And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
It's important to observe everything.
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
Hey, man...
Hey, five minutes ago, thirty years ago! Yes, that phone call.  I been in training for this a couple a months now -- ever since I got back from that... "weird" war we were in.  You remember that?  Here, take it, man!  You could still be a hero if you'd cooperate!
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!
Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts!  Here, take this.
Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
But you know what's real now?
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole.  Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him murder someone.  You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too.  You were under tremendous emotional stress.
Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.  Isn't she being defensive, Bob?
Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
You're insane, Jeffrey.
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
Then how come she knows what's going on?
That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?
Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
I'll be right here...just in case.
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
You want to go in?  Examine him?
Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.
Negative for drugs.  But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?
-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff.  All they got was his name.  They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him...
Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
Might be tight.
That's my morning's pay.
Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
You want to make a kiddies bet?
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
Put your money where your chicken- lipped mouth is.  I'll bet this mornings pay I'm right.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
No it won't.  You just don't know shit about statistics.
It will.
A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
It is not.
It's nonsense.
You got two years on me.  What's that make me?
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
Will be.
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
Hundred and eight already.
One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.
I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please.
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
The ticket is thirty dollars.
Thirty even.
One way, or round trip?
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
Where in Mexico would you like--
But, in particular?
Where to?
Can I help you, sir?
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
We ain't got no Beck's.
What would a truck stop be without beer?
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?
It'd serve you right.  Jose, run get a mop and clean this mess up.
Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
Let me get your change.
Lord!  Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
I said come on!
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of.
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to ask you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?
I asked you a question.
I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
Now, what's this?
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over.  Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Mister!
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Stand up.
Not before I settle with you.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
Mister, I'm calling you out.
You expect me to believe that?
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.
And John, don't make me come look for you.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
A hundred and . . . Now you listen to me you deadbeat, little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and I want it.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
You're the gambler.  You tell me.
The old lady?
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
That's a shame, John.  A real shame.
John, what a surprise.  I expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.
Senor, you need a doctor.
But, Senor--
I call the policia.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
Eh?
I call the sheriff.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
Eh?
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today.  You're not planning on staying are you?
Get in.
Where ya goin'?
Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
What'd you say to me!
A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Which you don't have.
The old lady?
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
"Arkady"
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
Keep your change.  Bus three-twenty-three. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.
The ticket is 30.55.
30.55. Twenty more will get you back.
One way, or round trip?
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
But, in particular?
Where to?
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25.  You try to have a nice day now, would you?
No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
What kind?
I think I burned my gun hand!
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
Son of a bitch!
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
Let me get your change.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
What was that all about?
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
This road don't go to Globe, Grace -- where were you going to meet me?
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.
Oh?
Well it's about time. Looks like you found yourself a helper too.
Morning Grace.
I want my lawyer!
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.
What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
What? You trying to bribe me, mister? Just cause you Russians ain't commies anymore, don't think money can buy everything...
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians?
Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.
Is that the entire message?
Proceed.
I had to put him down.
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
Yes?
I have a lock on the door.
I'll keep it in my office room.
What did I say?
Four.
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
Wrap it up.
Yes he is.
I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
Consider him packed. I didn't like his attitude... Struttin around with a cane and shit.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.
Is David Dunne there?
This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.
I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?
Is that right?
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
Did you get up from your seat?
Was your family traveling with you?
In the passenger car?
Where were you sitting on the train?
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
How are you feeling?
On a bench, across the street.
Well, go get it then.
Forget why. Do you want it or not?
...I got a present for you.
You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room.
No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
Like whores?
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?
But what they done, they...
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
All she done was... when she seen he had a teensy little pecker... she gave a giggle. That's all. She didn't know no better.
She's gonna live.  She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke.
Rain's coming.
We was... lyin'.
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow.
What wife? He don't have no wife.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
Ah, I see.
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
A wise policy. But if you did, I can assure you, the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand... in awe.  Whereas, a president... I mean, why not shoot a president?
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
Just wondered. Anybody could be scared.
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
Maybe he ain't so tough.
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
He didn't say nothin', huh?
Little Bill? He didn't say nothing. Like I said, he was buildin' his porch. Have you seen that thing?
What'd he say?
'Course he's coming.
He's coming ain't he?
Building his porch!
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
Nope.
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... an I says, "Skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this" an' I says, "Bill's sleepin', Skinny," an'...
Mmmm pistols.
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
Be careful with those, sonny.
Not really...  Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...  I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?
Books. He's my biographer.
WW Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett and... "friends."
What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
Shit and fried eggs.
Uh... a little, maybe.
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...
There's more.
A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +
Bear with me here...
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt;
+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;
He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;
No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
Come home, Dean.
Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?
I love you.
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
They just said they wanted time.
They want more time to think about investing.
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
You've come far. You're a good man. I love you.
Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.
A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something more creative?
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
I know who he is.
I don't know. This is bad.
Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
They fucking know everything.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
We all go. How about it, Keaton?
Then who goes?
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point.
You are a criminal.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
Can we stealth these guys?
Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.
What do you care what he says?
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?
If I'm going in, I want a stake.
Me too.
I can run. I got no problem with that.
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
You know damn well, dead-man.
This I had to see myself.
Ready?
How are you, Keaton?
Am I? 92 92    INT. HALLWAY - FIFTIETH FLOOR
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
I am sorry, Mr. McManus.  f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very                             + determined.
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
Mr. Soze will be most -
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
I work for Keyser Sate.
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
Get a grip. I didn't know.
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
Business or personal?
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
I've got a ton of work and no good people.
What?
Waste of time.
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
Which is shit.
Where?
He won't go into the interrogation room.
Two hours, tops.
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
No, no, no, no, no.
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
You're joking.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
Immunity.
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
Yes.
I'm fine.
Abrams...
As far as we know, nothing.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
Very good.
How good's your intelligence?
Nothing.
What did he find?
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
Yes.
I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
... tell me about this case.
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
Four cases in three years ...
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
He was accused of jury tampering.
What is the truth?
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
Yes.
We thought it was just.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
What does it mean?
Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
It looks that way.
Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth.  He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye.  You meet him at the hospital.'
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...
Mickey told me to come back to work.
Tell us.
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
Yes!
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
...We did everything we could...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
Yes.
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
Well, we...
And what did your team do...
That's right.
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
Tell me one?
Well, many reasons, actually...
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
We went to Code Blue...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr.Marx, of course...
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Thank you.  When Debby...
When she...
Anything special about the case?
Yes.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
Yes.
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
...I was one of a group of...
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
I was her doctor.
Say it.
Yes.
Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.
Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
Your Honor...!  Your Honor...
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Objection, we've...
Ed Concannon.
Objection.
I did.
Do you, indeed.  I'll bet you do. Fine.  Fine.  We'll save the court the time.  We will admit the Doctor as an `expert witness,' fine.
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
I'm on the staff of...
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
I am seventy-four years old.
How old are you?
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
...of Anesthesiology?
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
What book is that?
Through, through his book.
How is that?
I know of him.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I'm just an M.D.
Orthopedics?
No.
Neurology?
No.
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
Just as you are, Sir...
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
I'm going to uphold that.
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
You may step down.
No further questions.
I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
Nothing further, your Honor.
Mr. Concannon...?
My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price.  They wanted this cleared up in court.  They want their vindication.  I agree with them.  But for today the offer stands.  Before we begin the publicity of a trial.  For today only.    When I  walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
Huh!
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?
You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
You've just said you signed it.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
`They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?
You know these doctors could have settled out of court.  They wanted a trial.  They wanted to clear their names.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Just now...
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
You would not...?
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
You guys, you guys, you're all the same.  The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...'  And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did?  Do you know what you did?
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
What is this going to cost?
We just ...
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
... that's all right.
'Code Blue'...
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I...
I am on the staff of...
I am seventy-four years old.
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
I...um...
The Doctors were not negligent.
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
Well...
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
I didn't do too well for you.
It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
There's nothing they can do to me.
...What difference would...
...I made a reservation at...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
That's what I'd planned to...
It was good of you to meet...
Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Yes.
I.  Yes.  It is.
Yes.  I wrote it.
To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
... that's perfectly all right.
I understand.
Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.
Her doctors killed her.
Why?
You're going to settle out of court?
... and you're going to do that?
Right.  Who called?
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
I read the hospital report on your client.
That's perfectly all right.  I'm kind of rushed.  Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
Yes?  Galvin, right?
Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
I didn't do it, Mister.
And ask me what?
Nothing happened.
I've got nothing to say to you.
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
No.
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
Overruled...
Mr. Concannon...?
You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy.  We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end.  Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
Are you done?
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Listen to me, fella...
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out...They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case.  Now this is it today.
I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin.  Let's not waste these people's time.  Answer the question, Mr. Witness.  Please.  Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
I believe that's the law...is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Defense...?
Is the Plaintiff ready?
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
That happens.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
That's perfectly all right.
What is it?
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket.  You follow me?  I'm trying to help you.
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
Why is that?
No.  At Chelsea Childcare.  Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey?  I'm late for work.
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
Missus...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
Kathy Price.
Yes.  Price...
How come you're calling me from...?
From the magazine?
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
Mr. Galvin's...
I can't guarantee that...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
Continental Casualty...
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
He's not in, Sir.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
He saw her at the Northern Care...
... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
... You saw her?
But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
It's locked.
You saw Kat in New York...   ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
In New York?
She did?
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
That's for sure, Frank.
Yeah.
Thanks, Franky.
Another, Frank . . . ?
Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
Yes.
Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
As I've said we had some more...
We, we were rather busy...
Yes, the roving nurse...
Yes.
Yes, that's correct.
Yes.
Ah? That complicates the problem.
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
Did she hurt herself?
What happened?
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
What car?
In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...
And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask --
Oh, yes!
Is there something I can do for you?
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
She died.
By... no... the name I do not remember. A rich man, a powerful man.  It is not an unusual story. She came from somewhere small, to the south of the city... some say from a mission settlement... young, yes; very young.  And she was found singing and dancing in a cabaret by the man... wait... wait... Ives! His name was Ives!  Yes. And he took her and built for her this great house in the Western Addition... and there was a child. Yes. This was it. The child.
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
Well...
Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment.
I thought so!
She'll be out in a moment.
But you said grey, sir.
Well that's what I said.
I said how's it going?
What's that?
How ya doing?
What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn Mini-Mart?!
Where's the candy?
They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
They're singing.
Don't snap at them!
So. When is the wedding.
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
There's more.
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
Shut up Boyd! Micheal?
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
Don't sweet lip me.
I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
Is everything okay?
Sweet deal.
She's still working?
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
Doing the bachelor party thing?
The groom?
So who's the lucky guy?
Okay. Hi.
Where is she?
I'm with Tina. Is she there?
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
The rings?
May we have the rings please?
It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
Everything okay?
I love you so much it hurts. Me and your mother marvel at what you have become. You're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl. I feel it deep inside. A wonderful, magical journey.  And I'm, like I said, just so proud of how you turned out.  You go out and knock 'em dead Keith. Knock'em dead!
Just kills me...
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
Oh I know that. How does it go...
What song?
Okay great. What will that be?
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
Okay boys, smile!
The post-Vegas Man.
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile...
Well, I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling.
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
So where to on the honeymoon?
Take your time. I wish I had.
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
It's a present from my parents.
Where's the camera?
Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
Stop this, stop this.
Yes, yes.
Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
You'd like me to kill them?
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
Then I'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
Give them to Refugio.
No, the children sleep with me.
I'll come to you tonight.
Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
Take me there.
That one.
Which couch?
They're playing games behind the couch ...
What about them?
Enedina and Paco ...
What's that?
Don Amalio!
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.
Then it's a respectable house.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
Are there many windows?
Two.
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
Yes, sir.
But what can I say to her, sir?
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
What's the matter?
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
Yes, sir. Good night.
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
Enedina's going to take a picture. So we'll have a souvenir.
Yes.
Is it all right?
If everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours.
She won't even know.
What will the lady say?
No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?
That's good land.
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
That's it.
Fifteen yards.
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
He was asking for it.
Thank you; but it's missing something.
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
You see how much you like her?
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
That your cousin is more to your taste.
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
You're happy, aren't you!
What are you going to do?
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
Let her do what she wants. She doesn't bother us in any way. She minds her business and we ...
She's mad.
Why the bad temper?
What's the matter with you?
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
Where's the dough?
Me, rich? Come on!
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
I don't know -- they've always been there.
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
I don't know, sir.
He was very good. Better than some people would think.
Canelo!
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
I wasn't thinking of selling him, but if you want ... I'll leave it to you.
He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.
And let him get run over by somebody else?
It's for people!
He's lying through his ass!
You'll soon find out, you liar!
Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Things seem to be getting better.
They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.
They told me it isn't at the hospital.
They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.
Come with me.
There's been an accident.
You cannot leave ...
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
You little liar! Get out of here!
He came in through the cupboard.
He couldn't get through the door, then?
Yes -- very, very big!
Very, very?
It's a very big one.
A black bull!
A black bull came.
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
I'm afraid.
Why are you crying?
Yes!
But, miss ...
This louse is looking for trouble.
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
Are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?
Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.
A suicide is horrible. I know. But you should have told me.
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
I've had a gutful of this.
I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
When you are, miss.
Ask the priest, miss.
She looks like a sick marrow!
I'm only good at making people laugh.
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
That will soon pass. It's nothing.
How do you feel?
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.
No, I don't want to.
From the terrace.
Yes, yes, I saw you!
Today, a good girl.
Hello.
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
Me? What did I do?
Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful.
It was very wellhidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
) There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming. It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it.
) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies...
You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe online, yet?
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
I wish we could hear them.
I don't know.
Why would they be going there?
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
But only you will know he's not human.
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
Catch him and your record's clean.
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
Whatever.
You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
Why wasn't I told?
My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
On my life, I promise you I will.
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
Fine  you want to stay here?
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
If you can catch him.
Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
What about them?
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar  you making it okay in there?
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you.  You may not believe this, Parker,
You all right?
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
You think he's smart?
Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
In other words, we collectively don't know shit.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twentyfour citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in...  I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.
I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you.
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment.
Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell.
This better not be a wild goose chase.
You know how much man power you're talking about?
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
Enough to level an entire city block.
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
What did you find out?
Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
This is a full pardon. It authorizes your immediate release.
Think you can do it?
Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do.
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
I was assured the problem was corrected.
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
What the hell happened?
Don't remind me.
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
What did Cox pull him out early for?
As a matter of fact, I do.
How does he know who I am?
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
You've had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
You embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
What I need is a nymphomaniac.
I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you...
... and you get nanodeath.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
Separate the character module from the neural net...
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
You're...such a wimp.
Bastard...  Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
I haven't been working on anything.
HEY!!!
At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
Do they have to look so...robotic?
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
For Schumann.
It's the White House.
...on the way in.

What if he's busy tonight?

Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
They don't know what's going on!
Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...
What about tipping off Yurovich?
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
Grand Marnier.
Oh really.
Please, no thanks...
No, thank you. I knew the minute I laid eyes on you, you had what it takes Bud. Just keep it going.
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
Somebody has to pay for that error. And it's not me.
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.
Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.
Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
So whaddaya say pal, wanna play some doubles at Piping? Meet the membership? I got a little blonde named Mandy, about nineteen, avec cafe au lait boobs... she's mine but she's got a cousin who has great muffins.
...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up...
You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
Buddy boy, how ya doing?
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
What are you doing here?
I don't know anything!
You sure?
What if they call him?
What if he asks where I got the money?
I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
Sure, and I'm never gonna die either, is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas?
So you're hot on this stock?
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
Bud! Where you been the last two days?
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
How you doing Buddy?
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
You got it, G.G.
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.
We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here,  you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar.
If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
Are you prepared to put that in writing?
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
A body.  I mean we're talking major body
What's that?
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
But?
So why are you dating Jonathan?
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, OK
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
Businessman!
Businessman?
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
He did?
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
He still likes you
With Mark?
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
Ok toots, I will.
Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
Suffer?  We're living in America.
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
About what?  About us.
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
It's eleven forty-five let's go
Anybody want another drink?
Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke
Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?
Yes, I guess you're right
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
Would you like a closer look?
Hmm.
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
Hi
Weird and tiny huh?
Too late for that sir.  Give my love to the misses.  Get those bastards!
Jenkins.  Can I get you some help?
Good evening sir.
Jenkins!
We're all here, and ready sir!
Have a nice day  sir
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
Allow me sir
Thank you
And uh, your nicotine sir
Thank you
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Thank you Jenkins
Your books Master Loftmore
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
Can I give her a message?
A party at a waxwork huh?
She went to a waxwork party
No?
No Jonathan.
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
Hello?
Vell.  Goodnight.
Tony and China?
They seemed, closing by much
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
I hope you enjoyed your visit.
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
Go away.
Sarah listen to me.
China
Well, it all started when a friend and I
Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
Well?
Who's is all this?
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Big deal!
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
Oh that explains everything.
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
A little?
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
That's not what you said last night.
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
Come on.
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
No Mark. MARK Why not?
I know what you mean.
Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
Then why do you still like her?
I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
What?  Tony and China, together?
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
Haven't we been doing our homework.
This. is killer.
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
This time I really don't see anyone man.
Right behind you.
Anyone else not coming?
Right.
Safety in numbers man.
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
Maybe before the event, never after.
Can this be stopped?
Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales.  Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil.  I think  that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it.  There's a  voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a  belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a  believing victim, you can bring him back to life!
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
Sell my soul?
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
Six six and six
Well divide 18 into three
Well?
Well, it's a long story.SIR WILFRED Oh good share.  I love them
So Mark, what's so urgent?
No thank you sir we're fine.
Hi there Sarah
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
I'll think about it.  Now run along darling.
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
They're all human beings
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
Mom.
Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.
Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first.
Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
YES!
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
You bet.  We all can't be such modern people
You guys are being real assholes
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH Stop it!
Stop saying things so loud!
The wives.
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Toward the end.  You remember?
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
I know how hard it can be sometimes.
Wonderful.  It's good to see you two doing so well.
Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.
How're you holding up?
Everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity.
Of course.  You must be so proud.
I didn't kill my wife.
Who?
I have to go.
I don't know.
She isn't here.
This really isn't a good time.
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
Yes?
Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
They're calling me in to work.
Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing.  Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened.
Why are you here?
Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
You look a little old for a student.
Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
She never mentioned you.
What's your name?
Please leave me alone.
You know where she is?
Yeah.
She got it.  Turned it down.
I'm not.  Couldn't pick up my cello for weeks.
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
You should have heard her play.
And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
I came in from my room...
...just so she could cut them off.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
This is...
:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
:Well, they are.
:Would you stop it!
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp...   Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
With his hands!
Two heartbeats.
There are two.
Are you alright...?  You look pale.
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
But you've not told Michael.
I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both.
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
A spacial entity.  An organized energy.  something that precedes our definition of existence.
Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.
Rowan...
What are you talk---
Every day  twice.
Nothing was ever more false.
Yes - and you have.  Do you see...?  He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
What have the witches always asked of you...?
Michael, Rowan should -
Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
A spirit.  Perhaps evil...   ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
Come.  There is a lot to read
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.  At the cemetery by now, I would guess.
It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.'   Darling, I'd say you're on a roll.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
Giff - shuttup.    you're mother was a sweet child, Rowan... A lost little girl in a world too full at things
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
Now, lasher - it is our time.
Lasher - bring us through!
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
Michael...  Do what you can.
Help us.  Do what you can.
The door, Michael.  find the key...
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back
Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
uh - then he - be just -
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
Parents say he - uh - fell -
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.
Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
Tell me what I am, Rowan.
That is what you must discover.   see what I am, my love. With all your power - see me, and know what I am.
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
I do not understand...
What is wrong...?
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
Then help me--- for his sake...
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
Do not tell me that!
But I could understand. I want to understand!
you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.
A girl...?
From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has wanted me!  suzann. and Deborah.  Stella - Marguerite - Antha  - Diedre -  All of them.  And you will have a child...
If that were true, I would not be here.
There is no one here but the dead.
I bring her flowers too.
I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?

If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
If you knew how I yearn for that...
It is from love.
Explain this to me --- violated...?
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
Always loved you..
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
Like this...?
There are things you will not tell him.
You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie...?
I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever.
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
Yessss...
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
Harder...
Rowan...
Harder...
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
You okay...?
Wow...
That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...?
You can't just -
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
Is that a crack about our singing...?
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
You really love this guy...?
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
We'd better get to work on the papers.
Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
A person could get killed round here just for working late
OH MY GAWD!
Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
Don't give me shit - what do you want?
Which do you think is her best shot...
This must be one of the old keys -
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
No - not all the time - I mean
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
That's right...
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
Yes it is...
BRIAN...
Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
CHIC MAGAZINE?
He saved my life you know - has he told you...
Is LESLIE here?
What happened?
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
What?
What's wrong with you?
I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
So have you seen hubby recently ELLEN?
It's been what, three years?
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
Her husband left her
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?
Don't worry about it -
No worries
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
ANGEL...
Yes - one please.
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
Dead?
INSPECTOR DAVE TAYLOR - Scotland yard ...Can I have a word?
Dr STECKLER?
Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces.  Are you hungry?
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny.
I mean, what do you think?
Well?
Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself.
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
Which you pulled, hard!
You know...take the pictures?
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
Hi, Teddy Bear.
Makes your shoulders look so big and broad.
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
Ted, have you lost your mind?
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
If you don't have...I mean...
And I was wondering.
Well. The prom's coming up.
You go first.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
Everything.
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
Can you believe that was me?
We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
But how can you respect yourself if you don't?
I understand.
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them.
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in "Heaven?"
Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee?
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
I'm warning you.
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
Rules are rules.
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
I never figured you for a pimp.
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.
Your fathered owned the entire "Heaven" empire.  You own it now. Any questions?
Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
How quaint.
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
It's about your parents.
I'm just a messenger.
Bad news.
In a hurry, are we?
I... You know... I...
The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle.  You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one.
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
Kelly Van Ryan...
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
And where might that be?
Thanks.
She's going to wash your Jeep?
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
Merritt, Forensics.
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
You okay?
And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child.  He was a good boy, till the army took him.
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
About Suzie?
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye.  He don't use it for no good deeds anyway.
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
I don't care.  You heard that girl's statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me a case.
I want a full-scale investigation.
Where's this coming from?
Why?
Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
You didn't cuff her?
She bit you?
Just tell us what happened.
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
Oh, Ray... no...
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
Are you crazy, Ray?
And what do they say?
What about witnesses?
The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
Your Honor... Please...
I'm sorry?
Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
Ms. Toller?
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
What did you do then?
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
Yeah.  But I got my bike.
What?
You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
No!
Yeah, but...
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
It's those rocks, up there.
Where, the mall?
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
He... Sam Lombardo?
What?
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
Kelly.  What is it?
I would hardly say you look like trash.
Okay, what's the matter?
Whichever one I want.
Sam!  Hi!
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro.
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Come on, let loose!
Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
For you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you... It doesn't add up.  Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em running scared.  And I'll tell you something else, you rush, you get careless.
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
But check this...
You can't...
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
Who is it?
That's right.
Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
Shit. Here we go again.
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
He's not giving up?
He calls it the Tarantula.
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
Yes, me!
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
That would be correct.  Orders from the President himself.  Trans- portation at your beck and call. No delays.  Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well.
Your private train, sir.
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...
French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!
Yes sir.
French?
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
On my way to Denver...
And now the job's yours.
Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...
Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
This is Colonel Richards.
That'll be all, boys.
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
It is?
It's a smelting retort.
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
Yes!
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
Hey...!
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
They're coming.
Let's go.
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
You're chasing a dream.
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
You managed alright.
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
You are very important, Willow.
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...
Willow Ufgood.
Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
Go in the direction the bird is flying.
Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition.
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
Not today, Willow.
I have no family.
Madmartigan.
I don't believe you.
I love you.
Why did you say that?
You're a fool.  Now put her back.
I do what I'm told.
My step-father's going to tear you apart.
You're not a woman.
Why not?
Let me see it.
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
Are you scared?
Dada, what's a daikini?
Can't we keep it, Dada?
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
Ouch!  Let go of me!
Get back here, Rool!
Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
We gotta follow them.
Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
Are you sure?
Me neither!
I'm not going in there.
He never misses.
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
Somebody has to do it.
Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
Who is he?
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
I changed her already!
Shut up.
Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
Obviously.
The sorceress.
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
Hey, careful there!
Talk!  Say something!
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
You're the guardian, aren't you?
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
John, why?...
John, I don't understand any of this.
Who are these orphans, anyway?
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
Everything is all right, John.
Nail it!
Your hole is healed, then?
No matter. Come with me. We can always use a good carpenter.
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
I came to see Rachel Lapp.
English, Yankee. It's the same. My name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.  You look plain, Book.  Very plain.
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
Say again?
That's more like it.  Where are you at, anyway?
You hear me?
Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch  I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
I hear you.
Johnny, what the fuck?
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
It won't happen again.
I got there late, John.
I didn't even know about it.
What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
He's got my number.
I admit I don't know where he is.
Probably.
Wrong.
I don't know where he is.
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know  anybody who knows John  knows that's a goddamn lie!
Did you find him?
Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?
No? Why not?
God, Fred...
What's so funny?
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
You didn't have to...
Oh.
John said you're Amish.
Everything okay?
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
He's not in this building.
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
Tight. But I'm working on him.
She say where he is?
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
Yes, darling.
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Dorothy!
Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
Uhh -- yeah --
Yes.
Oh, I hope we got them in time.
Yes.
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
You'll be hist...
From now on you'll be history
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
If any!
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
Is morally, ethic'ly
If she?
If she...
To see?
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Do you presume to criticize the....
Not so fast!  Not....
...resourceful!
Oh ....
...have you come back?
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
Goodbye, folks!
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.  And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
Uhhhh -- yes...
Are you all right, Dorothy?
Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
Catch him, you fool!
No!  Fool, that I am!  I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as...
Ahh!  Ah!
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
...didn't you?
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
Now you're seeing reason.
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.
Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way....
You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,....
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
Ah --
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
NO!
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
No, her dog!
You mean she bit you?
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
... about Dorothy.
I want to see you and your wife right away....
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
Mr. Gale!
...of the West.
Quiet!
...junk!
...Tin Man!
Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious....
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
Well --
Well, I --
Well, I --
Well, I --
Yes.
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
-- Ruined my exit!
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Yes -- ....
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
...yes?...
Then maybe Id be... open to that.
James.  It wouldnt really be...
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It wont just be two weeks out of action.
I cant tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
Your last chance. Take the money.
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
In case youve forgotten.  Im dead already.
You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldnt have done it without you.
Its I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  Shes beautiful isnt she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.
He was my father.
A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
Beautiful, isnt it?
Yes.  Au revoir...
This is the end.
He was a...good lover?
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  Its what you wanted.
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
Is it?
Still no contact yet.
Its heading for the oil terminal.
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
Please.
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
What about our end?
They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
Washington?
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
No idea who's behind this?
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
Had a lot of blood in him.
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
We don't know that.
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
Who is she?  Do you know her?
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
Walter --
My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better than ever.
-- What?
I can fix it.
Janey, will you marry me?
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
We should get back --  What?
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
With lots of ketchup?
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
Isn't it true that you --
Did you know he was back on the streets?
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
I'm terribly sorry.
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
Their real names, please.
No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
You're making a big --
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
I've seen enough. Turn it off.
The scum of the Earth.
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
How will you fix it?
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
What do you have?
Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
That's some accident, hombre. You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard.
Whatchu doing here?
He gets to be the hero.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
What do you get if you finish?
What weapons do you have?
"Anarchy" 99"?
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
Naturally.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
What game is that?
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
This is your standard dart gun.
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
You're serious?
What...?
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
I'm through, Xander.
They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Sorry, "dude".
Is this what you're looking for?
You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
The corner. Anarchy 99.
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
Sit down.
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
It's like you said, every man for himself.
He's a pretty good actor, though.
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
What's so damn funny?
Beast.
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
We all do.
I wish I could go.
... until he found tungsten.
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
What does that mean?
So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
For what purpose?
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
Its core?
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
Jean... can you?
Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south entrance.  Jean and I will go in here.
It's too far.
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
Uh-huh.
Into the Hudson?
Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.
What's that?
I'll tell you one thing though.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
Are you all right?
We have to find Magneto.
He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
What's wrong with him?
If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
What are you talking about?
I don't like him being here.
Scott.. I -
Sure you are, sport.
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
Shut up.  I got no interest in you, Xavier,  or your... X-Men.
You know, you --
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
How long have you been in Alaska?
I wanted to talk to you.
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
Yeah, I'll bet you have.
I've seen a lot of rings.
Logan, do you see this ring?
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
He takes himself seriously.
He takes his work seriously.
He's uptight.
Suit yourself.
Let go.
Not interested.
What do you say?
Were you now?
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
He's busy right now.
You should always work with a spotter.
What if they're naughty?
If necessary.
By reading my thoughts?
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
What if I like the pain?
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
Anything else I can get you?
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
Tell it to the ones that did this to me.
Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
Senator?
Dr. Grey.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -
Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
Let's just say, God works too slowly.
What is it you intend to do to me?
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
The intention of registration act -
Gosh, I hope so.
Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.
You mutant bastards...
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
What are you going to do?
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
Where am I?
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
What do you want?
I do love a good check mate.
What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
Don't you knock?
I'll go.
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
He helped you?
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
You designed this yourself?
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
How?
To find Rogue.
Where are we going?
I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
Now that's Magneto talking.
What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?
The point of what?
Deal.
Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
Who?
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
What am I doing here?
And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
If she held on any longer she could have.
I felt like she almost killed me.
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
What did she do to me?
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
Why is everybody up at sunrise?
ALIVE.
I'll find him.
Enough for a test.
Is it enough?
A piece.  Only a piece.
Is that what you're looking for?
It was Xavier's people.  They knew.
How?
I lost him.
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
It does indeed, Max.
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
I know.
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
What do you mean to do?
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
The way what is going to be?
If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
Is that so?
What do you want with him?
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
Oh, shit.
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
Yes, my dear, he is.
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
Now wait a minute!
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
What was your grandfather's name?
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
And who might you be?
Frederick Frankenstein?
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
From your office, sir.
I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done!
Yes, sir.
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
I did, sir.
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
MMmmm.
MMmmm.
MMmmm.
MMmmm.
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
MMMmm!
MMMmmmm.
Baack!
Baack!
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Will there be anything else?
I think you must be mistaken, sir.
This is the only library I know of.
I don't know what you mean, sir.
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
You mean... the laboratory??
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a pleasant journey!
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
Yes, sir.
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
Break that old man's violin.
Why did you do that?
A week.  Ten days at most.
Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?
Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
Dr. Frankenstein?
MMMmmmmmm.
MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.
Soo -- pah doo -- per.

Ja, ja.
It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
Foooooood!
Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.
Drink!
I'm sorry, sir.  We only seat by reservation.
Food!!
Do you have a reservation?
Food!
Yes, sir, name, please?
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
Why don 't the Zulus attack?
One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .
So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.

Our friend Colonel Dumford will be  should be   at this minute approaching Pulleine. I think we'll eat here. I want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour. .
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
An historical moment, Gentlemen.
And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
I'm explaining my reasons.
Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
They come well recommended do they? DURNFORD
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
Certainly, Sin
Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.
A large party of Zulus have been sighted in the direction of the King's KraaL Getting up, CHELMSFORD moves over to look at the map on his desk.
Yes?
Thank you.
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
Our runners bare his dispatches, do they not?
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
But will they make good use of them?
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Yes.
Stuart?
Keep steady. You're the best shots of the Twenty-Fourth. You bunch of heathens, do it
Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
Which one?
Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
So far only their scouts. But we have had reports of a small Impi farther north, over there.
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
Your orders, Mr Vereker?
Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
