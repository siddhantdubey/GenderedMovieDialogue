They do not!
I hope so.
Let's go.
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
What good stuff?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
do you listen to this crap?
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
But
Well, no...
I was?
Tons
You know Chastity?
Hi.
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
You're sweet.
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
Where?
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Forget French.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
I did.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Joey.
Where did he go?  He was just here.
You might wanna think about it
Did you change your hair?
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Hi, Joey.
Neat...
Queen Harry?
Hopefully.
Expensive?
Perm?
Patrick -- is that- a.
It's just you.
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
No! I just wanted
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
I just wanted --
You set me up.
Let go!
So did you
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
I guess I'll never know, will I?
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
That's not
No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
Why didn't you tell me?
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
But
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
You did what?
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
As in...
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
But you hate Joey
He was, like, a total babe
Why?
In 9th.  For a month
What?
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
Like you care.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
You're welcome.
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
Can we go now?
You are so completely unbalanced.
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
What's normal?
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
What do you think?
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
Where've you been?
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
No, but
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
Why?
Daddy, no!
It's just a party. Daddy.
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Daddy, I --
But she doesn't want to date.
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
What if she never starts dating?
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
Leave my sister alone.
Away.
Hey -- do you mind?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Who?
Have you seen him?
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
You didn't
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I didn't have a choice.
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
Who cares?
What'd he say?
No fear.
You think this'll work?
If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."
Does it matter?
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
Neither has his heterosexuality.
That's never been proven
William didn't even go to high school
William would never have gone to a state school.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
An attempted slit.
What's this?
Just a little.
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
Block E?
He always look so
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
Who's that?
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Is that right?
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
That ' s completely adorable!
What?
Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
It's just something I had.  You know
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
Answer the question, Patrick
You tell me.
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
No, I won't go with you
No.
Is that a request or a command?
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
What?
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
Tell me something true.
I know the porn career's a lie.
The duck?
State trooper?
For. . . ?
How?
Something like that
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
Acting the way we do.
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
I dazzled him with my wit
Good call.
The Partridge Family?
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Put your right foot there --
C'mon.  It's not that bad
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
Unwelcome.
You 're so --
What are you doing here?
BIANCA
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Oh, so now you think you know me?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
This.
I should do this.
Why'd you lie?
No, you weren't
Were you in jail?
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
What?
You know what they say
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
I hate him.
Who?
Just let me sit down.
Like you could find one
Why?
You don't care if I die
Why 're you doing this?
This is so patronizing.
I know, just let me sleep
I just need to lie down for awhile
I'm fine. I'm
Funny, you're the only one
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
You know who The Raincoats are?
That's what you want, isn't it?

Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
Hi
Are you following me?
You -- covered in my vomit.
And why would I do that?
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
Oh, right.  Friday.
My mission in life.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
When I go?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Parts of it.
No, Daddy.
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
So what I want doesn't matter?
Because you're making decisions for me.
I thought you were punishing me.
Then tell them I had a seizure.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
You decided.
I know.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Tempestuous?
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Yeah...
Right.
You think?
Yeah.  I guess.
Hi.
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
Pouring it out!
I'll get my clothes.
In the kitchen.
Right.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
I'm sorry.
Are you alright?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
What are you asking me?
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
No.
No.
Yes, I considered it.
So...the station is empty?
Somewhere else?
Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
Are you married?
I will if they don't send me back.
Now I become custody of police department?
Yes, but he was a cop.
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
Thank you.
Okay.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
You promise?
Okay, til tonight.
I love you.
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Promise?
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
Yeah.
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
You're not so bad yourself.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Stop it.
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
Hey, honey.
Okay.
Alright.
Alright.
Eddie, are you okay?
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
Is it drug related?
Can we go up to the crime scene?
How many victims are up there?
Detective, does it look like a murder?
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
Alright.  Go ahead.
I want to hear everything he said.
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
You're impossible...
Tell me.
Where is he?
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
You real down?
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Hey, I don't believe it.
Fuck you.
Hello.
Jack, wait...
Jack?  What was that?
So am I.
No wonder you're so popular.
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Jack, are you okay?
You made the front page.
Great place for lunch.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Call me later.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
I'm all wet.
You're hopeless.
I still don't think it's loaded.
I don't think your gun's loaded...
What am I wanted for?
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
That's no bull.
How would you know?
Shrink major, not a shrink.
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Who the hell are you?
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
Napoleon... small.
Corn-i-Lius?
Tell me...
Why?... Why would you need me?
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
...Like love...
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
I want to sleep... forever...
I'm so tired...
...The rain falls...
The wind blows... the fire burns...
Protect life... Until death.
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I'm so very sad.
You're nothing but a... a...
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
OK, you can turn around!
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
You know women normally change five times more than men.
...Hoppi-hoppa.
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
Apipoussan!
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
All 900.
Learning language.
What is... Make Love?
Love...
Apipoulai!
Dinoine chagantakat!
Cornelius..
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
Apipoulai!
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
Tom... she's dead.
What?
Who are you calling?
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
You're killing me...
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
You should have.
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
You couldn't?
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
Tom...
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
What happened to you?
... What's going on?
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
Hello?
Why the gun?
I know.
I understand.
Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
I love you.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
How's the detective business?
Okay, I believe you.
I'm not accusing you...
Your clothing reeks of it.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Welcome home.
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
I can't go back to sleep again.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
I can't find him.
It was bad.
Kristen...
What?
What's wrong?
Rick...I can't.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
I don't want to.
What?
Kristen, what happened?
You what?
When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
I'm sure they're around.
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
Then you saw him, too?
You've been up all night?
We have matching luggage.
I know.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
You in a hurry?
Save it for later.  Come on!
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
Here we are.
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
It's okay, we're just about there.
You just feel sorry for me.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
Not really.
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
Three days.
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
I've been working double shifts.
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
I know.  Uh...Alice.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
No...
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
It was Freddy.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
Rick, please.
You're not taking my baby!
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
It's okay, Dan
But how...?
What do you mean?
Where is he?
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
Who says I don't like you?
Who said I...wait, what?
Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
Is that who you're waiting for?
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
How did you know that?
My name is...
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
Huh?
Me too.
You're right.
Yeah...I guess.
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
I know.
The tickets.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
But Dad --
I've got to go.
You disappointed in me?
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Very funny.
How was the meeting?
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
It's just across the park.
Thanks for everything, Dad.
To take a picture.
Dad!
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
He sure loves to stay awake.
So did Dan.
You do good work, Alice.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
But how are we gonna --
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
What?
If they actually bothered to bury her.
You think that's the place she's buried?
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
Are you alright?
That's the only reason you're alive...
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
Krueger is reality.
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
Why don't you two stick to reality.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
What's that got to do with it?
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
Did everyone call everyone?
He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
No, the Dan part was nice...
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
Had kind of a long night.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
I don't understand.
Poor woman...
But I've seen her grave.
Meaning?
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
They think I'm nuts.
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
Where are you going?
I don't know!
My baby!
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
Nobody thinks that.
Mark!
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
Mark, are you okay?
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
All of us.  Right?
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
Makes you look like a nun--
You, too?
It's okay.
I can't listen to this.
Mark...
Vomit?
Two hours a day, six days a week.
All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
No.
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
Has anybody offered to buy it?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
Who?
Who?
Always has been.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Are you alright, Wade?
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
I want to go home.
Oh.
You're a policeman.
That's illegal, you know.
I want to go home.
What are you sorry for?
Okay.
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
Nothing.
No.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
Oh.
Pop?
It's pretty old.
Are we going in this?
Dad.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Yes.
I called Mommy.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
No.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
It's stupid.
It's not that.
I don't want to.
No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
I just think you used to be bad.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
But it's not funny now.
Was it funny?
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Yeah. It's stupid.
You know.
Why do they do that?
I don't care. They're out.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
What happened?
Wade.
How?
Think they're alright?
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
I know your parents.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
Alright. I'll think about it.
You've been married twice --
Oh, Wade.
Then... I guess you have to.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
It's nice.
What way?
You knew me as a kid.
But not now.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
Jack doesn't need money.
Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
Okay.
Call me.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
You don't mean that.
I'm sorry.
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
I'm sorry about what I said.
You okay?
You okay?
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
How's she doing?
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
Can --?
When did she die?
Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze.  Wade, would you do that?
You're not using it today?
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
Ted, the lever!
Compute!
Set!
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
What will happen to him, Ted?
You mean...
Simon just ejected!
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
That was very well put, Ted.
I mean until we start to burn up.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Ted, please be careful.
Ted, there's no time to explain.
Ted!
Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
I'd use the word insane.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Ted!
Ted.
What are you doing, Ted?
Ted, we're taking off!
Ted!  What are you...?
Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
If that's the way you want it.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
Who's that, Ted?
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Ted, what's wrong?
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Te...!
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Is that a good sign, Doctor?
I mean for Ted.
What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
Simon, what are you saying?!
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
Can't we change course?
Simon, what's happening?!
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
I think so.
Don't be too long.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
No, I've been excited before.
I'm so excited, Simon.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
Simon.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
Yes, sir.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Request; life support systems check.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Go ahead.
That's okay, ROK.
That's not possible.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
No. No one that I know of.
Well...
No.
Just how serious is it, doctor?
He had fish, too.
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
He had fish.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Certainly.
A hospital? What is it?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
Uh-huh.
The gear is down.
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Ted...
But Ted, you're the only...
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
And a little ice!
Rain.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
What's his problem?
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?
You got a telegram from head­quarters today.
But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
I remember everything. All I have are memories.
I love you.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
What's the matter?
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
Ted, what are you doing here?
It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
I just don't want to go over it any more.
Ted!
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Who wants to be first?
We'd better get back now.
We have a visitor.
You did okay, Bishop.
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
HOW MUCH TIME?
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
What?
And it's too late to shut it down?
How long until it blows?
Could it be intelligent?
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
Sorry to disappoint you.
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
You son of a bitch.
Bullshit!
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
Why not?
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
That the atmosphere processor?
I hope you're right.  I really do.
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.
If I go.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
That's right.
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it.
No.  There's no way!
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
I get the picture.
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
Amy.
Is she...?
Have they located my daughter yet?
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Forget it.
How do you feel?
They're but off!  Do something!
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
I don't know.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
One of us?
The structure seems intact.  They have power.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
Ellen.
Hicks, don't let him leave.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
Locked.
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.
Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
What's this?
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
They'll get us.
But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
Now many?
On my way.
That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
Seal the door.
Just get back here!
They cut the power.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
Thanks.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
Looks like it stung him.
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
No.. I've slept enough.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
Terrible.
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
Can we dream?
That's right.
Are we going to sleep now?
Right here, baby.  Right here.
Mommy...Mommy?
Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
I knew you'd come.
Newt, wait!
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
Sure.  Go left.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Come on.  Crawl faster.
Look!
Burke!  Open the door!
I know, honey.  Me too.
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
Wah...?  Where are...?
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Don't go!  Please.
You mean dead.
Gone.
Where is she?
Yes.  A little girl.
Did you ever have a baby?
No, it's different, honey.
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
Did one of those things grow inside her?
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
Why do they tell little kids that?
Yes, there are, aren't there.
My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault.
I'm sorry, Newt.
I guess we're not leaving, right?
You're really something, ace.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
And hope to die?
Cross my heart.
You promise?
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
They're dead.
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
Why not?
I don't want you for a friend.
What about me?
Casey.  She's my only friend.
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
What did you say?
Sweet Jesus.
How many colonists?
What are you talking about. What people?
Why won't you check out LV-426?
...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
Look, I told you...
Meaning you didn't like it.
What did you think of the music?
How was I? Tell me honestly.
Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
The marriage!
Did you know? Had you heard?
Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
Why?
What does he look like?
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
Oh!
What's that?
Where?
Why not?
How do you know?
Is there a part for me?
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Maestro.
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
Is she a good fuck?
I'm so relieved.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
Don't bother.
Don't bother!
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
Yes!
I want to go back to Vienna.
I want to go!
Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
Why not?
Give me one reason I can understand.
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
Why?
Why not?
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
I heard voices.
Who was that?
Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
You're not going to do this?
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
Your father is dead.
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Wolfi.
No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
I don't know.
There's a young girl to see you.
Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here.
Wolfi!
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
I love you! I love you!
No!
Tell them to go!
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Yes!
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
Eat my - ah!
Eat
What?
Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
No!
No, I'm not playing this game.
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Do you think that's funny?
That's stupid.
Why not?
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
Fartsbishop!
Where?
No! No! No!
Stop it!
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.
He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
This is not his handwriting.
And I'm asking you -
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
Why you?
What are you doing here?
Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
But! I'm a married woman!
What do you mean?
What for?
Tonight?
Oh, thank you, sir!
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
Yes.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
No, sir. This is my own idea.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
He's terribly busy, sir.
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
Excellency!
Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
Money! Money!
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
He's doing his best.
Leave him alone!
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
Not at all.
How much will you pay him?
Do you hear him? Do you?
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
Well, this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
In three months! Papa.
Oh, yes.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
I don't know. He has pains.
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
In there, sir.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Not that I've seen.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Yes, thank you, sir.
I will, sir.
Good morning, sir.
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
Are you Herr Mozart?
Thank you.
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
How did he look?
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
David?
What shall we do?
No, a cab will be faster.
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Yes, Doctor.
Yes, I should think so.
No, not really.
No, why?
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
He's here.
What shall we do?
Dr. Hirsch?
Surely you're not suggesting...
No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
And what else?
Yes.
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Yes.
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
He's not?
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
Yes, sir.
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
Yes, I believe he did.
No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
What happened to them?
He said 'Jack'.
Yes, Doctor?
Yes, Doctor.
Dr. Hirsch?
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
David, don't lose control.
David, let's go now.
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
We had an argument. He's being silly.
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
Jack is dead!
David, stop!
David, what are you doing?
But...
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
The next corner we can get a cab.
Don't you remember?
The zoo?
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
I've left those pills for you.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Anything.
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
Tomorrow is the full moon.
But, David.
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
Of course.
Yes?
It's nice to see you.
David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
The bedroom.
Bathroom.
Closet.
The kitchen.
I would think so.
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
Your dead friend Jack?
You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
Are you better now?
A werewolf?
Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
What?
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
That's easy enough.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
Hello. You all right?
Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
Shall I read to you?
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
I know.
Twenty-eight.
That's not really a very proper question.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
What do you dream about?
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
I thought you were asleep.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
Right.
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
Call me Alex.
Sorry.
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
You haven't eaten your lunch.
Mr. Kessler?
What?
I beg your pardon?
I thought not.
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
No what?
How are we feeling tonight?
Right.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
Feeling better?
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
No what?
Hello, Benjamin.
Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
Why on earth do you say that?
Chart says he's from New York.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Has he been refusing food?
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
Why, Matt!
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals  I think I will have a drink.
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
What's this?
Cyril!
Why, Cyril, you're insane
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
What?
No.
Why are you so anxious?
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
Well, what?
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.
See, we're getting along famously!
Doesn't that come next?
Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks
Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
Me?
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
No.
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night?
Well . . .
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
The girls!  I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
Yes, of course.
The theatre?
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
Yes.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
Hello, darling.
Oh!
Good morning.
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
Yes, sir.
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
Yes, sir.
Longer.
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Why - well, I
I don't know.
Good morning.
All right.
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
Hardly.
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
No.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
I'm afraid so.
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
He's at a board meeting.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
Mr. Williams . . .
Did you talk to him?
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
Oh, Matt . . .
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
Oh now, don't be silly.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
What's keeping you?
In Cluett's office?
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
Well . . . ?
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
Oh, Matt.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
The ten dollars.
What did you do with it?
Oh, is that so?
Come here, honey!
Matt, come here!
Yes, sir.
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
He was in the bank yesterday.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
He thinks this is some kind of game!
I think he's already feeling better.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
Daddy, don't start with this again.
Tennessee?
Don't swear.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
If you don't see it, it's not real...
Don't turn around.
Stop it. This is just sad.
Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
"But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."
Hmm.
Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
I don't understand.
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Let the law --
You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
I am so sorry, Jesse.
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Sparkling rocks?
Where will you find such a girl?
And what's this right girl like?
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
A river pirate.
You didn't want to farm?
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
You're sick of my company?
You shouldn't be up.
Jesse, is that your hand?
Jesse, are you awake?
But still died.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
Nothing.
Patrick?
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
You never noticed.
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
That's nice.
What are you doing tonight?
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
Oh God, just get it over with.
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip   to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
Take it off.
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
Turn the light on.
Pull out, goddamnit!
Pull out.
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
Luis is a despicable twit.
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
This is Dorsia?
Are we here?
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children...
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish.
Pick me up?
Okay. Yeah. What time?
You like it there, don't you?
Dorsia's nice.
I can't.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
I know. Stop it.
Uh huh.
Yes?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
Stop it. I'm...
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
But where?
Where are you going?
Oh God, I can't believe this.
No, no, no.
You're inhuman.
But what about the past? Our past?
You're really serious, aren't you?
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
Why? What's wrong?
I want a firm commitment.
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
Are you using minoxidil?
Everybody has a great body now.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
Everybody's rich.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
We should do it.
Yes, darling?
Get married. Have a wedding.
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
Why?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
Where are you?
Patrick? Is that you?
Patrick Bateman's office.
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
Hmmmm.
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
Sorry.
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
What's that?
Who's Ted Bundy?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
No, not really.
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
Want a bite?
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
You didn't give them a name.
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Anywhere you want?
Oh no. I have no plans.
Yes, Patrick?
Yes, Patrick?
Patrick?
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Patrick?
Thanks, Patrick.
You don't like this, I take it?
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Yes?
You look nice today.
I'll do it.
Oh, something. . romantic?
Yes, sir.
Just say no?
Oh? And what should I say?
After six.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
Late?
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Does he do this all the time?
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
I want the number, idiot.  Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you.
Who?
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
Why would I?
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Uh huh?
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
I can paint anywhere.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
"Make" him?
You are a fanatic.
Is it over?
You're just afraid to eat it.
It's gonna get cold.
Here we go.
Oh, right. Hold on.
Milo?
I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
Just shut up?
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
Milo, you --
Milo --
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
What?
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
That was -- different.
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
Guilt?
I remember.
...Why?
Nothing?
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
...Whaddo I do?
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
You can't just walk in, either.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
Milo. Why would he --
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
They hack into people's programs?
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
It was a hate crime.
Teddy was killed last night.
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
He's your boss. He's not your --
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Milo! What about --?
We're not gonna let it.
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
No way. You have this -- destiny.
Didn't you visit the campus?
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
It's important.
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.
I don't think he knows how.
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
Prick.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
No.
Latitude 47 degrees.
What?
Maybe it's the satellite.
But you said the other --
It's three years old, it --
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
Please don't go.
Why?!
Does he know you know?
You'll come up with something.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Gary.
What'd he say?
'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
You mean -- break in?
Before they kill somebody else, too.
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
But they'd still get the idea, right?
A what?
He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this --  mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.
How close are you?
Time?
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
What about "60 Minutes."
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
Who can we trust?
What about the FBI?
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
...Milo?
He's out of prison?
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
Oh yeah?
But why would they --?
The Day Care?
Why would you do a thing like --
That's great. I -- didn't know.
Then and now.  But not right now.
Long story. Not that interesting.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
Did you wanna be alone?
Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
...Something like that. Yeah.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
You're famous around here.
You know my name.
Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
Yes.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
Kiss me.
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
Care for some saki?
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
May I wash you?
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
Come in.
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
You may.
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
Kiss me.
I love you, Austin.
I have something to tell you.
I'll secure the perimeter.
Austin, I'm coming with you.
Are you crazy?
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
Likewise.
Oh, behave!
Austin, what's your point?
I'll hurry back.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
What do we do now?
Shut up.
Yes.
Indeed.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
Not now, Austin.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
You know who.
Do you think she's prettier than I?
I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Not in the Nineties.
No, did you use a condom?
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
Austin, may I have a word with you?
Really, Austin!
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
I am not.
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
Why?
I haven't had fun like that since college.
Go! Just go!
Watch out, you're on my hair!
I couldn't have another bite.
I hate having my picture taken.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
I don't get it.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Let's go get him!
How do you know?
A limousine has just pulled up.
Why?
Do you want to talk to him?
Why did you leave so soon?
Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
Here, use mine.
I'm sure.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
What?
Sure.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
A Chigro?
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
I'm sorry?
Excuse me?
I beg your pardon?
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
My mother's told me all about you.
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
Did you ever want to?
Did you ever...
I just don't see it.
What about his teeth?
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
Why?
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
He's asleep.
Great.
Would that I could say the Same.
So I'm still ...
How long have I been here?
... love ...
... love ...
... love...
... preserve...
... power ...
... death ...
... death ...
Knight ...
... head ...
... bottle ...
Sir August...?  What now?
Promised? Who promised?
Have we met?
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
Really -- what happened in 1922?
I have an appointment.
As you see.
Impossible?
Mr. John Steed, please.
Then who wins?
Rules are made to be broken.
This isn't a game.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
Quite a collection.
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
Thank you, Steed.
Next assignment?
So am I.
To find out who killed my husband.
Who?
The Institute ... the funding ...
To you ... ?
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
What are you trying to do to me?
Watch me.
I resign.
After the cold war ...
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
He tried to warn us ...
Ropes?
How curious ...
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
Hmmm ...
I'll never marry you.
Choices?
What are my choices?
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
Then what's stopping you?
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
The result would be ...
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
Such as?
Entirely. On the other hand  Mad people get things done. Let me show you --
You're mad.
That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...
Ring?
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Valentine, listen to me ...
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.
I'm already married ...
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ...
'Our revels now are ended.'
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
But -- why?
Of course. I planned that, too.
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
Too many cooks --
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
You killed my husband.
An unholy trinity ...
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
You.
Thanks, Valentine ...
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Pity your mother came, too ...
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
Have you any place in mind?
Still a bit chilly ...
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
What kept you?
If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
But --
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
Where are you going?
Have a look at this.
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
Trubshaw again? What now?
Shall we?
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
What is it?
It's called Black Leather.
Have we been invited?
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
Aren't you coming?
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
No idea who. No idea why ...
You lied.
As far as you trust me.
No, after you.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
I'm playing to win.
I thought you played by the rules.
You're playing games.
But you did suspect me.
Is that all?
Mmm ... what are you doing?
It wasn't me; you have my word.
And do you trust me?
Yes ... ?
Because you always obey orders ...
I could save you the trouble.
To kill me?
You followed me.
It was Peter -- I saw him ...
Was I?
Where am I?
Steed ... !
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
This must be the last straw.
Barely.
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
Is that what you think?
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
Three agents killed by bad weather...
That's what we were working on.
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Not quite. This is my field.
But
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
She had this in her mouth. There, there...
Is that written in his shoe?
Any ideas?
Very good, Steed ...
How on earth can you tell?
I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
You mean my other self ...
Did you say formal? I must dress.
No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
Any other vices?
June, July ... August?
An eccentric recluse?
No thanks.
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
And I suppose you're the knight.
But why? What's the point?
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
Steed, we really must be --
Or half cocked.
I thought we were on our way.
Do you?
I had a feeling you would. Touche!
My father always wanted a boy.
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
Mother?
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
And just what is the game?
Rules are made to be broken.
Whereas you are.
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
1922. Why the kippers?
I had a spot of bother at the door.
And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
Decontamination -- ?
You don't believe him?
Where's Mother?
You're saying I have no choice.
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
I shall need a small plane.
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
... and now?
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
I fail to see --
Getting to what?
Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
Who's now vanished.
Surveillance? By whom?
I know all this.
Peter's brother?  But --
I see.
Ugh ...
Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for --
Aren't you forgetting about something?
You said ... one shot.
If you say so.
That's not playing by the rules.
You wish.
But did they teach you this?
You're better than I expected.
The last one you'll ever see.
John Steed.
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
You're kidding.
What do you mean?
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
I'm going now, Cole.
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
No, Cole, I...
Cole, we've got to talk.
Cole?
You're so romantic...
Yeah.
Let's get naked.
Yes...
I don't believe you.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
Let go of me!
Rick, you're lying!
I can't trust you!
Why don't you get undressed.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
I love you.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
Your mother's not dead.
You're really pissing me off.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Can't I just go with you guys?
Gonna get married...
You better not have too much joy.
Um... that's very relaxing.
That feels so great.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
I don't know... I just feel scared.
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
I can't sleep.
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Are you going to have women at your party?
It looks awful.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
I think your dinner's burning.
What are we having?
God, you're a slob.
Ilene, are you crazy?
Let's go.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Ilene, Rick promised...
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
I hope those guys are all right.
Quiet, Mother.
Ilene, we don't really know that.
Why is Cole here?
Great, Mom.
It's a small town.
I don't have the slightest idea...
I quit two days ago, Brian.
That's a dumb thing to say.
Just take it.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
I don't know anything about it.
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
Hi.
You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
I was doing my job.
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
Brian. What's wrong?
Uh huh.
Then why did you quit?
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
Homey.
Got anything to drink in there?
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
You think that's really any of your business?
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Hi.
I could use a date.
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
How's it going?
Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
When I was twenty.
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.
I work for city hall.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Huh.
Thanks for calling.
You're back.
Brian.
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
Four months?
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
You look like... Brian.
Brian?
I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
What's wrong?
You can't keep being his father...
Yeah? When was the last time?
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
You want some coffee?
You treated me like shit.
Okay.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
The great communicator.
-- You remember.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
He's going to be a fireman.
He's got piano lessons.
It's not your roof anymore.
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Here we go...
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
"The Strawberries"?
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
Who?
Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?
Then c'mere. I got something for you.
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
Who?
Why?
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
It's nothing. This is New York, man...  Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money!
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
That's mighty black of you.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
You don't have the demographics.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
Delacroix.
Please.
Who are you revolting against?
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
Well you did.
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
Don't make me have to use this.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
Work related or otherwise?
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
That's why it will be so much fun.
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
Please don't go there.
He's just playing big brother.
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
I don't want to hear it.
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
I thought it was appropiate.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
A gift.
So you have your small victory, now what?
Everybody shut up.
I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
The pleasure is mine.
Just don't lie to me.
We both lied to him.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
Break a leg.
You've said that already.
The big one.
This is the group I was telling you about.
Hello.
Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do?
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
What is your problem?
You okay?
Hello.
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
I'm in till the end.
Sounds risky to me.
What point is that?
You lost me.
Do you know how you will use him?
The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
Manray!
It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
Nobody told me anything.
How was it?
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
You know how your Daddy is.
No.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
Peerless, last time, go see your father.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
Regardless, he still is your father.
Richmond is not all the way down south.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
Yes he did.
He wants you to come and see him.
Peerless, your father called.
I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
How's the food?
I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
What do you mean?
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
You've never had any formal training, either?
You can go now.
Why don't you answer?
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
Say what, Manray?
Just ask me what you want to know.
And what?
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
What?
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
You're sure this is a good idea.
Why don't you call him?
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up.  They had no choice.  They were considered 3/5ths of a human being.  Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States?
Maybe you need to start.
You don't read, do you?
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
Oh you do, huh?
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
Are you trying to rap to me?
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
What do you want to know?
Enough.
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
Old fool!
Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
You want my heart?
How so?
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
Not one.
Not even that.
Never.
No.
How do you know that?
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
Where's the cabin?
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Back up.
What about the phosphorous grenade?
Where?
What business?
He said he worked there --
Epilepsy.
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
He was your friend.
Your phone number?
Yeah.
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
Nah.
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
What are you doing out here?
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past.
You're a good man, Hardy.
That's not true.
What if I don't want it?
This isn't the time --
What?
We need to talk --
No bodies, no West...
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
Hardy, what are you doing --
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
Four --
No.
We were close to something with Kendall.
For what?
You know, you never told me why you left the army.
Think it'll work?
So what now?
So did I.
You wanted to break him.
You mean the falsely accused?
You wanted to get the truth.
You couldn't have known --
See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
Good idea.
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
They got their stories straight.
Little bit.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
Buttfucks the cabin?
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
Dunbar.
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
What?
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
But you will.
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
I don't know.
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
I don't think that has anything to do with --
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
That was kid gloves?
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
Not the happiest of memories?
Something wrong?
What point?
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
You're off to a late start.
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
You're kidding.
Something like that. You?
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
What is that?
We're in the middle of a murder case --
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
You made me look like an idiot --
Baseball?
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.
Good cop/bad cop?
That is the most unprofessional --
Excuse me?
Why?
Yes.
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
You and the Colonel go back.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
You knew Sergeant West?
Hostile and uncooperative.
What happened with Nunez?
So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
Who, Levi --
Wrong answer --
What.
Enjoy your flight to Washington --
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
Dunbar says you were.
Pike never confessed.
Fifty minutes.
Pike never confessed.
But you didn't see it, right?
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
No one else heard it?
He said what?
He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
We just want --
So?
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
Yeah.
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
What happens to Dunbar now?
We know.
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
It's too neat.
No --
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
He's not Army, it's not official --
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
This is totally unnecessary --
Lucky girl.
I know.
Go.
Please. Go. Just go.
It's okay, just leave it.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
So I've heard.
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
You must be Edward Bloom.
Promise me you'll come back.
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
How old are you?
It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
Was she nekkid?
What did she look like?
I like your stories.
You were talking about your wedding.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
I never knew.
Please?
Can I take your picture?
Stop.
No, I understand.
That's terrible.
What were you dreaming about?
Hi. How are you feeling?
Really.
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
How can I convince you to stop?
You don't even know me.
How did you get so many?
Daffodils?
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
I'm sorry.
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
I wasn't expecting you.
Oh. Oh.
I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking.
I do.
Do you like it, being pregnant?
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
I need to lie down for a bit.
I'm going to check on him.
I'll help you.
I'm going to get started on dishes.
We'll have to pick up a copy.
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it.
Yes.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
You're not.
But it's not true.
Do you love him?
Do you love your father?
Mmm, what?
But it's romantic.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
You never told me how your parents met.
I talked with your father last night.
I'm going with you.
I'm going with you.
You need to go.
It's bad.
Yes. Thank you.
That's okay?
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
Yes?
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
Do you know who that is?
Was she one of your teachers?
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
No it's not. It's exactly the same. Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level. Just the same as you two.
Would you say you understand Josephine?
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Yes.
Of course.
Really! That's wonderful.
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
He's up with your father.
You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
How did you get here?
No I haven't.
Leave him!
What are you doing here?
Name it.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
Say thank you.
Do you like it?
It is. I did it cooking.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
Yes.
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
It's enough isn't it?
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
My name's Sophia.
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
Maybe you will find out.
Tell me about it.
It's more like a date.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
It's what you came back for.
It's not mine.
I'm sorry.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
Something else.
Goodbye.
Please. Why not?
Okay. Thank you.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
You know you can come under the blanket.
What was her name?
Except for Small Eyes.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
I'm trying to quit.
She's alive!! She is not dead?
She's alive?
What?
I'm sorry.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
What happened between you and the blonde?
Not really. Maybe a little.
No.
No.
I don't have nothing.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
I wasn't saying anything.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
You are throwing me out.
Excuse me?
You don't understand you either.
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
You didn't mind too much.
You...
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
So now you hate all women?
Why?
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
Sometimes neither.
Sometimes.
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
And who says what is wrong.
And? What are you saying?
I don't hate you.
We'll pretend it never happened.
Okay we won't talk about it.
You don't want to talk about it.
Why not?
No. But you tend to tie them up.
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
He will come back.
But, you know, so what?
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
It's none of your business.
I don't want to talk about him.
I said I don't have any.
I don't have any money.
Yes.
What?
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
Where's the restroom?
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
So you're just going to be vindictive
I know you just want to punish me --
No I don't.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
So what are you going to do?
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
You don't understand anything.
They go.
They go.
They go. John. They go.
"Frenzy".
Syevodnya
Happy bath day.
Today is bath day.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Then start taking them seriously.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
What are you doing?
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
More cough syrup?
What do you need?
Hey.
When? Now? Oh. No.
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
I put on the lotion you got me. Can you smell it?
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
I bet you have loyal customers.
This was very sweet of you.
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
You didn't have to do this.
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
Not if no one finds out.
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
Is your niece older than 12?
You take her to a doctor?
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
Yes?
Well. It's good to see you.
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
Lazarus?
Okay.
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Hi.
You don't got half what Tehronne got.
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
I got others.
Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
You go to hell.
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
Yeah.
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
I begged him not to go. And he did.
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
LAZ, I said let...!
Let go of my arm...
Let go...
I don't love ya no more.
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
Better than what you give.
I deserve better than this.
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
How many times we been over this, Laz? How many times?
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
I don't want you to let go.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
What I love.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
Don't know where I learn't it, but... it's there in my head.
Sorry.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
I guess you have.
Are you drunk?  Keep drinkin' water and you won't get a headache in the mornin'.
By myself?
Nothin'.
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
Where you gonna be?
You think God forgives people like that?  You think God forgives people like me?
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
The... chain helps.
I'm here with you.
Could you do somethin' for me?
I ain't in a hurry.
Still makin' jokes?
We drinkin' buddies now?
Sure.
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
I can handle that.
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
I don't fuckin' cook.
Uh-uh.
Let go of me...
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
Uh-uh.
Itches.
Uh-uh.
If I break one you gonna shoot me?
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
I CAN'T!
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
Or what?
LET ME GO!
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
You some kind'a pervert?
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
What do you want?
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
What?
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
The fuck you been doin' to me?
Why you got me chained?
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
Wait. He left.
Where's Ronnie?
Two days?
How long... how long I been out?
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
Teh... Tehronne?
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
You a preacher?
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
Thank you.
Ronnie...
Ronnie. Please, baby...
I feel better. Do you?
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
Holy shit!
Are you wasted?
Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
You don't gotta get up but... I gotta go...
Hey.
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
This ain't gonna work.
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
Now see? Don't do that. I'll go along with all you say about me. But that... you can't pretend no more on that. Cuz I was just a kid, Momma.  I didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me.  And you let him do it. Some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY you had.
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
I just wanted some make-up.
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
Got in a little accident.
Didn't know you was workin' here now?
The hell you call me?
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
Stolen phone cards and two-ways is what you sayin'.
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
You got any money?
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
I still think you're a bastard.
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
You'll get Ich killed.
The cheese...
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
They want your autograph.
I don't remember saying yes.
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
You met her.
He's got a reason.
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
And I'm supposed to care?
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
Where's Ich?
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
I paid for that.
Don't be an ass.
She ever pull down her shades?
I don't think so.
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
You have a helluva way of asking for help.
I don't give tours.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
Ich said you left.
He gets as much as he wants.
I want to do it.
I think, therefore I am.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
Tomorrow, he says.
He's not ready yet.
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
You know what I think?
What difference will it make?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Ten years.
Uh-huh.
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
You're sick, Deckard.
This feels stupid.
But then how can you...
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
They could clean around the arrangement.
It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
That's another thing I can't do.
Did you cry when your father died?
I wish I could.
Do you dream?
What do people do in the afternoon?
How are you doing?
How come you're not on the job?
Oh.
Where is he?
Who is this?
You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping.
I told you I'd come back.
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
What do you want me to do?
They probably want to find out when they were made.
Can you?  I couldn't.
I'm sorry.
Do I make you nervous?
So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
You use your equipment, don't you?
Two of us might be more effective than one.
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
I think you need more help than you've got.
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
Ugh.
It would be my child.
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
I'd never get an abortion.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
I'd kill it.
I'd take him to the doctor.
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
For the responsibility of your power.  Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.
Are you apprehensive?
Of course not.
But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard?
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
What makes you think so?
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
Is that why you're still here?
What's that?
What's your problem?
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Thanks.
Just better.
Whatcha doin'?
I was hoping you'd say that.
I'm hungry, J.F.
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
They left.
I don't have one.
Hi.
Pris.
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
No.
...I do.
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
Neat. Goodnight!
Really?  Okay!
My pleasure.
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
Uh-huh. Adam?
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
Sing it to me.
Is that what you call it?
There.
Well, you had better!!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
Goodnight!
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
I'm leaving, too.
I don't blame you!
Adam?!
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
Did you?
What?
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
No way.
What have you ordered?
And don't be so obvious!
Not that one!
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
Yes!
No!  Not crazy!
Look unimpressed.
Well...yeah. Okay.
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
Yeah.
That's boring!
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
So, what are you seeing?
Uh...yeah.
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
Sure.
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
What?!
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
Yes!
I was wrong!!
Never drive again!
You almost got us killed!
Stop that ma'am crap!
Now, get out!!
Get out!
Thank you.
Could we talk about that a little later?
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
When do you need her by?
No dogs, huh? Okay.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
Everybody's divorced.
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
Sure.
The big one!
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Why?!
What for?
A wife?
Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Name it.
Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Thank you.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
Night!
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
What?
Very funny, smart ass.
Who are these people?
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
Sure.
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
What's the pay?
How long would you need me?
Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
Doing what?
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
What?
See, ya.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
No.
Okay!  Damn!
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
Why are you doing that?
Take it. damn it!
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
I know a short-cut.
You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
Over this?
How's that?
Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
Perry?
What is it?!
Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
And that's it?
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
Rogers Hornsby?!?
Get away from me!!
Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
You don't?
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Yes, I'm right?
Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Here, pick these up!
What's wrong with you?
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
You're lost?
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
No, you get out of here.
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
Are you French?
No.
Well, where are you --
This is your bedroom?
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
What?
A psychiatrist?!
Are you in trouble, son?!
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
Yes?
I just hope this is still good up there.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
You're my brave boy.
I'm afraid you've got to.
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
Elbows, Son.
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
Oh, my God!
What can I offer you, Eve?
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
How long will you set it for this time?
Amen.
Yes, dear, I know.
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
I want him to at least see the sky!
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
Excuse me.
We do?
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
I don't believe it!
No.
Mutants?!
Yes! That's right!
Yes, yes it is!
Just open the door.
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
Would you excuse me?
Yes...
Let's eat our cake.
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
What did you wish for, Adam?
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
Get the presents and do the lights.
Calvin!
Hi.
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Watch this!
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Why?
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Calvin?!
If I...you know...
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
What shall we call him?
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Oh, no.
You have tranquilizers?
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
I'm not hungry.
All our friends...
No.
To go up.
It's safe.
Thirty -five years!
The locks?
What's that noise?
To you maybe.
As long as we've got that straight.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Days??
How long will we have to stay down here?
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
Yes.
I never know anymore.
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
Well, put it down and come in!
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
Stop it, you two!
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
So where is your roommate, the model?
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
You came back for these?
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
What are you doing here?
Stop!
Adam!!
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
Come on.
What?!
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
Then what?
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
Have him committed.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
We'll find him.
Give it back to him.
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
Gay.
Oh, no!
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
Coward!
You're goddamn right I am!
Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
What?!!
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
Where did he get all that information?
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
What?
Or have perfect table manners.
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!
To bed?
Where are you going?
Those sluts!
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Who did he leave with?
What's that mean?
He go back to the hotel?
Go to the bathroom.
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Just be yourself.
That water's freezing!
No.
I think...it...works.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
Well, that's blunt!
What's that supposed to mean?
Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
Give me your hand.
I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
I knew you'd like him.
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Hold me, Don.
Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
They hurt his head.
My secret lover.
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
No.  Hi baby.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
I want you to stay with me.
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
I did. Are you?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
I love you Don with all my heart.
Just get outta my bed.
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
I asked first.
Do you love me?
Kiss me.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Beeeee careful.
Does that scare you?
Frank would open you.
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
You like to open me, don't you?
No police!!!  No police!!
I want you to hurt me.
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
Are you a bad boy?
What do you want to do?
Do you like my body?
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Yes. Frank--
It used to make me laugh, but.
Come in.
Please, please stay.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Don? Are you in with them?
Falling.
Look.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Who's it, you mean.
I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
Oh shit.
I liked being with you last night.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
Yeah, hurry up though.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
You don't?
Do you know?
I made it go down the toilet.
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
Do you like me?
You can hit me, if you want to.
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
See my nipples?
See my breasts? See?
Do you like the way I feel?
Thank you. honey.
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
Don?
Sure I'm alright.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Lie down on the bed.
Do you like talk like that?
Do you like that?
What do you want?
What do you want from me?
No way.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
THEN WHAT?
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
Shit. You better tell me something.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Yeah.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Yes? What is it?
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Oh he forced you, huh?
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Alright, suit yourself.
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Frank, he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. Come on. He didn't mean it.
If you want to.
Those are my breasts.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Yes, but.
Frank?
Where are we going, Frank?
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
Mommy's here.
Hello, daddy.
Hello, baby.
Look Jeffrey.
No Jeffrey!!
Go ahead!
Go ahead.
Jeffrey? What's going on?
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
Probably not. No. Why?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Dorothy Vallens?
No.
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Okay.
Just a minute.
NO.
Really?
You want to dance?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
It's okay.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
It's good to see you.
What was that all about?
What is it?
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
You didn't tell him about me?
Everything okay?
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
You like mysteries that much?
Jeffrey? Why?
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Jeffrey!!
Oh yeah?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Shoot.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
What am I going to do?
You were late.
Goodnight.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay, be careful.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Who, me? Why should it?
Yeah?
Did you see her undressed?
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
You saw a lot in one night.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You want to tell me about it?
You want a Dairy Queen?
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
He got a little jealous.
What did you see?
Well, how did it go? What happened?
Okay, okay. Bye.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Okay, yeah, call.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
OK.
Yeah, but.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
I'll drink to that.
That sounds good.
This is not my usual Friday night!
Brilliant.
What's the plan.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
You really want to do this, don't you?
Yes. I do.
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
So, what's next?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
Are you alright?
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Alright.
You've got a point there.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Now, how are you going to do that?
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
I'm here, aren't I?
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
I don't know.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I've gotta go in.
What happened to him?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Maybe so.
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
That's too bad.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Terrible boring.
Yes.
Am I bothering you?
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
Stop it Mike.
Okay.
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
You can change it if you want to.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
No. You lost your way.
No good options left?
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
'Why' would be enough for me.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
I'm sorry, Ward.
Don't know.
Did he say anything to you?
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
Sorry to wake you.
Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission.  I want the Berlin police fully briefed and --  -- get this out to all the agencies.
So what's he doing? You believe him?
Don't you want answers?
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
May I finish?
Excuse me.
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
...this is Conklin's computer.
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off.  They were killed by Jason Bourne.
And Bourne? Where's he now?
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
I want to know what happened.
Let's talk about Conklin.
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
I want to know about Treadstone.
That's not gonna fly.
Treadstone.
Is this really happening?
Because you're afraid!
I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
YOU'RE A LIAR!
You're a liar.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
You killed them.
Then what?
Yes...
What?
No, I do.
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
Okay.
I speak English.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
You do?
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
But you found another choice.
I love you, too.
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
There must be another way!
What if it's not who you think it is?
Where are you going?
-- hang on --
-- it's just him? --
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
-- where? -
What?
-- where's left to go? --
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
Where --
That's crazy.
So...
But you're sure?
But we were so careful.
No... How?
One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You and me.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
Sleep. Sleep now.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
I worry when you get like this.
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
-- it hasn't been two years --
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
I'll get the book.
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
...it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!...
No... Jason... please...
You never worked Berlin...
Your first assignment was Geneva.
No. You never worked Berlin.
What do you mean?
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin!
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
And you got to him before we could.
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
What is this, a game?
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
You hear me? I believed you.
I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
Yes.
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
Sounds like a threat.
Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
Are you disappointed?
Careful...
Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
Okay, Jason, your move.
Who?
Okay, how do you want to do it?
What do you want?
Bourne?
What? The tapes?
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
This stays between you and I.  We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
Alright... take it down.
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
-- the hotel -- how far? --
-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
Who's going? Us?
And the Germans can't match it?
We need to get in there.
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
That's where we came out.
Felt promising. It's a start.
So?
Let's give him half an hour.
Alright...
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
What do you think? Is he coming in?
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
Is it fresh?
Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
And why is that?
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from.
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
Some women like Dobermans --
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
Did you?
You mean, did I want a date?
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
If you say so.
So he fooled you.
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
Believed what?
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
Are you an expert in amnesia?
Am I a doctor, no, but...
I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
Good luck.
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
Amnesia?
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
What kind of problems?
And what about you, anything?
Are we hacking or asking?
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
By who?
Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
Are we locked up?
Anything?
What the hell is a "Treadstone?"
Do we know what this says?
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou great king... and win the respect of your own people.
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
When will his trial be?
Is it true? Wallace is captured?
Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.
Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way.
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
Good day to you, M'Lords.
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
No, M'lord.
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
Scotland. He intends --
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace. So grant them.
I have faced him. Have you?
Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
Humbly, M'lord.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
No. He did not.
Shall I leave, M'lord?
Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
...Tonight!
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
You scare me.
Nor I!
I... accept your proposal!
Did it work?
You've been here before?
You are. And I'll come again.
Thank you for inviting.
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
Wake up, William. Wake up!
And I with you. But you must wake.
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
...I wouldn't know.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
How do you know this?
I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
You will die! It will be awful!
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?
You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
It does me good to see you.
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
Peace is made is such ways.
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
That is not possible.
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
I am the Princess of Wales.
What?
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
What is it?
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
No dances, just tell me.
So what did you find.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
How soon?...
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
But you must have something to go on?
And the bad news?
Why? What for?
Anything.
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
Just. Like. Jason.
How. Did you. Know that?
You're. Acting. Like your father.
Fix?
What does that mean for Evan?
Cute, Evan.
Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
I found these. The others are still in storage.
I don't know. These things take time.
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
Why do you ask?
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
Something must've happened! What set him off?
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
Honey. What were you doing with that?
Great. I'll see you soon.
That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
You know the answer to that.
Darn it!
Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
Is something the matter?
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
Sure you don't want your wallet?
There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.
There's one major hole in your story.
Know what?
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Oh? There's proof now?
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
Because you're... different.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
What's happened to you?
Ha! Where's that?
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Are you okay?
My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
Why are you doing all this for me?
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
I don't understand, where are you taking me?
As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
Those are your clothes, silly.
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
It was a long time ago.
What do you want to know, Evan?
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
Of course.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
Not if you remember my dad.
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
I've stopped a hundred times.
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
Hi, Lenny.
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
I deserve a lot worse.
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
Ouch.
You really don't remember anything that happened?
Oh God... what did we do?
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
Shut up, Tommy!
Oh my God oh my God...
I'm sorry.
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
Monsieur Rick, I --
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Oh, yes, please.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
-- Will he keep his word?
Yes, Monsieur.
Oh, yes.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of course, he's losing.
He did. Captain Renault did.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
No.
My husband is with me, too.
I came with Captain Renault.
Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
Monsieur Rick?
And the other alternative?
What are they?
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
Occupied France?
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
You needn't be concerned about me.
Yes.
And I said I would never leave you.
But what about us?
No.
But Richard, no, I, I --
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
I don't understand. What about you?
But why my name, Richard?
Oh, Rick!
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
I wish I didn't love you so much.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
For the last time, put them on the table.
Put them on the table.
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
Please.
Richard, I had to see you.
The stairs from the street.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
You can believe that if you want to.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Yes.
It doesn't matter.
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
I don't know the finish yet.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
I didn't count the days.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
Please.
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
Oh, darling!
That's too far ahead to plan.
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
Yes, of course, we --
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
Strange. I know so very little about you.
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Why there is no other man in my life?
Yes?
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
A franc for your thoughts.
We said "no questions."
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
No.
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Does he always leave so early?
When will he be back?
Where is Rick?
Some of the old songs, Sam.
It's been a long time.
Hello, Sam.
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
Be careful.
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
No, Victor, there isn't.
Yes, Victor, I was.
-- Yes?
Ask me?
Did he give any reason?
Yes?
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
What happened with Rick?
He does. Could we have a table close to him?
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
No, Victor, no.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Be careful.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
You are very kind.
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
You're saying this only to make me go.
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
Hello, Rick.
-- Is what?
Rick? Who's he?
Yes.
Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
I'm so glad you're alive.
I love you, Chuck.
I had to come.  To be sure you were okay.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
What will you do?
You okay?
This is so unfair.
You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
Come on.  Try.
Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
Yeah?
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
What's that, written on the sail?
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
What's that?
No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS truck.  Can you believe it?
Her name's Hannah.
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
If I'd known you were alive --
I would never --
I got married.
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango to the frogs.
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
Get back?  From where?
Don't even start.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.
I burned the Christmas tree.
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
There isn't any us.
That's your dog.
No.
"We're" not over-reacting.
This isn't working out.
You want to.
You can't go now.
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
For when I travel?
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
He's your cute thing.
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
Let me guess, Russia came up?
You don't seem too happy about it.
Merry Christmas eve.
Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it.
Chuck.
Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
How was Russia?
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
Sonofabitch!
Dr. Homer Wells.
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
These *credentials* are against the law!
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
He'll need clothes... some money...
They just want you to hire some new help.
It was just the ether, Wilbur...
Then I wasn't beautiful.
You weren't dreaming about me.
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
It claims to restore monthly regularity.
Only if you can afford it.
Good night, Daddy.
Daddy, *please*...
Good night, Daddy.
Wally said to say, "Hello."
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
It's time somebody ate *them*.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
Do you think she'll be all right?
You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
Please don't...
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
Please don't make me say it again.
What do you want me to *do*?
He's *paralyzed*!
For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down!
Stop it! Just cut it out!
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
Nothing.
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
You don't understand! It's her father...
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Well, we have to help her!
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
It will be okay.
I *know* this was right.
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
The *speaker*. For the movie sound.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
Just a little privacy.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
You don't miss it?
At least you were never lonely.
What are you so crazy about the movies for?
Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
But you looked as if you liked it.
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
So. Not bored yet?
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
Burma!
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
Really?
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
Two.
Candy. Candy Kendall.
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
Why?
I can't go nowhere.
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
Yes, I *have*!
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago.  I've been through this.
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
Hi...
Hi...
Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
How is that Wally doing?
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
I know what you've been doing.
I love you, Wally.
There! You said it was boring.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
Wally thinks apples are boring.
No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.
I'm okay--I can walk.
So many children. Are they all orphans?
It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been *wonderin'* about it!
That's *it*?
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
Not yet. What do you know about it?
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
I can't read. Nobody taught me.
So what?
What you got a picture of your heart for?
What's that?
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
What's lucky about that?
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
So what? We just stay clear of him.
I'm going home
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
No, I want my cut!
You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.
You got my cell. Leave a message.
Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
No, I want my cut!
What about the money?
What about...
Everyone's working an angle, right?
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
Jesus... Take it easy.
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
After Glenn was finished, he gave me a couple of valiums and I went home. The next day, I finished my shift and met him around back, like we always did. I stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest. Three or four times.
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
Sort of. I was telling him about this great love of my life who's name I don't remember, and I could see... He was getting pissed. I thought it was just because he was worried about me, but... He told me that I was stupid because my boyfriend didn't really love me.
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
WHAT?
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
How do you know I will?
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
It's more than that.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
Do you have something to prove?
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
Look at you... You want to go.
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
Did I miss something?
You told me to change my hair!
Lighten up.
I gotta go get a haircut.
He's gone.
Uh... Everything okay?
Then show me how.
You're just going to have to trust me.
Why?
What?
It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to worry?
What the hell's his problem?
Mr. King, I think --
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
What about Customs?
What do I have to do?
No.  What's my cut?
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
Says who?
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.
That's not --
What is this? You guys cops or something?
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
You're all scumbags.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
Sorry.
Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit!
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
Well it is. But I know where I am.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
I got scared.
But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.  No blow jobs. No screwing.
All men are cheats.
You're shaking.
I'll take you up on that.
My car's in the garage.
Jack. Do you need a ride?
How do I look?
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
I'm Bella.
How can anyone be that naive?
What?
Why did you take the money?
You're already alone.
Here...use a spoon.
Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple.
Nothing about you.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
Really?
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
You were talking in your sleep.
You will?
It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
I hope it brings you luck.
No. Answer it!
The door, Jack.
Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
I don't like it.
Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
What do I mean to you? I want to know. Tell me.
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
Are you drunk?
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
I loved it blond.
Poor baby.  This'll relax you.
You're shaking. What is it?
How did it go?
What's the time?
You've got such beautiful hands.
I love you Jack, you know that.
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
How did you land that?
What job?
I want to hear it.
You're my prisoner.
Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
Where did you get it?
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
I won't be that long.
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
I couldn't resist them.
Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you...
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
Jack! It's Jani.
It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
Would you like a drink?
I took the bandage off yesterday.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
Do you?
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
Thank you.
Is it yes?
I have to take the car.
I'm sorry.
I told you, all bets are off.
Let it go.
No, forget it. The bet's off.
I want you to forget what I said.
I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend.
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
Next time it'll be my neck.
These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
It won't.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
The point is, they want a man inside.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
They mean it.
Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.
I know that. But you can now.
I owe a lot of money.
I'm in trouble.
I didn't.
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
Which side do you like?
You don't like cheats, do you.
What happened?
He doesn't gamble.
That's fine.
Just an accident. Nothing.
Toss you for it.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
Do you believe in astrology?
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
Near the casino.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
To coincidence.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
Well, thank you anyway.
You know where I'm from?
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
She was there...
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
You mean until you showed up?
I understand.
Okay, okay.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
Let go of my hand.
Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
You're also a fool.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
Oh?
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
A friend of your fiance's.
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
Only one I can think of.
So are dogs.
Please...
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
Unlikely.
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
Where?
More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
How long you and me known each other?
You know what I'm saying.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
What?
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
Yeah.
What was his name?
What happened?
Hi... what's going on here?
Is that a cellar door?
Who's Frank?
Why? Is this about the book?
Where are we going?
What?
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
My mom is gone.
Hey.
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
What's wrong with you?
What? How long was I asleep?
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
Infant Memory Generators.
Maybe she's asleep.
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
Who?
Are you okay?
What?
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
You want to kiss me...
And what?
Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
What happened to your neck?
Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Donnie?
And you'd never been there before?
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
I'm going home.
Sure.
Where are we going?
That was a compliment.
You're weird.
Why is that?
Until it withers away.
Wonder where we'll be then.
You mean soap?
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
Fuck them.
Don't look so freaked.
Wanna walk me home?
Hey...
I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
I gotta work with these women.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
Loretta, don't do that.
I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a...
Airport Ho-Jo!
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
This came for you, sweetie.
I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
Okay.
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
Really?
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
What is wrong with you?
...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...
Thank God for bunge cords.
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
Loretta, never have kids.
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
My mom wanted me to have this?
You-betcha.
Really, Loretta?
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
Oh-yah.
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
Yeah, you betcha...
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
So, what do I say?
Oh God, I'm dead...
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
You're what?!
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
She's right over there.
Where is she?!
She's alive, sweetie.
Is Mom okay?
Yah?
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Your parents'd kill you.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
But, you -- I mean... It's not my fault. I -- I... Please? I didn't do anything wrong...
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Mrs. Leeman?
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
I'm gonna need more caps.
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
-- red nose and ears. I know, I know.
Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
It's okay.
We was robbed.
Bye mom.
I love you much.
C'mere. I love you so much.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
That's it, I'm goin'...
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.
Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
Ow!
What?!
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
Mom!
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
Go on! Get out!
Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
Oh... How quickly they grow up.  Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first.
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
Oh shit!
That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!
This, this... This is bullshit!
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
I hate her!
No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
Bitch!
Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds.
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
I just did.
You heard me. Where is it?
What're you doin' here?
Yes, Leslie!
Yes...
Yeah...
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
Here, I didn't get any.
Bye.
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
I know.
Then it must be Wednesday.
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
Hi.
They told me to practice.
Annette, just use your hand.
Okay. Take her purse.
We was robbed.
Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit.
Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant!  If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU!
Anyone?
Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
So? Be real easy.
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
I got a hairdo.
You don't know where this is gonna...
All right, they're makin' a movie.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
I'll be right back. See ya later.
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
"Most smartest?" Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. "Most smartest." We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
Oh, Christ, it's true.
Shut it up, Loretta.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Loretta, shut it.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall."  You guys want a beer?
This here's Loretta.
Oh, naw. Hi.
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
Hi.
Hi.
You could be quiet.
Are we on "Cops" again?
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
I've always thought that myself.
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
Oh?
One or two?
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
Oh Frederick.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
More romances for John?
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
And here are my mother and father.
Do you?
Well, these things take time.
I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
What do you mean?
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
Did it go well, darling?
You won't be long?
Welcome home, John.
Well...
A dressing bag?
Very smart indeed.
Yes sir.  What's that?
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
Watery headed bunch.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
Won't come out, eh?
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
The workhouse.
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
I've heard.
Fine.
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
But, Father, it IS!
It's your fantasy...
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....
You're losing your temper!
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
There IS no one.
Who, Father?
Ah! It's my father!
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
Then I shall come too.
No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
Erik! You've done what you came to do!
The second note.
Then let go!
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
Do you believe I love you?
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
But you don't realize....
Erik. You don't understand.
No!
Why?
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
But, Erik...
Who?
You're as bad as my father.
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
Oh, for goodness' sake!
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
I've never LOVED anybody!
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
But you LOVED her all the same...
What was she like?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
But surely you know...?
WHY?
Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
Those things in your hands.
Please! Please! What are those?
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
I said welcome.
Why should you care?
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
What a stupid idea.
Why... should YOU care?
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
Aaagh! Rape!
Ah.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Well you started it.
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
You DON'T like it, do you?
About raping me?
What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
What?
Oh, get it over with.
What -- rape?
You don't love ME.
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
What about the raping?
Looting and pillaging, eh?
Have you done this sort of thing before?
Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
You did? You liked me?
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
Here we are.
Okay, I guess.
How are you today?
Hi.
Ms. Kruczynski?
Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you.
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
May I help you?
What's wrong with me?
It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
I'm so excited. Yay!
Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
Come up to Boston with me?
Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
In the room?
You rat.
Come over after I'm done here?
You were not.
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
Okay, I guess.
I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
Doesn't sound like me.
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
A bully? Moi?
Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
Well, you obviously don't know me.
I'm nervous, too.
Hey, Joel --
That's okay. I --
Oh, um...
Make love?
Joel, come here. Please.
What if?
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
When?
So you'll call me, right?
Bye, Joel.
Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
What if you stay this time?
So go.
No, it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
It's freezing out here.
Cool.
At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
Male or female?
Oh.
Let's move into this neighborhood.
I wish we did. You married?
Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live.
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
Yeah, maybe.
I think, before.
Me too. There's this poem --
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
What do we do?
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
Yeah, like that.
Oh God, how horrid.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
Hi there.
Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
I know.
Probably.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Well, you're married.
Yeah?
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
Is that what you want?
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
Come up and see me... now.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
But you weren't. I could tell.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
Egad, were you horrified?
What was I wearing?
Naomi, I guess.
This is our first "date" date.
Yeah.
I love it!
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
Joel!
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
Really? Is he cute?
What?
-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
You remember what happened next?
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
I'm right here.
Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.
What if you hide me?
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
Oh?
Such a beautiful view.
It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
Joely...
More?
Joel, you're a liar.
I want to know you.
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
Would you get me another, Joely?
It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
What?!
You're not ready.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
I want to have a baby.
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
How can you watch this crap?
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Yo ho ho!
You didn't say anything about my hair.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
When?
You'll call me, right?
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
Okay.
You should stay.
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
Yeah? Oh, great!
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy...
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
I know a man who needs a refill.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
You pick it.
Ready for another?
Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows. I think I used to be a crow.
You like that?
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that.  Anyway. See Ya.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry.  Me.
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
So you like bookstores, huh?
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
You know Wilmont?
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
Yeah?
I don't want to take you out of your way.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
Joel? It's Joel, right?
Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Huckleberry Hound?
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
Yeah, I got it.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Oh. So...
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Really?
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
Why?
'Night.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
I'm glad you called.
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
I'm sorry.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
Yeah.
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
How was it?
Hi.
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
What?
So what's going on, Joel?
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
Yours?
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
Oh, hey, Patrick.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
Then why did you ask me?
Nothing.
What do you want, Stan?
Oh.
Thanks, Stan.
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
And after that?
How did I look?
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
Do you swear you didn't know?
Hell no.
He's coming?
This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
Well, what should we do?
Where?
What?
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
Let him go, Stan. I can help.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
It's freezing out.
I better do this, Stan.
'kay.
Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.
It's just... y'know... I mean...
Stan... c'mon...
Hi.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
You made me have an abortion.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
What, Howard?
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
You are such a sweetheart.
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Welcome, Howard.
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Yes?
Howard, your one o'clock.
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
Is everything getting worse?
What do you believe in then?
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
The Clock People?
Siwash, huh?
Clockworks?
What was that?
But I don't know how to polka.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
Where are the others?
You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
I don't.
I'm staying with the Countess.
If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
No, I guess not.
How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
That's Jellybean!
I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
What is Debbie's position?
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetükame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
You're political, then?
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
About...
Tell me about it.
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right. I've done a little hitchhiking myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone. I'd heard tales about you from people I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. I heard about your, uh, your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac's girl friend...
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
I have to go, Julian.
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds.
I'm cold.
As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
I'm the best.
Yep.
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
I was a successful model once.
American Cheese. The king of road food.
Going north?
I don't know anything about it.
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
But Countess...
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
A job for me?
Your ranch?
Bonanza Jellybean?
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
A born freak can only go uphill.
Tired...
Run!
Hurry.
I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
You're okay now, it's over...
I don't know, the screens are dead...!
It is not.
His peritoneum has ruptured...
90 over 50 and falling... .
I've got a pulse, he's alive...
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
What's happening...?
Nothing. It's nothing.
Starck!
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
What does?
What, Justin, what shows you?
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
Justin.
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
Skipper...
Crystallized.
Frozen.
I found one.
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
There's no one here, Skipper.
I can see the hatch.
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
That means they didn't abandon ship.
Jesus its huge.
We've got pressure.
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
Weir.
Miller, he's back, he was in the tank...
I'll do it --
Blow it up?
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
Weir can't be alive.
Five seconds.
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
Justin's in the airlock.
Miller, come in...
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
I know that.
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
You've got to listen...
There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...
I've got a theory.
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
Miller...
Who?
Maybe one of the original crew?
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
Oxygen is not the problem.
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
It tastes bad.
We're all here.
That's an affirmative.
There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location.
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
I just finished drying...
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
I've seen bodies before. This is different.
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were...
I did.
There's no one here.
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. There was a spark and both ships were incinerated. The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...
He served on the Goliath.
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
First time in a grav couch?
I don't care.
It's cold.
You got any coffee?
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
We have to do something, oh God...
Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
Almost got it.
Do you know what it was?
Keep him talking.
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
Can you shut it down?
He's engaged the override.
Not according to the computer.
There's no one in the corridor but us.
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
I'm trying, goddammit --
Miller, do you read me, Peters --
Decompression wouldn't do that.
What happened to his eyes?
Picking up magnetic interference.
The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
If they are, they're screening their calls.
This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing...
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in the airlock?
What is it?
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
What are you doing?
Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
I'm sorry.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
Claire is your wife?
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
I can't believe we built this.
I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
What is it?
If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis.
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
A straight line.
How?
Where is Reed?
No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
What did he do to the uniform?!
He didn't.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
Victor did.
I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
But Johnny... you can't fly.
What are you doing --
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
You two need a time-out.
You gave us names? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
I'm driving.
Girl...?!
That's the temperature of the sun.
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
I think that thing is Ben.
Stop it.
Johnny.
Apparently I can disappear.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
You need a doctor.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
I gave him twenty.
Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are.
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
And reverse the mutations --
What are you doing?
No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
Are you kidding?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Excuse me?
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
If it happened to him, then it could...
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
What...?  Oh.
What?
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
What? What do you mean you --
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
Which was?
You're happy for me and Victor.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
Yes, thanks.
Great minds think alike.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
It's been changed.
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
I was talking about us. Working together.
Never better.
Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
Please don't make this personal --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
You said it was urgent.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Victor, your scar --
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Victor, are you feeling alright?
You can't leave them out there.
What are you doing?
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
I understand the business reasons.
It's just business.
No.
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it.
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
But your face did!
You are a virgin!
I don't know. I was just curious.
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
I'm just guessing.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
Is everything okay at work?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
I'll explain everything later.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
Don't strain yourself.
Your friends use the pool too.
Why can't you do it?
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Hi, Brad.
Get going.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
We've got to get an abortion?
Take that back.
I know it's yours.
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
I didn't see you this morning.
I guess I did.
What's wrong?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
Hey, Mike?
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
How about both of us at the same time?
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
So are you.  Are you shaking?
He's my friend, too.
Are you really a virgin?
Pick a suit.
Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!
Do you want to take a quick swim?
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
Sure. Come on in.
Mark is a really nice boy...
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
Oh, really?
Nice to meet you.
And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
Not if you're over sixteen.
All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
Yes.
Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
Dartmouth?!
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
But what are you going to do?
Yeah, like maybe never.
Sometime?
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Not coming? What happened?
He's not coming.
Where's Doug?
Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
I want romance.
What do you want?
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
I paid for it and everything.
That little prick.
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
That little prick.
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
You're right. I didn't tell you that.
You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
What?
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
It couldn't be.
What do you think it is?
What do you think it is?
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
No.
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
I think they're both virgins.
What do you think?
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
How long does Doug take?
Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'
No. But it's a nice idea.
Does that ever happen?
Climax together.
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
Sixteen.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
Thanks a lot.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
Not since November.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
Hey! That's my line!
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
It was nice.
You'll always remember your first time.
It was okay.
Was it great?
Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
Just kidding. About 10cc.
There's nothing to it.
Well I never did it.
What's the big deal?
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
What variables?
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
Do you think guys find that attractive?
I know.
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
No way! He just called him a dick.
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
Believe it.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
If I didn't have a fiancé in Chicago, I'd go for it.
He was hot, wasn't he?
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
Really?
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
I can't do that.
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
So what did you do?
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
Should we buy a frame for that?
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot.
What should I do?
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
Don't you like him?
Do you think that guy's cute?
How's it going.
Yes.
What about those other guys you live with?
Yes... I am really nineteen.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
That's a nice shirt.
The point sounds fine.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
Thanks. So do you.
Thanks for picking me up.
What can I get for you tonight.
I know, everyone says that.
I'd like that.
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
Hi, Mark.
What about the notes?
I made a fool of myself.
Oh. I see.
John Bonham?
What's April 16th?
Where's Mike today?
Do you really have to go?
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
Do you want to come inside?
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
Not at all.
Are you all right?
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
I've heard that, too.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
This is a nice car.
Thanks for coming to get me.
Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
What's your other question?
We keep them, in case the people come back.
We keep them.
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Killed?
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
Let's have lunch!
There's no hurry! The race is over!
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
Where is everyone?
We're going to get my little girl.
We'll meet in three hours?
You know where it is?
They'll be back.
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
Careful.
We can't risk letting them in.
Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
Just move!
We just smeared a skunk.
Where's the tunnel?
Follow me.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
What's it for?
What tunnel? Where?
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
Easy.
Hey!
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
And that's how I ended up here.
Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
But not flush against the tunnel?
What's in the back?
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
What?
Anybody else?
We're going to get help.
Anyone else?
What? Really?
How much you got to see the show?
How much you got?
You wanna see, baby?
Um-hmmm.
Doesn't your foot hurt?
Okay then.
But --
Why not then?
Will I go crazy or something?
Really?
Oh, no.
What is this?
Oh.
How are you holding up?
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
Keys.
Nine?
Max?
How many?
Open?
Four door?
Is it gassed up?
What's it for!?
What's going on between you two?
What do you mean what?
What?
You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
Good.
Will these boards hold?
He shot you the other time.
He only shot you once.
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
He's dead.
My husband...
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
Get something on that.
COME ON!
MOVE YOUR ASS!
Hurry!
If he doesn't shut up...
Shit!
Move it!
Move slow and move quiet.
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
NO, but I will lock you in.
Fine, Chief.
'Eh, Chief?
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Let's move.
Ok. Let's see what happens.
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
YOU'LL HIT US!
Let's go.
Nothing, just lookin'.
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
Get to your cars!
Go!!!
Go! Go!
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
Wait God-dammit!
Hold it!
That's fine.
Okay, well that's something.
Father. The biggest, the strongest...
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
I think --
We should stick together out there.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
Her name is Charlie.
Right.
I admire your strength.
You know you don't have to do this.
All right.
Let's lock off this room.
Stop her!
That's one piece of four problems.
'Forgive'...? For What?
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
Putting on my armor.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
Thank you --
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
My clothes?
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
Huh.
Oh well. I guess I better leave then.
Thank you.
What?
God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
I'm not!
I'm not!
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
What does Clifford say?
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
A rich actress.
Who?
You don't think I'm good enough?
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
What's up?
Oh.
Where's Clifford?
Hello, Harold.
I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
Who is she?
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
GET OUT!
You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
In my eyes, officer.
You want his name?
What night?
No?
Dick...
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
Dick, we need some time apart --
Showdown.
...Yes.
Fired?
Claire?
Who?
Sort of.
Thank you, Harry.
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
...I see.
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
...Don't you?
Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
Thank you.
Really?
But I'll never win that.
Thank you, Ralph.
No. Never.
No.
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
Daddy!
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
I know that, Dad, but --
...So what do you think?
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
Of course.
What do I do, Dad?
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain --
It's already started, Dad... with me.
He's a socialist, then?
Is Kaminski a Communist?
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
I didn't have much to do with it.
Thanks, Dad.
See you next weekend, Dad.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
Good.
That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
You're poisoning that child's mind.
When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
Bread?
I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
Oh, Kurt!
But, Kurt, I...
Kurt!
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
Fifteen.
I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
Just one minute...
Why, you... you little bastard!
What is this?
What?
They'll mend.
...Not if I can help it.
No, I don't hate it.
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
Then don't go to Hollywood.
Are you really serious? About acting?
Are you an actor?
I wouldn't miss it.
You can always come see it in London.
That would be okay.
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
No, we're not.
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner.  ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
Well... you're looking well.
How did I look?
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
Yeah. I don't know.
Oh Harry...
I love you, Harry. I love you.
...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
Who?
I got your number, Mister Man.
I know. Don't tell anyone.
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
What's that?
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
To quarter-horses.
What a man!
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
You can't drink.
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
You know something, Harry?
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
...Take advantage of me.
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
I should've known...
Where are we, mean man?
Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
Oh my God, I look awful.
Who said I was a lady?
Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze.
I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
No, Harry, I can't --
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
I took the early rounds.
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
Help yourself. Everyone else has.
What's left of my blood.
How the hell do you find me anyway?
Harry, I hate being in love. I don't ever want to be in love again. I just hate it!
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter!
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
I know.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
The hell you will, Harry York.
Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something...
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
No, they don't, do they?
You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
Forget it.
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
Well, the studio told me not to.
Yeah.
Harry... I met someone.
I know what ability you're interested in.
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
You jackass!  C'mon, let's get out of here.
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
Jesus.
Oh no...
What?
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
What?
Yeah.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
...So you think I should go.
What happened to him?
Quietly.
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
Don't be a rat, Harry.
How'd I look?
Well? What'd you think?
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
Harry.
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
Yeah. Could look bad for you and Kaminski too, I guess.
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
Whattaya mean?
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
No... Actually, you look more like a cop.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Okay then...
Don't touch me.
Shit!
You know, I've never been able to figure that out.
Yeah.
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Yes.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
Fine!
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
Who's writing this guy's lines?
What?
I live here.
What happened? Who're you?
Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it.
You think I got it?
How's it sound?
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
'But how do I know you love me?'
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
But I want to. I'm trying!
I'm not!
That's me, Clifford.
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
No! You're not talking now. You listen. You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. You can't pretend I love you because I don't. I can't. Not after what you've done to me. Because you see... I'm still me... I'm trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all.  Okay, boys, I'm ready.
But what --
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
I have!
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
I will, I promise.
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
Thank you for understanding, Mama.
You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
Oh, just leave those things for now.
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
Frances!
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
You're not going anywhere!
I'm going out!
Where are you going?
You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
Mama, shut up!
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
No!
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
Haven't you heard what I said?
They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances, you can't do this to your fans! Why, they've been praying for you all through this nightmare. You can't turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail I've been answering!
Mama...?
Don't... talk crazy.
Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
I'm back, Mama.
Yes, Mama.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Yes, Mama.
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
Say you promise.
Sure.
At one. Promise?
I'll be back.
I'll have lunch ready by one.
Not long.
How long will you be?
For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
Where are you going?
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
What's wrong?
I think I need a little air.
Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
Well, who have we here...?
Go on...
What?
You kill me, Mama.
It's your fan mail, little sister.
Then why did you bring them?
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
Why are these all opened?
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
You're taking me home!
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
Mama, what's...
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
Smile, little sister, smile.
It's okay.
...You will.
I don't care.
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.
Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
But they're using you!
And you... should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for yourself.
Yes, Ma.
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
Mama...
Oh bullshit.
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
Don't I know you?
Excuse me.
Symington says...
No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders...  ...and your pencils...  ...and your god-damn buttons...  ...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!
I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!
'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
You what?
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
Oh for Christ's...
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
What?
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
Yes. It was very good to see her.
You didn't say 'Symington says'.
Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
This whole thing is a joke!
...Did you really say that?
Normal. Average.
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
Oh! Are you really?
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
It ain't for lack of trying.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Are you all right?
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
I should go. I should leave today.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
Nothing. Still nothing.
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."
And you look so lovely.
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
There, there... shhh...
It's far too late for him to still be out.
Is he not back yet?
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.
He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
Victor!
I have been waiting for this ever since.
Brother and sister no more.
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
It is
Why the change? What about your work?
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
What sort of task?
I thought I'd never see you again!
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
Victor. I love you,
I give you my soul...
Our decision. Together.
Not as weak as I.
I will be here when you return.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
I wish to be your wife.
Brother and sister still?
Is that what makes it so delicious?
All my life I've known.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
Father's so proud.
Smell the air. Wonderful.
Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
Aren't you?
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
The killer is still out there.
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
No, no, they're all dead...
Jack? Marcie? Ned?
He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
Good night, Brenda.
I guess...
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
I was careless.
Tomorrow is another day.
What'd you see?
Sure.
Next Friday.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
You told her to sweep the courts.
Cabin B is ready.
Why don't we run? Just run now?
What's the matter with it?
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
Marcie?
Okay.
They're off now.
Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field?
It sounded like Brenda.
I don't hear it anymore.
Absolutely.
Well, it hasn't been that long.
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
How the... did he get in there?
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
I don't know.
I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
Artist.
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
Oh, my God...
Un-hunh.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
You're welcome.
Sure.
Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
I'll be along.
How come?
Everybody goes home!
I'm going for 'em!
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
I promise.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
It's a flop house.
What do you think Mom would say?
That happens, you'll get it back.
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.
Ain't it the truth.
It's the bitterest of pills.
What did I say?
Do what?
What?
What's in Mexico?
Where are you taking us?
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
What's going on?
Later.
Me too.
Should I use the last bullets on us?
Not many.
Watch my back!
Noooo!
We have to go back for Daddy!
I'm really sorry.
Are you okay?
Okay.
You're gonna let us go?
Yeah, we got a bible.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
Creepy guy.
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
-- you got your shower --
-- you got your microwave --
What'd you find, Kathy?
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
Don't say my name.
But are there... I mean, how many...
The woman I saw you with...
I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a man."
Who's "we"?
That's what I hear.
Thank you, ensign.
Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
Jordan, dear.  How are they treating you?
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
Are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee?  I mean, I'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts.
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
Sir?  What did he say?
Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?
Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
I'm saying, we're just friends.
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
Permission to leave, sir?
Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not --
See me, sir?
So I'll get a fair shot?
Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
Across the board, sir.
Same rules for everyone, sir.
The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
No, sir.
I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
Pardon?
I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
None at this time, sir.
Really, I have no problem with --
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
I'm fine, sir.
Thank you, sir.
West?
Newberry, get a photo.  South?
Fine by me, sir!
Ah, c'mon...
Sir...
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
Yes?
Think I overplayed it?
I'll act surprised.
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes.
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
"The Lark Report."
Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...
Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off.  No more test cases. He was only too happy to oblige.  Don't play politics with me, little darlin'.  You'd be up way past your bedtime.
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
You'll think about my offer?
I'm sure it is.
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team.
I wanted the choice.  The chance to prove myself, my skills, my work, me.  That's how it should've been.
The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
You don't know that.
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
Should probably ask him that.
What changed?
Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent.
Absolutely not.
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
Sounds familiar.
You know him.
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
Uh, ma'am.
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
Can't complain, ma'am.
There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter.  And your success would mean a lot.  Jumping, now...
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
Yes, dear.
Uh, question, ma'am.
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
California.
"Coronado."
High-school pentathlete... ROTC scholarship, graduated with honors... top marks in Basic Training... and, as it just so happens, a constituent of my home state of Virginia.  Oh, the things I'll do for one extra vote.
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over.
Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!
Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
Do that.
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
Sir?
Come on, Montgomery...
Just do it, okay?
I can make this wall without --
Just a coincidence?
I was looking for him earlier, but...
The Navy Cross...
What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
I'll try anyway, sir.
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
Which is guy-speak for...
So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.
Yeah.  Me too.
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado...
"In Washington..."
I don't know, I don't care.
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
What about him.
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
No shortage of suspects.
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
Sure.  I'll join the crowd.
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
So why are you telling me this?
I saw an article...
Me?  Why me?
I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
Which is guy-speak for...
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
This has nothing to do with you.
You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
I take it you don't either.  Feet.
Just like you would be.
Is this my glory, sir?
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?
Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles.  All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride.  Check the files -- DPRK-57 -- I doped it out as a contingency plan:  Seal Team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up with recovery sub.  But don't waste time opening and closing hatches.  They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters.
Unless you Whiskey Run.
North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system.  Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  Where's The Polk?
Chances of recovery?
Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha got?
Lieutenant O'Neil.
This is insane.  You've got no proof.
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
Do you, uh, know...
Thanks for lying.  But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up.  Besides...
I can't go out.  Not like this.
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
Sorry, didn't mean to --
Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me...
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
You got anybody, Wick?
He was married?
That's a good story.
They had to kill 'em?
If you got a good one, Wick...
You really came back for more?  Of this?
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
Who is it?
Thanks, Wick.
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
And how do you know that?
Whose orders were those?
Well, now I feel so much better.
Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez, help him.  Flea?  You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead.
So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?
'Cool?
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?
I don't know...
What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they --
What're you guys doing?  Huh?
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
Show us where you are, Chief.
15, sir.
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Sure.  Just like your men do.
No.
We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
I think you're the liar.
That's not right.
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
Wasn't deemed a threat.
Should I be afraid?
Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
"Dad."
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
Permission to get dressed, sir?
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
Say again, sir?
Shut your hole, Slutnik.
FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.
MOVE!
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
North?
Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
Funny, the C.O. says I can.
Anybody usin' these drawers here?
Your new roommate.
No.
But we can get to the west side faster.
The JFK? In the rain!?
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
He's not going to do it.
Think we can fit up in there?
Don't you think we have enough?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Animal, I can't.
My God. He's going after the nest.
Yeah. Why are you asking?
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
He stole my report! That's my report!
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
Nearly four years...
No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
Well, I can be tough if I want.
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
Really? I'd like to find out.
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Oh my God! They're coming!
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
Our network covers the Ranger games.
Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
You never said it was off the record.
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
Nesting?
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
Are you sure?
What else do you know about it?
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
And you think this creature is one of them?
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
Sure. I'd like that.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
Yeah, well...
What?
It's good to see you, Nick.
You must have quite some harem.
I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it.
Wish me luck!
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
That's the problem. He did.
Nick Tatopoulos.
He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What the hell is he doing in Panama.
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
My life sucks.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
You're kidding, right?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Can I use some?
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
We? I don't think so.
You don't understand, I can get us information...
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
I can't.
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
Mr. Caiman...
Mr. Caiman, you're married.
Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say?
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Did you talk with Humphries?
He always has to make the big entrance.
No I didn't.
What?
Down there.
Those blue things ate everybody here?
I don't know.
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
Alex? Where are you going?
FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
The ships are gaining...
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
All this from watching the.. historical records?
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
You could order something in.
Why didn't you stop at the market?
Alex you can't -just leave.
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
The guy is terminally selfish!
All systems are working, Commander. ,~ -cc	PINK) -' C -
All systems are working, Commander.
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
We need another one.
It's fractured...
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
The enemy is matching velocity.
Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
I never get tired of that joke.
What's the weather like outside?
I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
We're getting major structural damage.
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
Oh, they're so cute.
Where are the miners?
Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
THAT'S why you built this ship?
You... know us?
Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
never doubted you for a second.
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
Well forget it!  I'm not going.  This episode was badly written!
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
Wait... Jason, Here!...
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
Turn on the translation circuit.
Nothing. Hold please.
Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
Thank God. Are you okay?
Jason.. Can you hear me?
Clenched jaw...
How does the rolling help, actually?
Why does this sound so familiar?
You're playing your good side.
I could have held on to YOU! ...
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Computer, can it be repaired?
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
I don't think that's a cloud...
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
JASON...
Jason..
There's nobody here. Jason...
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
Only answers to me.
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
What?
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
Tommy, look!  Those lights...
What are you doing? What are thev doino? ~7C INT. SARRIS' SHIP	h37C
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
Wait, Fred, what about your thing, you know... "Digitize me, Sergeant Chen!"
We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
You gotta admit, they do love him.
Unbelievable.
You're kidding. When for?
This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
I don't want to see your hospital.
Not today.
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
Some things must never change.
Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now.
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.
That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
You're no fool, George.  You never have been.
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
Have you been reading what Minister Jefferson has to say?  If he had his way, all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome. And that would destroy us as surely as a British victory.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
My God, what?
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
"Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..."
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
George, you know I only love you, but...
Is that the truth?  Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer.
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
Voltaire, of course...
Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong."
And dost thou live to ask it?
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
Those people?  I doubt they'd think of this.  Ooo, you're wonderful this color!
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
Let's get you darker!
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
Do you?  When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped.
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
It's stupid, of course.
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
In the minuet, George, every movement is significant, like the strut of cranes...
The word 'minuet' finds its source in minitus, which is Latin meaning 'small' or 'orderly'.
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
Where... do those men come from, George?
What took you so long?
Go get your stuff.
You don't act like it?
Were you scared up there?
Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
You're as bad as Harry...
Are you going down?
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
Harry... My God...
Hey, Chili? Look at me.
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
Really.
Yeah?
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number.
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.
And you think the movie business is any different?
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
I want to know.
What do you get out of it?
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
Then you've read it?
I think it's not horrible.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
I just caught the end.
Right. See how your story ends.
Don't go out of your way.
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
Yeah, you know when Bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty look and says, 'I'd kiss you, but...'
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
You saw that one?
...That's what we finally decided.
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons -
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
What're you doing here?
How much is the wife offered?
A real bargain.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
I know what a vig is.
What if it was?
You broke in?
Harry -
Chili and me.
Harry, we spoke with Martin.
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
How did you get in the house?
Harry -
Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
I don't have a dog.
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
Be quiet and listen.
And after all, you have such morals.
Thanks.
But you are interested?
Lufkin. His... agent.
Oh, for Christ's sake -
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
Really.
Hello, Martin.
Get up.
Dodge.  Dodge.
Why not?
Did you?
Try Wednesday.
Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside.
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
Oh yeah.
Seen a lota movies.
Maybe he isn't alone.
So we kill him?
Maybe that is his boat.
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
I like my job.
Guess I'll just keep working.
What other choices have we got?
This's gonna hurt a little.
Or uninvited guests.
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
Bring it on, dude.
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
No.
Roger?
Maureen.
Maureen.
What?
One more?
Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
Better than starving to death.
Sudden flashes of light.
Headache, nausea, lights?
Any dizziness?
Because of the gold.
You're a pal.
Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
That's a good thing?
That's what I call a payday.
Probably didn't have time.
You mean, before she sank.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
Could be a fishing boat.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Morning everybody.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
So you killed them?
You killed them.
Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank.
What?
What happened?
If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
They went crazy.
Maybe it was more than that.
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
What do we do with him?
Right here.
Nope.
Epps, over.
Just lucky I guess.
I don't know.
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.
More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
What happened.
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
No. Someone else. A girl.  I'm not sure she was... real.
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
The what?
What do you think happened on this boat?
Couldn't sleep.
Hey.
It's not gonna hold us.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
The same day she supposedly went down.
"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
But, who -- ?
What?
Only something must've gone wrong.
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
Same. Any luck?
He needs a doctor.
Greer?
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
Epps.
Yup.
No cowboy shit. Right.
Guess that'd be me. Again.
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
There's somebody else on this boat.
The guy. He just came this way.
Did you see him?
Why not call for help?
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
You're more practical than superstitious.
You think she's sailing without a crew?
So what did happen?
Nope.
Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.
She was sailing up north, right?
What'd you find up there?
Coffee?
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
Go on.
It's my pen name.
JUST DO IT!
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
Are you going to yell at me?
What?
It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
Nothing.
Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.
I guess.
What is it now?
I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
God, how horrifying.
Not the Maxine?
YES.
Who?
How should I know?
Who?
Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying.
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Will you get off my back for once?
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you.  I had to give it to someone else...  But I'm sure next year I can --
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
Help me what?
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
I didn't check my messages...
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
Huh?
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
What do you mean?
Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.
I...
Well, yes...
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
So what do you think?
...wow...
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
Hmm.
Well, I know this is really short notice, but I got a call from a very close friend at the Academy of Art & Design and she tells me that I'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program... and, well, I hope you don't mind, Enid, but I took the liberty of submitting your name.
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
Uh-oh.
Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
Did you actually do this painting?
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
I see... interesting...
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
Who is this, Enid?
Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
And what can you tell us about this...
Jesus...
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
Okay, okay... I won't say a word...
But I was only trying to be friendly...
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
You can count on me, sir!
Hey Josh.
Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
Why do you have that stupid poster?
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
That's just the way I am!
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
Then why do you hate me so much?
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Why?
I guess.
Can I come in?
I just stopped in to say hi.
Hi Josh.
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
Oh my God, that's HIM!
I figured something like that...
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell.
SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
That guy rules!
So Josh...
I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
It just came yesterday...
Wow... finally.
Maybe an orange juice.
Do you want anything?
Actually, he's a really nice guy.
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Hi.
Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
I dunno...
What time?
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
That's all you're bringing?
There.
So where's all your stuff?
It's fine.
So, whaddya think?
I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off.
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
I need to talk to you.
Hello?
FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
I said "great"...
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
Great...
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
When was this?
Nothing.
Why? What did he say?
He came into work.
What? When did you see Josh?!
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow.
I don't believe you.
Just some people from work...
What are you talking about? Who?
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
So should I come over?
How repulsive!
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
What happened to Seymour?
Do you still want to do something tonight?
Hello?
God, I'm so sick of Seymour.
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
What thing?
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
You're insane.
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
Don't you want nice stuff?
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
Look, we have to get these...
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
God, you're really obsessed...
No, really...
Go ahead...
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
Yeah, I guess... call me...
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
Do you want to do something tonight?
Yeah, thanks.
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
Don't worry.
Now are you going to get a regular job?
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase...
Fuck it. Everything must go!
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
We were such desperate sluts back then.
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
Get away from me!
...maybe we should be lesbos...
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
You're just jealous.
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
He gives me a total boner!
Which one?
You're gross.  See that guy?
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
Like what?
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
But those are our people...
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
That rules!
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
God, how can you stand all these assholes?
He does that every single day.
That guy is totally amazing.
You cunt!
Just now... I went with Seymour.
No way... when?
Anthony's II!
Where?
You won't believe it! Guess!
Where did you get that?
Give me all your money, bitch!
Wait...
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
I totally, totally hate you.
If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go?
I don't believe you.
It's a surprise.
What? Where?!
I know a party we could go to...
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
How about this?
God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
Ew ... when did you get that?
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
How about this one?
Everybody's too stupid!
I didn't get it either.
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
What was that all about?
It'll only take a second.
Why are we going here? I hate this place.
Should we leave a note?
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
I'll bet he never jerks off...
JOSH!
JOSH!
Why don't you ask him.
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
As always.
There he is...
"Hassle"?
Let's go hassle Josh.
Where are we going?
I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back.
It's always closed...
We still have to go in there sometime.
Fuck you, bitch!
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
What? How long have you been standing there?
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
Just promise you'll do it.
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
What are you talking about?
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
What, is she black now?
"Funky"?
Somewhere downtown.
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
Forget it, I can't explain it...
Not really...
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
Oh yeah...
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."
That was truly pathetic.
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
Gross!
Ew, look at this...
Come on, it's too late now...
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
Bingo!
The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again.
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
This is way too creepy.
This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
We should follow him home.
He's insane!
Totally! Look!
Are you sure?
I dunno...
Do you think he knows?
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
What's he doing now?
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
What's going on now? What's he doing?
I can't believe it!
It's obviously him!
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
She says she wants to MMPH!
SHUT UP!
I'm going to tell him you said that.
I want to "make love" to him.
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
Look, maybe that's him!
Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
Shh, it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP.
What does it stand for?
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
You're better at it.
Why do I always have to do it?
You call.
Oh yeah.
You know, the green cardigan guy.
Which loser?
Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
Fuck you!
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
What are you talking about -- who?
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
I want to do him!
No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine.  There! Look at her!
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
There's my dad with Joanie.
I remember every minute of that party.
Look, that's back when I hated you.
What a little hosebag.
Look at how cute I am!
I've been looking all over for this.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
Hey - why do you have this?
I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
What is this?
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
So what should we do?
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
Does Oomie really like this show?
Oh, we totally have to.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?"
Gross.
Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
You can have that one.
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
What does that even mean?
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
You loser!
I might actually get the pasta special.
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
Hi, Al!
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
God, it's so totally pathetic.
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
Hey, look at this...
Okay, okay!
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
Or maybe not.
Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
That lets us off the hook.
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
In fact, never.
Much later.
We should follow them!
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
Did you sign up yet?
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Just look at them!
Why?
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
Hi.
God, think about that... that's actually totally depressing.
Good.
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
He better watch out or he'll get AIDS when he date-rapes her.
How perfect.
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
I know, she needs to die immediately.
Since when is she an "actress"?
Forget it...
What? Why?
Uh oh... don't turn around...
Shut up!
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
This is so bad, it's almost good.
You loser.
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
Why?
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
What?
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
God, what a bunch of retards...
See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid.
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
Just because.
We're not.
What about me? Am I not even here?
Well, we won't keep you.
What are you doing here, Melorra?
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
Nothing.
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
Shhh!
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
Where did you get those pants?
It's kind of falling apart.
I thought it wasn't for sale.
Who does?
Do you have any other old records besides these?
That's okay...
How much is this?
A what?
Go die, asshole!
That tape sucked, by the way!
That's not even --
I know it's over, asshole, I --
Tell me what?
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
...are you waiting for a bus?
Hi... what's your name?
Later, "Dude".
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
I did too!
Did you bring that tape?
You're late, asshole.
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Five hundred.
That's five hundred dollars.
I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
Shhh... I really need to get some sleep.
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
Yeah, well... me neither...
No... forget it...
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
God, Dana's going to kill you!
What's the matter with you, Seymour? Don't you like me? Be a man for once in your life!
What do you want?
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
Jesus, how can you stand her?
Where did you get this?
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
What about this?
Do you have anything to drink?
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
Can you at least let me in?
I had to see you.
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
In whatever way you think I mean.
So, do you like me, Seymour?
Does that mean you don't like me?
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
And you like them?
Well when can we do something?
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
Sounds good...
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
Boo!
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
What? You're kidding me...
So, what happened?
Hi, it's me...
Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Wow!  What was that all about?
Aren't you going to get that?
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
Never...
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
What, like a girdle?
What is that?
Are you okay?
No, Doofus... blow it out!
You can open your eyes now.
Don't you trust me, Seymour?
I promise I'll take good care of it.
Hey, can I borrow this?
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
Yeah, but still...
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
What are you, a fry cook or something?
You work at Cook's Chicken?
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
What, are you a klansman or something?
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...
Wow, this is so cool...
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
It's not hopeless...
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
Just wait here.
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
Jesus, Seymour.
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
So, why did you bring this along?
Relax, Seymour, relax...
C'mon, Seymour, please?
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
OH MY GOD!
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
PLEASE? We have to!
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
Let's just say "music" - that way you only use up one...  Wait, we have to go in here for a second...
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
Every guy has a type!
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
What about her? Would you go out with her?
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
I'm totally serious!
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
Really? Can I see it?
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
Hey, I was only kidding!
Oops! I dropped it!
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Wow!
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
Okay.
How much is it?
Wow!
Is this one any good?
Sure, I guess.
Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
Do you have any old Indian records?
Call me sometime.
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
I wish I could see him.
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
Please Josh?
I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret!
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
What do we have here, Margaret?
Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier.
Talk to us about it...
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
On that pathetic fake blind date.
Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
That slut!
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
Why? What did she tell you?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
I don't know... where is she, then?
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
She's not at home?
I'd rather not.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
We don't have a relationship.
I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my baby.
Everybody has a choice.
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
What do you want with my baby?
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
Good night, Janosz.
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Janosz?
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
Thank you.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
Does he ever mention me?
How is he these days?
Do you ever see him?
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
What are you working on, Egon?
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
That's exactly what you said last week.
No, you didn't, Frank.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually.
You're also a human being, Frank.
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
That's a terrible thing to say.
That's not true.  It was 1620.
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
Maybe I should call Janine.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.
Does she know anything about babies?
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
I don't know what to do anymore.
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
Good-bye, Peter.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
Oh, hello, Peter.
Good luck.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
That's where the buggy stopped.
We definitely had a moment or two.
I'll do it.
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
His name is Oscar.
What do you think?
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
Hello, Peter.
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
Hi, Egon.
Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck.
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
I don't think we should leave her alone.
Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
Well, good night, Louis.
That's very practical.  I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too.
Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
What are you doing up here?
Who are you going to call?
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
All right, what happened to me?
Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
I am Zuul.
Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
Hi, Louis.
I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Are you sick, Louis?
Hi, Louis.
Talk to my accountant.
Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
Really!  Is it gone?
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
I want you inside me.
Take me now.
Do you want this body?
He is the Destructor.
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
I've got to go now.
All right.  Since you put it that way.
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
You must have gotten the last copy.
Can't you tell me now?
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
You heard it?
Goodbye.
All right.
Then leave.
I'll scream.
Out!
That's it.  Get out.
All right.  What do you want to do?
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
Are you all right?
I told you, I ...
I'll wait here if you don't mind.
Uh-huh.
What?
Like a used car salesman.
You really don't act like a scientist.
That's a violin concerto.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
Is that your professional opinion?
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
Do you want posters, too?
Not yet, dear brother...
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
"... by the emperor of Rome.  This writer asks:  between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?"
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
What are you talking about?
The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
You're coming back?
You can't do that!  You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
If I may be so bold...
Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
Those are priceless sculptures.
No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
I'm sure, I don't know.
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
Maybe you should get married.  Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.
Don't you think you should at least wave?
And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon.
That's what you told me two days ago!
Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
You cannot die.
"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men?  How like my father you are.  You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive.
But you do exist.  Narcissus:  hero of the battle of the Danube.
I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it?  The Emperor himself, didn't you know?  Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front?  Burning patriotism? Filial love?  He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor.  Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
You teach them!
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
I don't want you to die!
Narcissus!
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
No!
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
Let him trust Quintus.
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
You need to come home!
They're studying with Cynics.
Athenians...
Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
Benjamin?
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
No.
Shhhh.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
No, Benjamin.
Well -- I said I might marry him.
Yes.
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
I just don't think it would...
I just don't think it would work.
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Tomorrow?
Yes.
I'll think about it.
I have to go back now.
I don't see how we can.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
I don't know.
Yes.
I might.
I don't know.
Will you kiss me!
Benjamin?
Goodbye.
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
Well -- where are you going?
Are you going home?
What are you going to do now?
Oh.
The marble?
Don't you have it on?
What are you looking for?
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
Don't tell me --
Please let me go.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
I don't feel well.
Why?
Let me go.
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
I don't understand --
Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
How could you do that, Benjamin?
Well, I want you to leave.
I said I think it is.
I think it is.
Is it because I'm here?
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
I want to ask you a question.
What?
-- really incredible --
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
But you're not enrolled.
Yes.
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
I thought he said by the monkey house.
No.
I've never been to it.
At the Zoo.
I'm meeting someone.
Get out of here.
GET OUT!
Oh my God --
You mean the one who --
What?
What is it?
Because I want to know what's happening.
Benjamin -- what's happening?
What's the matter?
Benjamin -- I really do.
I do.
Yes.
Okay.
All right.
I'm glad.
And it's all over now.
Did they ever find out?
With a family?
Was she married or something?
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
Yes.
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Benjamin --
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
What is the matter?
Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?
Where we going?
All right.
Is anything wrong?
We won't. Let's go inside.
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
Yes, I do.
No.
No, I couldn't.
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
What?
I want to go home.
Where is the car?
I think I'd better go home now please.
Will you take me home now?
No.
I don't know.
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
Why not?
Aren't you eating?
I'd love some.
Do you always drive like this?
Are you going to graduate school?
Do you know what you're going to do?
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Hello.
I'll be there in an hour.
Give me an hour.
Did you get a room?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Benjamin?
Hello.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Will you bring it in to me?
For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
Could you bring it up?
I'm in the bathroom.
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
BENJAMIN?
I don't think so.
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin.  Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road. We have a burgler here. Just a second. I'll ask him.  Are you armed?  No -- I don't believe he is. Thank you.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
Go home now.
Then you'd better start believing me.
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
Do exactly what I say.
Drive down the block.
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Thank you.  Benjamin --
Promise me, Benjamin.
Then give me your word you won't.
Thank you.
May I stay then?
You don't have to say that.
But if it's sickening for you --
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
If that's how you feel --
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
Of course I wouldn't.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
Did I say that?
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
What?
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
Are you?
I see.
You're not.
I wouldn't know.
Yes.
Benjamin?
Let's drop it.
No.
I have my reasons.
Good.
Good.
Do you understand that?
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
There's nothing to tell.
Because I don't want you to.
No.
Don't talk about Elaine.
That's enough.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
Oh my God.
What?
I don't think we were the first.
We'd go to his car.
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
How do you think.
Kind of.
Art.
Why are you asking me all this?
Yes.
Yes.
Not particularly.
What?
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Are you shocked?
Don't tell Elaine.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
See if you can guess.
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
No.
Is it?
I don't.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
Not exactly.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Is it?
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
No.
About five years.
No we don't.
We don't.
Thank you.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
Calm down, Benjamin.
What?
The driveway's on my side of the house.
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
He's asleep.
I walk out.
There isn't any.
Him?
What?
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
I don't remember.
What?
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
Do you want to hear it or not?
I got up.
Do you really want me to?
Can I take off my clothes now?
I don't.
No.
Neither.
Go ahead then.
Don't you?
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
How about art.
Well?
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Well what do you want to talk about?
Are you tired of it?
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
If you want.
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
That you're afraid --
On your first time --
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
You can admit that, can't you?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
Are you afraid of me?
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
You what?
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
Thank you.
Either one will be fine.
What?
A hanger.
Will you bring me a hanger?
Why don't you watch?
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Benjamin.
Thank you.
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
The number.
Yes.
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
Benjamin.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Well -- do you want to go up first?
That's fine.
Why don't you get it.
Yes.
Do you want to get it now?
Do you want me to get it?
Do you want to?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Did you get us a room?
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
Waiter!
May I have a drink?
How are you?
May I sit down?
Hello, Benjamin.
Thank you for taking me home.
Benjamin?
Yes, I do.
Because I find you very attractive and any time --
Do you understand what I said?
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
I want to say something first.
Don't be nervous.
On that chair in the hall.
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Would you like me to seduce you?
Why is it?
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Don't you think he trusts us together?
What if he did?
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
Then why do you keep running away?
What are you so scared of?
Thank you.
Come on.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
Won't you unzip my dress?
I think I'll go to bed.
Will you unzip my dress?
Benjamin?
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Yes.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
All right. Now finish your drink.
Sit down.
It's all right.
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
So?
Well I don't know.
Like what?
What?
What's wrong?
Pardon?
My husband will be back quite late.
No.
Sit down, Benjamin.
Did you know that?
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
What do you think of me?
I'm very neurotic.
Yes.
Drink?
I don't know.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
What do you drink?
What do you drink? Bourbon?
Please.
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
Will you come in, please?
Thank you.
No.
My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?
Will you take me home?
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
In general.
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Is it a girl?
Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.
Is there an ashtray in here?
How are you, Benjamin?
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
When did you two talk this over?
Well -- when did you decide all this?
They don't know?
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
-- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
Goodnight.
No.
Goodnight, Benjamin.
But I don't want you to make up something.
Not if you don't want to.
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
What else?
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Yes, I can.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Yes?
Yes?
Hello.
I don't believe it.
What's happening?
They came all the way from Tarzana.
The Carlsons' are here.
Is anything wrong?
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
Yes -- oh!
For tonight.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
Yes --
Anything for you.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Why?
Yes -- I'd love to.
I'll do anything for you.
That was lovely.
You were very different yesterday.
Chasing what?
I'd given you up.
All right. We'll dance.
Of course.
You're very funny --
Where downstairs?
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Free --
Aren't you?
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
Very little.
Money -- Ever heard of it?
No -- why? -- should I?
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Dictation.  You know...
Oh -- work!!
That.
Have you seen it?
Who?
You're a fool!
Not with strangers.
Till then.
On the train?
I'm worried about you.
They've brought me such good luck -- you --
Why do you think --
No?
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Why later?
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
Very early in the morning.
Suzette will be back here any minute.
Shall I see you again?
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
Yes.
Yes -- yes -- yes.
And now?
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
So --
I'll not denounce you.
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
Oh --
What is the matter?
That's a silly joke.
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
And what do you do -- now?
And?
No?
Really?
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.
I want to be alone.
What?
No.
What can you see?
Why do you smile?
I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
Just for a minute then.
I want to be alone --
I want to be alone.
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
Go away. Who are you --?
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
Strange man...
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
Yes -- tired...
And -- and --
And then --?
Why do you look at me like that?
Certainly.
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
Because you love me -- you love me?
Why do you hide in my room?
What do you want here?
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
Am I!
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
Oh yes, of course.
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
Later?
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
What?
You don't understand that do you?
Money!
I didn't like Preysing right off.
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
Yes --
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
Please -- please!
Really?
You dance splendidly.
You're trembling.
You must look at my face and not at the floor.
Dance then?
Oh -- you would!
A man might what?
You like music?
No - absinthe.
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --  Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:  'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'.
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
Oh, no.
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
Here, hold up!
You think so?
I had to arrange about the trip.
Well, he's a gentleman!
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Oh, yes.
A thousand marks --
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
I understand perfectly.
Well?
Well?
Well -- you want me?
Nothing.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance.
Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern.
Tomorrow morning.
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
Hello!
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel?
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
How nice -- your daughters?
...weight into the balance...
Cotton Company --
I understand you perfectly.
You're a little too fast.
Not too quickly.
No.
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
Perhaps.
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
That's from skiing.
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
Moreover...
Me.
I got ten marks for that.
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
Moreover...
You pay me.
No -- only occasional jobs.
Moreover...
Moreover --
I'm the stenographer.
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov?
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
Goodnight, Suzette.
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Madam should sleep.
Yes, madam Suzette knows all about it.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Madam has slept well?
Good morning, Madam.
Good morning, Suzette.
All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
Oh, come, Madam -- please come.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --
The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Let us cancel the engagement.
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
I can't dance tonight --
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep.
I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
I wish to be alone.
Hurry, Suzette.
Take them back, Suzette.
Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
Oh -- but it can't be.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
I'm cancelling the engagement.
But when did he go? How do you know?
Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
Good morning, Pimenov.
That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and...  ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished.
Last night?... There was no applause.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
The performance -- the performance -- the performance.
I will. So long, Bobo.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
He's a good kid. A salesman.
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
Permanent damage.
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
You mean, the insurance frammis?
No.
You're calling the shots.
It'll never happen again. I swear.
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
My son was in the hospital --
My son --
Bobo, no, I --
I want to keep my teeth.
I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
Hi, Bobo.
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
Fine.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Do you have something around back, facing away from the road?
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
I like you, too.
Roy? He's always crying.
Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
Henry, no!
We're not really interested, Henry.
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
So here we are!
Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has--  -- you don't mind my telling him, darling --  -- suffered reverses. If he could...
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
Goody!
Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
You know who I work for.
Well, make it stop!
What? He's going to be all right!
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
I know.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
It's not your fault.
All right.
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
But they must be! They cut glass!
What is?
But what's wrong?
Why? What's wrong?
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
A future. The only future I've got.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him.
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
You're getting off the grift?
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
I know what's bugging you, of course.
You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.
I'll get it.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
You want a drink?
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
What?
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
At what?
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
Just a few bucks.
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
As though you do what I say.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
I've really got to --
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know.
You, too, Roy.
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
No. That was the point.
You do?
Roy, I don't want money from you.
What's that?
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
You don't have the stomach for it.
Get off the grift, Roy.
You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?
He let me live. He let me be his friend.
I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. I hoped that would cover me.  It didn't.
That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.
The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
No. And you have to be.
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
You always did.
Don't mention it.
Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
Only one tooth?
Only one arm?
So what's your story today?
We'll work something out, Joe.
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
Joe, you know you'll --
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
You heard the shower, didn't you?
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other.
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
What is it? What's going on?
Bullshit!
For Christ's sake, why not?
What?
No! Because I --
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
What?
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
I saw her.
I went out to Delmar.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
Open it and find out.
Open your door.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
Think about it. Okay?
Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just...
Atascadero.
Upstate.
He retired.
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
The long end. Big con.
Roy, you're a short-con operator. And a good one, I think. Don't talk to me like I'm another square.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
The tap. What you do for a living.
Oh, come on, Roy.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
You already went back to work.
I'll sign that affidavit.
No.
Big spender.
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
I don't see why we have to take the train.
I'll see you when you get home.
Get well soon.
You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
I want to know everything about you.
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
No, baby. Come to Mama.
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
No more than this?
Roy? It this all we have?
Look at me.
Roy?
Are you sure?
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Detective...
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Do I know you?
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Do you know who did this?
My god...
A dead body?
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
That would work.
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Please, get on the bus...
John...
John, you can't help her now.
Just get on the bus.
Get on the bus.
Where are you going?
I was trying to protect you from this...
No.
Yes.
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
I was trying to get away from someone.
Will, sit down...
Oh, so now it's my fault?
It's an option.
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
I know.
I thought you'd never ask.
Where are you going?
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
My point exactly.  See, we both agree.
Forget it.
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
No.
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
Betcha' didn't predict that.
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
Who?!
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
We've got to get these kids out of here...
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
Yeah.
Are you going to leave, too?
Shit happens.
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.
He's my brother.
Michael Meyers.
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
What?
Bye Will.
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
It's not going to happen.
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
It's always John.
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
Looks great.  It does.
Do it, Norbert.
Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.
You've killed women?
Out!
Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool.
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
How do I load?
There it is.  Give it to me.
Where's the bullet?
I mean it!
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
This is suicide.  Go get the police.
I'm going to call the police.
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
No.
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
Honor, I suppose.
No you don't.
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
You're begging him to kill you?
He's a child!
Like what?
Sounds quite beautiful.
Blue soup?
It seems highly intelligent to me.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
Rifle?
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
I see.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
Just one favor.
Almost a Christmas scene.
You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Two hundred years old.
He cried.
He knows you shattered his violin.
Unless she has nerve.
Did you like it, dear?
A dozen?
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
I came for Paul as well.
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
I came for my clothes.
Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
No you're not!
What are you going to do?
I don't think so.
Yes.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
Yes.
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
No.
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
They don't have to feel like slaves.
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
People don't use that word any more.
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
You're wrong.
What a honeymoon.
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
Breakfast?
I have some change!
I have a brain.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
Turn around?
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
It's so--so stark.
He hasn't had breakfast yet.
A trip, you mean?
I did?
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
Do say hello to your mother.
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
Please--
Harold!
I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.
Thank God!
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
Shouldn't you lie down?
He's a very decent man, Harold.
We thought it was an emergency.
We thought a doctor might help.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Situation.
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
Give us time.
Not at all.
How do you do?
Some kind of animal?
What do you do for a living?
This is crazy.
You don't even know me.
I'm engaged.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
Sir?
Eighteen--  and a half.
Can I help you, sir?
Heaven.
How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
What will you do, Colonel?
And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.
How horrible.
What happened?
Who's dead?
For what?
Alice is dead?
Dead!
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
You didn't even find that out?
Alice got married again.
And you went home unannounced, too?
Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
You don't know?
Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
Then get him.
It is an emergency, isn't it?
What does he say to do?
What are his symptoms?
That's why I'm crying.
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
That man is your father.
For Heaven's sakes!
What's his name?
Then who flushed the toilet?
Is Norbert still here?
Yes, he is.
Who have you been talking to?
Where will you be?
I hate that thing.
I don't really know.
A lot of people don't.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
Not true.
That's an interesting piece of news.
A what kind of doctor?
Thank you, kind sir.
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
He's a ghost!
Oh, Paul--
I know.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
You and Harold are friends?
It's true.
You were wonderful.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
I'm sorry.
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
Possibly.
What's the matter now?
What was it?
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
Did you talk to Paul?
How nice.
A what?
You figure!
The park!
Is he coming home?
Is he all right?
Did you see him?
What then?
Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one.  Shall we go?
Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.
Coming.
Good night.
I see.
I'm touched.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
Yes?
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
I know.
I'm glad.
That's something I suppose.
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
Doing what?
I'll get ready, Herb.  I didn't expect you this soon.  Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?
Please--
Do it!
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
You fool, you fool.
Get out of here.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
I believe in miracles now.
How neat.  How keen.
You know each other?
He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.
It's a jungle out there.
He's not your son.
We've got to rescue him.
Paul's only twelve years old.
And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
I'm amazed.
Why would you do that?
Meaning?
It's suicide!
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
That's the XKE.
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
As long as he keeps out of the park.
It is?
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
What?
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
She quit this afternoon.
We made the date three months ago.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
Wait?
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
That's cool.
Now, what do you want?
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
Are you going to stiff me?
Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
Pull out your cock.
I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My name's Felice.
You're still dressed?
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Do you want to take a session?
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
But then you'll forget about me.
I can't tell you that.
What happened?
Did you find out where she was?
So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
She left you right?
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
You wife isn't dead is she?
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
On your own land?
Do you live in a house back in wherever.
I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
Just a second. It's my ass I'm risking. You better do it my way. These fuckers don't mess around.
Rot in hell, honey.  He's busy now.
Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
I thought I was fucked up.
You really believe all that?
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
No, please go on.
Fuck.
Shit.
Yeah, yeah, go on.
What the crap?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?
He deals in pain.
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
Tijuana.
What do you care about?
We're just alike. You think sex is so unimportant you don't do it. I think sex is so unimportant I don't care who I do it with.
How important do you think sex is?
Neither am I.
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
No.
Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
No. But does it make any difference?  How did you get to be the way you are?
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
You don't understand shit.
'Sucking off.'
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
What rate?
At least I'm a growing person.
Hey, don't worry about it. Your daughter's around. We'll find her in a couple days.
And your wife? Where's she?
Jesus.
Of Joanne's?
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
You're not a private detective either, are you?
You don't drink?
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
Huh?
I thought you were going to bed?
This is different. This is nine hundred dollars.
When do we start?
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
Up front?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
Are you a private detective?
You're not a film producer, are you?
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
Tod might know.
Nah.
No. I saw her with Tod.
Joanne?
Got any parts? I'm free. Not free- free, but, you know, free. I don't really do this.
You making a feature?
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
It's your money. You talk.
Too bad. I wasn't in it.
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
She thinks so.  What do you do?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
Jake'll take care of me.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
You can fuck off, too.
Well, he can just fuck himself.
Who's that?
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Thanks.
Was he with a girl?
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
Because if you are...
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Check.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Officer, I can explain.
No.
We planted it.
But there is a family resemblance.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
Haven't we met before?
Hello.
All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
No, no. I just took it.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
Oh, I don't have one.
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Oh! That's wonderful, Harold. Go - and love some more.
"And this too shall pass away."
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
I feel giddy.
I thought eighty was a good round number.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Oh, Harold.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Oh, Harold. You are so young.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
I took them out.
Yes.
- end where I began.
Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world.  What a joke it will be if like them I -
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
I don't know. Perhaps.
Yes. They're old friends.
Well, they're my species.
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
Don't you advance on me.
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Well, don't go.
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
What is it, Harold?
Well, be kind. I've lived a long time, Harold, seen evil as well as good, and it has been my experience that kindness...
Oh.
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
From the guys who got the matches, of course.
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
Well, why don't you?
With Life.
Pray? No.  I communicate.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
It's so blue.
I like you, Harold.  Come, I'll teach you to waltz.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
Of course.
How ingenious! Tell me about them.
What was that?
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
It's all right.  It's organic.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
Yes.
Yes. It's almost there.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
I suppose I did.  Well, farewell little tree. Grow up tall, and change, and fall to replenish the earth. Isn't it wonderful, Harold? All around us. Living things.
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
Superb.
Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone should be able to make some music. Why, it's life! - Rhythm and harmony - That's the cosmic dance. Come with me.
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
Oh come on. I'll teach you.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
No.
Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
Oh, it's all right. It's organic.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
Yes.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
We'll come back in the morning.
He's fallen asleep, as usual.
Oh, my. We're too late.
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Exactly.
Why not?
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
Over there by the courthouse.
Look.
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
Oooh, but they are not. Look.
Why do you say that?
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
Wonderful! Try something new each day. After all, we're given life to find it out. It doesn't last forever.
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
No, you have to touch it.  You have to run your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel. You try it.
What do you think?
It goes on and on.
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
It was my last. I then became infatuated with these -- my "Odorifics."
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
She seemed yare to me.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
How about some ginger pie?
Harold?
Promise?
My door is always open.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
Oh, at the dentist's?
Well then.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
Oh, look! The birds.
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
Oh.
Your hearse?
Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
No.  I thought not.
Do you sing and dance?
Do you dance?
Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again.
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you?
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
He... he loved me.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
Yes!
Kyle, you don't have...
Because I'm going to get my father!
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
Get out of the way.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
What do you mean?
What?
The box. I need the box.
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
And you're sure it was a woman?
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
No bad dreams.
Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised.
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
I... I had a visitor.
God, that's terrible.
What's the matter with her?
You a doctor, too?
Well... G'bye.
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
Finish what?
What are you talking...
You were ALL human!
It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
Wait!
And what about you?
I've come for my father!
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
The Cenobites.
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
He talked about Demons, huh?
I thought Steve had talked to you?
What are you talking about? Who are you?
Steve...
Where am I?
Sure.
Where's my father?
What's happening?
Not much.
Hi.
You can keep them.
Stay the fuck away from me.
No. That wasn't the deal.
I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
HE did. I've seen him.
To a man called Frank Cotton?
You did this before, right?
Let me alone, will you?
No!
This isn't for real.
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
Who are you?
It's just a puzzle box.
Oh Christ.
I don't remember.
Please listen to me --
It's important.
I have to speak to my father.
Frank --
Bastard.
You bastard --
Oh my God.
This isn't happening.
You want it?
No.
This isn't happening.
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
No.
No.
Julia!
Well we can't just stay here --
Maybe we should just leave --
Don't you care?
That's probably her now. Or the police.
She'll tell them everything...
I said no.
I don't.
Yes. They'll never find us.
And the blood let you out?
So you were cheated.
You're still afraid.
Who did?
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
Hell...
What kind of doors?
Let me see.
A box?
You promised me an explanation.
Tell me, damn you.
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
Later.
Well?
You're hurting.
Keep your voice down.
Who?
Good.
Hurting.
What do you want me to do.
Ssh!
Back from where?
What happened to you?
No. God no.
Tell me who you are.
Who are you?
Oh my God.
I'm very happy.
What about Larry --
But you said --
Well?
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
Oh.  Oh yes.
Oh.
That's right. Who are you?
Oh my God.
No, damn you --
I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see?
I saw everything.
This afternoon.
I was here this afternoon.
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
Of course. There's no need to shout.
I have to see my father.
What's the problem?
Where's Daddy?
Kirsty? It's very late.
The keys are in the kitchen.
Sure.
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
What happened?
Just to your left.
Which is where?
There's a towel in the bathroom.
Hi. I got soaked.
Kirsty.
Dead.
It's better you see for yourself --
I don't know where to begin...
Please. I can't bear it...
Please...
Don't go upstairs.
Larry...
-- I'll go see.
Fine.
I've seen worse.
Who was it?
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
I'll be down in a minute
Maybe a brandy.
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Just feeling a bit sick.
I'm here.
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
Larry....
No you won't.
You're done worse.
Take it slowly.
No, you're not.
It's probably going to need stitches.
Let me see.
You're NOT going to faint.
Is it deep?
What have you done?
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
Why not?
He's here?
In here.
Larry!
No argument.
All right.
No. I'm not.
You mean we're moving in?
I thought half of it was your brother's?
Not exactly modern.
Why didn't he want to sell it?
How long since you were here?
It smells damp.
Just a thought --
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
We're going to freeze to death.
What's wrong?
Am I?
Maybe I will.
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
That's right.
I prefer the floor.
We don't need a bed, do we?
No.
That's right.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
Do you care ?
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
I... suppose so, yes.
You want something to drink?
There's a first time for everything.
That depends.
Please.
Just soda.
Not much.
What?
Steve.
You wouldn't believe me.
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
Who brought me in here?
Wait a moment --
What happened to me?
I have to get out.
It isn't. I know what's going on here, and it isn't over --
PLEASE. You're in danger.
Get the fuck out of here.
Yes!
I want to see.
I don't believe it.
Gone?
Finished?
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
I have to talk to you.
Sure.
What?
Really?
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
Maybe you should give it some time.
I love you too.
Yeah.
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
I've forgotten.
Sure.
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
Surprise.
Is Julia here?
Me like.
Big house.
I will. See you.
Take care, Dad.
Of course. Every day.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
Great.
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
YOU'D like my room.
No Dad.
I said: I found a room.
I found a room.
I got through.
Daddy?
'Bye.
Sure. Why not?
Will you GO, damn you?
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
Don't let them take me, Steve --
These THINGS... they want to take me --
Steve. Thank God you came.
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
No, it's good to see you.
If I make it through the day.
I've been better.
Oh!
It's not what I heard.
Oh no?
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
She's so damn... English.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
What do we do if there isn't?
All right.  No. That's nice.
Not that late.
You know I do know the way home.
I'm coming!  Sleep well.
I'm here.
I AM house-trained.
Just upstairs.
I won't be able to stand.
That's right. Cointreau.
What are you talking about?
Where's Rob?
Hey, Barry.
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
What's his name?
Nice friend.
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Fine.  That's great.
Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Is there a difference?
Your desert island top-five.
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
So.  Is now a good time?
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
Well, you've asked.
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
About what?
So?
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
Very persuasive.
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
No.  Probably not.
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
I know.
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
What are you going to talk to me about?
Right.
Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
We took care of that.
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
Barry said its done.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
Just local, of course.
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
I called Dan Koretzky because he --
I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
Wanna go to dinner?
Hi.  What are you doing?
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
How?  What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice?
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
More confident, maybe.
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
But what?
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
How?  How were we the same people?
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
To make you feel better.
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
What's the difference?
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
Want to know what, exactly?
Let's go home.  Okay?
I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
It'll have to be sex, then.
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
C'mon.
I don't want to go back.
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
You're also an idiot.
You're soaking.
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
Look, are you coming or not?
I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
In a minute.  When I get it together.
I'm sorry.
My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
Pig died.
Pigsty.
I can't talk right now.
Hello.
Well, think about it.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
Those aren't mine.
Oh ho, so very infrequently.
Mmm hmm.
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
Ray.  I hate Ian.
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
You know what I mean.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
I'm sure.
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
You don't ever think about other people?
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
I'm not -- hold on...
I figured it was.  Where are you?
Hello.
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
Will you call me?
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
Is that why you wanted to see me?
I told you I slept with him.
So, how are you?
We'll talk some other time.
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
Will you please just go?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
I haven't felt like it.
Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
You really think it would make a difference either way?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
Is what better?  Better than what?
Just ask it!
Nevermind.
Fine.  One.
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
Oh, Rob, shut up.
I suppose so.
I don't know.
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
Rob.  Don't be childish.
Did you say something?
What?
I guess it's not that obvious, then.
What's the obvious stuff?
What were the others?
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
I think you know that.
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
And do you like it that way?
You really believe that?
Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
I remember the song.  I just couldn't remember who sang it.
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
I thought I could give you a lift back.
Hi.
I should be so lucky.
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
Enough of what?
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
What difference does it make?
It's a crematorium.
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
How're you holding up?
You called this morning?
Hey.  It's Liz.
Right.
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
That way.  You?
God, you ask a lot of questions.
Good.
So you'll stay?
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
Are you okay?
You haven't even seen it!
The Conformist.
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
Yup.
Thank you.
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
Everything go alright?
Don't you like that?
Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
Sure.  Ten cents.
Fine.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
Seventy-five.
Sixty.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
What do you think?
Go to hell.
Sure.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
Yeah.
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
Some guy named Smith was asking about him in Church Hill.  I passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank.  So he isn't a cop.  District anyway.
I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
It's in good condition.
Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
Claymore.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
Fine.
Doesn't have a head, does he?
Thanks.
It's my birthday.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
Would you remember his name?
Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
The boy _died_?
I don't follow you.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
Why?
No thank you, I'm fine.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
Yes.
You have lived forever.
The inheritance.
No!
What is it?
What's wrong?
Will I see you again?
What is it you want?
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
What is it like?  Being you?
Damn you.
Don't.
Is that a threat?
You kill with your left hand?
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
What about that family in '31?
You killed those other two.
Of bodies.
That's insane.
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
He knows about you.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
I'd like you to try.
Who are you?
Just a little crazy.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
I'm not even sure why.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
I hope I never get that old.
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
That's impossible.
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
You're using your son's name.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
It's beautiful.
There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.
It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
Well, as long as we're stuck here.
No.  So what now?  We just wait?
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
Yes.
You want me to front for you.
You make it all sound so simple.
When you finish, what then?
You did kill those men.
What's all that?
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
Is this what you killed them with?
Maybe.
You're wrong.
No.  I had to talk to you.
No.
Are you?
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
I'd rather hear yours.
No.
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
What about me?
He was innocent.
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
He called you "MacLeod".
What will you do now?
And you?
Who is he?
Dupont Circle.
He tried to kill me last night.
What the hell is going on?
Why not?
Jesus Christ.
I have friends.
I've been to Church Hill.
I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
Does Carl Smith?
Who?
Grave robbers?
Someone beat you.
Good reflexes.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
Byzantine?
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
Very traditional.
Do you play?
Thanks.
Now there's a new topic.
I'm just curious.
Never take up poker, Detective.
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
What's all of this got to do with me?
What makes you so sure he's the one?
You're an asshole, Moran.
It'll never stick.
What are you getting at, Moran?
Spare me the details.
Four?
We've got nothing to say.
I'm calling an attorney.
What do you want from me?
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
Who is it?
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
Yeah.
Corey, you _owe_ me.
I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
All I need is for you to check the name.
Give it a rest Ned, huh?
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
He's too cool.  Too sharp.  I think he's got something to do with it.
I don't believe him.
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
Who is it?
I'm getting married tomorrow.
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
Fine.
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
Oh, yes. Here it is.
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
Out some place.
Oh, she was here.
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!
We'll explain the whole thing to them.
Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
Hello, Bruce...
Well, the story's practically finished. I'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
The Criminal Courts Building.
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
I'm sure you haven't any.
Yes, wasn't it?
The check, Bruce!
What's the matter?
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
He certainly -- hic -- does!
No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
I'll come a-running, pardner.
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
You -- you!!
Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
Walter, you can't do that!
You're not fooling anybody.
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
What!
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
What's the matter with my brains?
What would you do if it was a daughter?
Walter!
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
Thanks.
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Don't remind me. That's how we happened to --
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
In a way.
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
Who did you talk to?
Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
No!
No, you don't! Walter!
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Yes.
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
Ring that number, will you?
Lafayette two-one-hundred.
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
Is this the Community Hospital?
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
Louie!
What happened?
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
I'm finished.
Double-crossing swine!
Is he coming back here?
What tickets?
Where's Bruce?
Where's Butch?
All right, Walter.
Okay, Walter.
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
Where's some paper?
How much do you want on it?
Huh!
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
I get it!
I'd like to think.
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
I know, but --
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
She jumped out of the window.
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
We're not interested.
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
You said it.
What now?
Thank you.
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
Allow me.
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
Now you got me.
Better.
Afraid? I should say not!
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Thanks...
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
He's in the insurance business.
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
Bermuda.
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
You can't sell me that, Walter.
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
Look at this!
I'm not working for any other paper!
Please! Will you just --
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
Get away, Svengali.
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Keep away --
No!
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
Dead?
What's the matter?
You -- you --
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
Listen, Walter --
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
I know, Walter, but I --
You bet I've got a better offer.
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
Just what I said. That's what I --
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
No, I can't.
I have a lunch date. I just want --
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
What?!!
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
What home?
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
Done what?
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
How long is what?
Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
A lot of money.  Four hundred and fifty dollars --
There's money in it, Cooley.
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
Give me a hand with her, will you?
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
All right -- all right!
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
Three bullets! Any good?
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
Gus, this --
Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.
No -- just coffee, Gus.
I guess so.
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
How's everything, Gus?
That's murder!
He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.
He's harmless.
With a bag of marshmallows.
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
What do I know about Williams?
Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't stop me!
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
Take your paws off me!
Let go o' me. What's the idea?
That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later.
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
You'll take fifty and like it!
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me!
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
What did you do with her?
Oh-h-h... was she hurt?
Where's the old lady?
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
Editorials?
There goes another scrub lady.
Give me that!
Who is it?
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
Any news?
I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
This is Hildy Johnson...  Oh, I can give it up all right. Without a single quiver. I'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats.  Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I didn't mean "dear." That was just habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, Walter. I've got some news for you... Yes, I got the interview, but I've got some news that's more important.
It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
Look out, you --
What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end.
If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back.
No -- what?
I thought so, too.
I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
And up a dime.
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
You know it is!
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
Here!
Where's the money?
Come on with that money!
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
Have you got my dough?
Mother!
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee.
Kings and sixes.
Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
Mother!
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
Mother!
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
How'd you get here, Earl?
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
Sure I do, Earl.
Don't talk too loud.
Well, maybe you think I could!
Earl, you must never do that again.
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
Put down that gun, Earl.
I won't, Earl.
Isn't that her picture?
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Very simple, Earl.
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
What are your beliefs, Earl?
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
Are you all right, now?
Shut up, you!
Never mind! Just play dead.
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
Ssh!
Quiet, Mollie!
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
Wait a minute, Mollie.
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you.
Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
That's not the point.
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
I'm starting my own collection.
They've got the real thing outside.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
You're the biggest fibber.
He's the worst liar.
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
Where?
What is it?
Air-raid?
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
They might be.
A bit too quick.
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
When do you think you'll get leave again?
What are you going to be then?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
You taste it.
It looks....foreign.
How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we're mad on jam.  They could poison half the country.
We don't know anything about it
And what's that?
I wish you could have told me yourself.  Oh, Grace, it's not for long. They say it'll be over by Christmas.
You joined up.
Has Sue got it right?
And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
They'd gone.
No Turks.
Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
Now take deep breaths, and push.
Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
It looks a bit fishy to me.
It's not. It's happening to me.
I don't believe this is happening to me.
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
What did he say?
Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride.
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
What is it, pet?
Who said anything about love?
You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
There, there, my baby.
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
No, I won't.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
Out.
And where do you think you're going?
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there.
The ideas you get in your head.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
Don't be silly, Dawn.
What would we do if a German came into the house?
Half the time he's bluffing.
He always knows.
After this dance.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
You know it? It must be an old one.
Just ignore her, Mac.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
Wasn't it lovely?
Up to six weeks, I think.
No, Mother! It's War! War!
I wish it could all have been different.
Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
He could always make me laugh.
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
It seems to have survived.
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
I can't do it. What's the point?
It was the best time of his life.
And now we're glad you did.
How long?
What did I do to deserve this?
Father, that's enough now
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
You're having me on, Molly.
Molly!
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.
I know you mean well.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
My aunt in Australia has offered..
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.
I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes make me nervous.
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
Cone.
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
Who's your Daddy!
Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year.
Drink up, it's party time.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
Ma, Tiny's in.
Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel.
Tiny's home.
Whoopie fucking doo.
OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house.
A dead one.
You're welcome.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
Yeah, come on.
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
Come on.
OK.
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
Oh yeah, the tree.
Couple more miles up this road.
Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.
Yeah, I'll do something.
Why? You gonna do something about it?
You shouldn't a done that.
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
Fucking great.
He walks, duh.
Oh, wonderful.  Fucking psycho.
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
What the hell are you laughing about?
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
Do you believe this fucking girl?
You know... a couple of queers.
What?
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
Wondering what?
I was just wondering.
Can I help you with something?
Nice.
I'd like to see that.
The animals have got nothing to do with it.
No! He's one of God's creatures, he can't help it if he's dumb... I'm just crazy about animals.
What's this?
Come on, bro. Let's go.
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
Great story Goober, how much?
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
Now, what makes you think that?
Lock the fucking doors.
I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless.
Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
Yeah, showtime for what?
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
Turn that fucking radio off!
Honk at him. Scare him.
Here he comes.
Drive through it!
What are you doing!
Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?
How much is a person supposed to stand?
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
Check this out.
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
What!
What?
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
Then run him over, he'll move.
Go around him.
Why are we stopping?
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
She looks like a freak.
Should we stop?
Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
Oh.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
How's he get around out here?
How long is that gonna take?
Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.
No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
Help, help us.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
This isn't funny, it's twisted.
What are you laughing at?
Shhhhhh.
Really, now is not the time to make waves.
Thank you.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
When you were outside with Bill.
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
So what?
Yeah?
Why?
So.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
Oh, yeah.
Fuck, it's freezing.
That seems likely.
Ugh, what's that smell?
Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
I don't want to see that.
Tickets for what?
Huh?
Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
A couple hours!
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
Jesus Christ.
Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
I still don't.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
I don't hear anything.
Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.
What? I didn't hear anything.
What was that?
I don't know... about half an hour.
How long has it been?
Yeah, she said we looked queer.
She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
I can't believe...
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
You got to be fucking joking.
Don't even say it.
She looks like she stinks.
Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.
Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
Maybe he's a cyborg.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
Geez, he never gets tired does he.
Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
Tell me about it.
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
I resign.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
No please, let me sit this one out.
Rise and shine.
Sleeping.
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
Enough with the stupid voices.
What!
You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
You said it, not me.
Just back up.
Huh?
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
Sorry.
No, just a little too old.
What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
Where is he?
Where's Bill?
Why? Why are you doing this?
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
It's embarrassing, okay?
Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
French?
Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union.  I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
Say my name.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Hello, my little boy.
Okay.
Please let me go with you.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
We still have you and I.
Oui.
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
That's Lila?
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Don't be silly!  And you were wonderful, too! I loved the way you said " au revoir."
You were wonderful!
You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig?
Hunh.
That's not how he tells it.
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
I've moved on.
Anyway. Come already to the point.
Please. I look a mess.
Well?
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
What for?
Like what?
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what!
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
Yeah? What?
Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love!
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
Stop. Get away.
Not in front of the boy.
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
Hmmmph.
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
What is wrong, my darling?
Shh.
You are sweet.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
I am sleepy.
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Shall we close up, then?
Oui.
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
Is everything fine?
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
Oui. Perfect!
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Oui.
Oui, doctor, oui.
Okay. If you think it will help.
That's what I'm counting on.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
He's dead.
You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.
Good. I'll show you how, apey.
You what?
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
Very well.
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
It's okay, Puff.
I'll be in touch.
I'm really glad you two found each other.
Shut up, you.
Oh, Rosie.
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
Ready!
Oh, Rosie.
Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?
Your brother should have his license revoked.
How'd you know where I was?
Rose, please go away.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
And I think I'm going to.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
Three foot one.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
One night stand?
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
Really?
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
Won't he be able to tell?
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
What do you mean?
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
Shut up and tell me.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
Always. Ow.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
Ouch. Yeah?
Ooka.
Oook. Oook.
Ugnh.
Eat shit, thumbtack dick!  Thank you, Frank. You're the best.
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
So he's doing okay?
You were gone a long time.
Ummm. It's good.
Should I come with?
Absolutely!
You just have to control it. We're not apes.
Oh boy!
That was wonderful!
I had sold my fucking soul.
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
How's work?
I'll make it.  I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right?  Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink.  Voila!
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
Really?
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
Do you like my new look?
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
It would just be helpful to know.
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk.
So, how's it going today?
I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
You are an animal.
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
Who from work?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Nothing. Be right out.
All right.
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
What?
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
He looks perfectly fine.
I think he's feral.
Come on.
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
I don't know. Something.
Did you see that?
That's very funny.
Absolutely.
Yes.
Yes, darling.
Fifteen.
Of course.
Yes, darling.
I don't think so.  Why?
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
Do you?
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
I'll be out in a minute.
Nathan!
Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
I like you, too, Nathan.
You really enjoy my company?
You do?
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
Boy, this is good!
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
I'm sorry?
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
It looks wonderful.
We are animals after all.
I'm not sure.
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
What's the larger experiment?
Paper or cloth?
How's it going?
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
You are a therapist, right?
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
Where?
You've got to respect that.
They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
Sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. You're a Roman, Bert. You have to win them all.
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
Thank you.
How?
You bastard.
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
For whom and for what?
You know what's good for him?
Do we need words?
We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
And a fact is a fact.
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
I'm ready.
I've never been to Louisville.
No, I'm fine.
Packard. Sarah Packard.
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
I'm a little tired.
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
Why?
He went off someplace.
Fifty-seven.
No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
Why should I?
Leave now.
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
No, I want to walk.
Sure. Let's go home.
A week? A year?
For how long?
What do you want to tell me?
What is it, Eddie?
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
I feel pretty.
Sherry.  Very old, very dry.
Yes, I'm glad.
Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
I love you.
You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.
Does it bother you? What he said?
Is that what makes a winner?
Is he a winner?
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
Why did he tell you?
Would he know?
A loser?
No. You?
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
What happened?
Who is it?
That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too?  What happens, Eddie?
Give it back to me.
Give it to me.
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
You going out?
Do you want me to go?
From a rich old man who used to be my lover.
No, why should I? It's yours.
Eddie, what's in that case?
Oh, it's not bad.
Oh, cut my finger.
Eggs. How do you like them?
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
I'm getting treatments right here.
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
Mm hmm.
You want to go with me?
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
At school. It's Thursday.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
Sarah.  Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone.
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
How did you know my name was Sarah?
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
Why?
What time is it?
A day like any other. People come, people go.
Why did you do that?
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
No.
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
I drink.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I'm not.
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
I used to be an actress.
Sometimes I wake up and I can't sleep, not without a drink. The bars don't open until eight. Mack over there has faith in me. When I'm broke, he trusts me. Don't you trust me, Mack?
Do you always ask so many questions?
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
It's the lights. And the scotch.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Fair.
Thanks. I will.
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Eight o'clock.
What bus?
Fine, thanks.
Since four.
What?
Yes.
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
I want to talk.  I just learned again.
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
Do you still want me to stay?
You want me to stay?
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
I don't know.
Humans.
Yes.
I don't know.
Mine.
I know it.  What do you want, Robert?
Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
You know what I mean.
What do you want?
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
Why don't you start with me?
You want to kill them.
You want to find them.
What?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
Who is this?
Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
We move.  Place to place.
With them?
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
Yes.
It is not arguing to speak the truth.
That is not now, human!
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
Why, yes.  Why?
He was upset with moving, I believe.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
Of course.
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
Mr. Gardner, I --
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
We were having a little talk.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
You're looking for life?
Let's try.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
Don't go in.
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
Damn.
No one comes here after dark.
All their lines were busy.
The State Police.
Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
But it's not, Jimmy.
I don't see anything.
If we go and look and there's nothing there, you'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind.
Where, Jimmy?
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
This shows how to get to my home. I'm giving you back roads and footpaths, so there's less chance of you being seen.
Do you know how to follow a map?
Why?
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
A UFO lands in back of your house and puts something in your Dad and Mom's necks.  Then it gets the police, and your teacher too.
That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?
Can you tell me about that?
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?
All right.  I'll be right back.
Why, yes.
What's his family background?
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
You bet it did.
Are you all right?
With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
He's a good man.
I take it you've heard.
David, don't...
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
What do you want me to do?
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
David? How'd you get this number?
What?
You're being paranoid.
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
What do you want?
Love was never our problem.
Spunky. He told you about that?
He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
We're losing them.
You saved a lot of lives.
I'll bet.
I don't know how you put up with him.
More than likely.
Dick-weed.
You scared the hell out of me.
Sorry for what?
I know, you like to make a big entrance.
You're late.
You're late.
Dick-weed!
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
Really? You don't mind?
Be careful.
Wait. I have to tell you something.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
You can't go. Call them back.
He's trying to impress you.
Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.
No. Exotic.
I'm a dancer.
He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
He's my angel.
I can reach it. I can reach it...
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
I never expected to see you again.
All I have to do is scream.
You do.
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
You came back for the book? Why?
How did you get here?
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
How do you know?
What are you going to do?
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
No?
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
You had it? You didn't trust me!
The Grail Diary.
What were they looking for?
My room!
You said go between them!
What?
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
What's that?
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
Are you sure?
The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
Lower me down.
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
Find something?
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
In that case, I permit you.
I usually don't.
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
I knew it was you --
Doctor Jones?
It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
Finally!
What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show you!
I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman...
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to get ready!
Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
You should have been there...
Hard to believe, isn't it...?
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
And they don't even know what it really is.
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
Anymore ideas...?
What above the curves?!
I can't!
What're we going to do?!
You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you...
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
So now they believe me.
Indy? Did you talk to them?
I want to go home...
What?
They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ...
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
Wait -- what're you doing?
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
What is it...?
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
I am -- it looks horrible!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
A what?!
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
What?!
Please -- oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off!
Oh no -- oh no!!
Get -- the -- bug -- off!
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
Dr. Jones?
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
Primitive sexual practices?
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?
Not leftovers?
I've never been so hungry in my life...
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub.
Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...
You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?
He's afraid of something.
Just try and control yourself.
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
What does the writing say?
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
Oh really?
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
He'll be okay. He's a good kid.
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
It's starting to let go!
Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
THE WHAT?!
PET IT??!!
Just one arm!
What?!
It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!
It's pulling me deeper!
What?!
Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!
A SNAKE!!
A snake!
Indy! Help me!
Somehow I feel safer in here.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
What'd he say now?
Their children?
Took what?
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
What do you mean -- how?
What'd he say?
Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
Siam? But I'm not dressed for Siam...
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
You don't look very good.
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
Who cares? Where's that diamond!
Hey, he's not a waiter...
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
I'm going to puke in it...
Give me your hat...
Figures...
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
You got it!
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
Let us get to the border!
Nice?
I didn't do anything.
I'm...scared.
Can you fly this?
I insist.
Dieter?
Oh, I can't.
What is your name?
I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.
What part what?
It'll remind me of you.
Aren't we all.
What a nerve!
ya hyutn slulptsa?
In him?
What happened?
He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
He's not an ordinary man.
It's just money.
Yes. Joe.
I have a new client.
We met on the beach.
I know a nice island.
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
He wants to apologise.
What is it?
I told you, I work for him.
That's twenty feet high.
If he was able, what would he say.
But you did it. It was you.
It was you.
You are, I've seen you.
Do something!
Now what?
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
Kiss her you fool.
You're gonna laugh.
Aren't you a little optimistic?
Just like that?
Why not, what are you going to do?
I love you too.
I've never met anyone like you.
How?
I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
For you.
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
It was my choice.
Can't you do something?
What?
You can say that again. What do we do?
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
They'll listen to what we say in here.
That I really don't know.
They asked about you.
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
What'd...you forget?
What happened?
Can you?
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
This going to work?
I know the territory.
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
Chiang Cho?
What?
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
I asked him.
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
Hong Kong.
Where what?
Too late, they won't come back out till morning.
That must be him. Water taxi.
How?
Now what?
What?
Then where's the chip.
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
Where we going?
It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
Ryuji and Gruner.
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
Oh sure.
Hiroshima.
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
How do you know you can trust me?
One chip?
What'd he steal?
He must be a good friend.
What's he done?
Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
This business is over.
I'm leaving too.
You're leaving.
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
You did.
No.
No, he didn't do that.
Last night?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
There's not much to tell.
They kidded me a little.
What do you mean?
You seemed interesting.
Wanted to get to know you.
They left. I had to go with them.
Joe! What happened to you?
That depends...
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Trans Ocean Travel.
Who do you work for?
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
You're doing...Okay.
You're talking to me.
You did.
Why do you do it?
You talk to yourself.
That you're not crazy.
Are you alright?
Can I help?
As if your mind's not all there.
...and sort of...disinterest.
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
...I...don't know.
I waited for you.
You again.
I just work for the travel firm.
You mean from it.
...Rene.
Like there's someone else here.
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
Without what?
Do what?
Haven't seen you around.
And you.
Oh...I can't. Business.
Where?
Blake said that?
Yes?
Blake?
I am confused. Or maybe it's you.
Is someone else here?
What do you do about what?
Yes, baby?
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
That remote control thing?
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
How about you?
Do you want more rice?
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
Yes... Jeffrey.
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
That's for food.
Use the bathroom.
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry.
...taping?  What are you taping?
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
No, thank you.
What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house?
Why? Who said?
I don't understand.
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
Right now?
What do you need at the store?
Uh, what are those boxes?
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
Yes, it's on the stove...
Don't you have to be at the office?
You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
No, you do not.
Get some perspective, Lowell.
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
Jeffrey Wigand...
Oh, baby...
What are you and Mike going to do?
What?!
What's wrong?
I have to take a shower.
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye.
I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow.
Hello? Yeah...
No classes this morning?
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
Howard!
-- we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
Triple!
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
I'll be right back.
Yeah. I guess. You know --
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
I said yes.
It's about time.
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
No.
Ruth Rabino.
Sweet.
Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
Murder?
Forgery? Fraud?
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
It's not something I wanted either.
Hello Miles.
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
That's true.
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
Now. But first, he worked for you.
It's okay Joe.
It's a no go, Joe.
You do? You do love me?
I fell in love Miles.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
Hello?
That's marriage.
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
STUFF.  Got a light?
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
I want to nail you ass.
Comfy!
On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
May I come in?
Miles? You're scaring me.
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
You don't like me?
I have a surprise for you.
Hi.
Miles.
Fabric and fringe.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
Honey, I could sit...
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
Oh Miles!
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
I know.
Yes. Again.
Do you want to sleep on it?
Do you want me to sleep on it?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Yes.
Did you just propose to me?
Huh?
What is it Miles?
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
Friends?
Thank you for the coffee. It's very robust.
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
We're damaged goods.
Oh right. You met Patricia.
And here I thought my mother was...
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
She held that against you?
She didn't love you?
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
You look like you were a very sensitive child. You have expressive eyes.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
Is that you?
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
From a -- girlfriend.
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
Okay Miles.
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
Screw you, asswipe!
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
Miles?
You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
Have you tried the duck?
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
Howard is a beautiful person.
So I hear. Is that all?
We told you. We realized we've always been in love.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
He's passionate.
Getting married.
Absolutely.
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
He'll regret this.
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
Well, don't look at mine!
What is it you're after, Miles?
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
You just haven't met the right person.
You don't believe in it.
Have you ever been married, Miles?
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
I know you do.
I told you. I was hungry.
How do you know?
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
Did you see the tape?
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
I assume this is on Rex?
These are yours.
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
And you must be Mr. Massey.
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
Do you need a Tagamet?
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Hello, Rex.
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
We are. And it's winding down.
Rex. Get away from the door.
So. Now what?
He never even asked. He just assumed --
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
Forgery and Fraud?
Please!
Jesus.
I was devastated. Of course.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
I guess.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
Well, that's about to change big time.
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
So what?
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
But you're going through with it?
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
What?
Right.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
Is this Ming?
I want to be exposed.
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
Hello Miles.
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
You're not...
Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.
Shit.
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
So where are you now?
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
I'm dying.
Every week --
Oh, God!
Lilly's up.
He has a reputation for being tough.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
Well what does he want?
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
I wish I had your discipline.
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
We do have a man for you.
Maybe.
Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
Who's she?
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
Do you know him?
Of Massey Myerson?
Miles Massey.
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
Wow.
She did a Harriman.
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
Muriel Rumsey.
Who's Rex's guy?
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her.
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
How is she?
OhMary
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
Do you love her?
That's an evasion.
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
You were taken for a buggy ride?
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to
You're a peculiar chap.
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for
The reward.
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
Yes, I knowbut
And this is what you wantthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
Come in. Sit down.
Mr. Warne?
You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
Certainly!  Pay him off. He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job. Kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets.
I suppose so.
Are you going to see him?
I'm sorry you read it.
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
Oh, please, Dad
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Oh, nono.
Why? Do you know him?
Peter Warne!
Yes. Peter Warne.
Is that his name?
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to youmade your life so miserableand mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why
No, I'll go through with it.
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him.
I'd like to have a talk with him.
I don't know.
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
He's marvelous!
Fine man to fall in love with.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
Well!
He doesn't think so much of you either.
Ridiculous!
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
Oh, come now
It'll do no good.  He despises me.
Well, if it's as serious as all thatwe'll move heaven and earth to
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
Who is he?
No.
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
On the road.
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scareIwhen I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
Oh, no.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'mI'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questionsI  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
Nothing.
What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
Oh, yes. I heard.
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Stunt?
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming.
I knocked several times.
Oh, hello, Dad.
Ellie
Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey, too. Just the way I like it.
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
Please don't shout.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember.  I'm sick of it!
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
Why not?  Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business menparticularly if you're a shining example.
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
Never mindI'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
You talk as if he were a gigoloor something.
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
You only met him once .
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
What've you got against King Westley?
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do itif I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmmmmm. This filet mignon is divine!
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
I'll get it annulled.
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
South America!
South America.
Where are you taking me?
I hope you're not comparing yourself to Napoleon. He was a strategist. Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes?
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
Because marrying that fool King Westley is
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because
You ought to know why. Because
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
I might.
Why don't you put me in chains?
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
What's this about not eating?
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to  as long as I can get her back.
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statementthat you've had a talk with methat we've reached an understandingthat if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roadsall transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
It's my daughter! Go after her.
Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself.
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
Been sending her meals in regularly?
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
I haven't the slightest idea.
We've done that already.
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
Fine. I'll see you at the reception.
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for meand maybe we'll be friends  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
Sock her!
No?  Say, listenI've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listenif you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh?  All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me.  Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her, I'll go crazy.
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
"What's holding up the annulment, you slow poke? The Walls of Jericho are toppling."  Send him a telegram right away. Just say: "Let 'em topple."
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
Don't want to talk todon't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
Amateurs!
What do they say?
Any others?
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
Congratulations.
I hope you got your money.
I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh, Peter
I love you.
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
Why not?
Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
That's swell!
What about money?
Any luck?
Darling!
What'd you give him for the car?
What happened?
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
Never!  I'm going in and ask him
Why not? I'm hungry.
We don't need forty cars.
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
You might give me a little credit.
Mind your own business.
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a carand I won't use my thumb.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
Here comes a car!
Amazing.
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Clever.
Oh, no!
There's no end to your accomplishments.
You're an expert, I suppose.
What if nobody stops for us?
I hate the horrid stuff.
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
Raw?
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
Hayin my teeth.
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?
Well, you've given me a very good example of the hiking
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Really?
What are you thinking about?
Doesn't sound very exciting.
Try me.
What?
was so scaredthat it scared
wasbut
I don't want it now.
knowbut
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
Oh, Peter
What!
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
Peter
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
You're prejudiced.
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
That's silly.
My uncleMother's brotherhad four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
Yes.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride
Of course it is.
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
No.
I'm following you.
To New York?
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
You didn't give that boy all your money?
Why, haven't you?
What do you meanstarvation?
Not as long as I'm alive.
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
Yes.
I better go over and see her.
I refuse to resign!
You always want to run everything.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?
Next week "East Lynne."
You weren't so bad yourself.
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
Well, you were!
He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times!
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
What are you talking about?
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
Thanks, professor.
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged.
KingKing Westley was in it.
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. II did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Must be the Spring.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
Nope. No complaints.
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.
I'll find it myself.
Where is the shower?
Where'd you say the showersand thingswere?
Like this. I have no robe.
I can't go out like this.
Outside!
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed?
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  Youyou had it pressed.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
You've got a name, haven't you?
Who are you?
Do you mind putting out the light?
Smart aleck!
You're not really serious about this, are you?
That, I suppose, makes everythinguhquite all right.
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but you've been very kind.
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
Your ego is colossal.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Are you talking to me!
Now, just a minuteyou can't
That's none of your business.
You have your nerve!  Here, boy!
Of course I do. What do you mean
No. It'd be useless. Father'd get the wire before they would.
Here, boy!
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it.
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
I didn't ask for your advice.
You must have me confused with
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
What are you talking about?
Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket.
My ticket?
Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?
No, thank you.  Thank you so much.
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
I don't want it reported!
No. I'd rather you didn't.
Why, noI  Yes . . . I guess I will.
No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it.
What am I going to do now?
What happened?
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
Tell that man not to drive so fast.
Driver!
I beg your pardon!
Won't I ever see you again?
No harm in your coming to see us.
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
You sound like a hobo.
Do you know?
Well, I am.
No, it isn't. I'm hungry andand scared.
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
I'm out! I'm out!
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
Goodnight, Mr. Warne.
A headline? You're not a newspaper man, are you?
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited
I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of itthe groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging.
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busI told them to wait!
Where's the bus to New York?
Thank you.
When does the bus leave?
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
But can't you wait until morning
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the
Why, he'll be back.
Isn't he here?
Husband?
Get out!
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance.
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
No!... Shaw!  Director of The Trade Mart?  This is incredible.
Who?
You want facts, Bill?  Okay.  From 1945 to '59 only two U.S. soldiers defect to Russia.  From '59 to '60, seven defect, six return, one of them another Marine a month before Oswald.  All of them young men made to seem poor, disenchanted.
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
I'm sorry.
Aren't you being a little hard?
This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
But he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the Russians.  He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's Russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
Huh?
I don't think so, Jim...
And if you're wrong?
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
A man just called.  He asked her everything!
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
My sympathies.
Hi.
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
Honey, you all right?
One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold.  What are you doing in here?
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge.
It never did.
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
Does it matter?  Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza.  You know how I know?  That picture of yours.  The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison, and I assume if you've come this far, what I have to say interests you.  But I'm not going to name names, or tell you who or what I represent. Except to say - you're close, you're closer than you think...
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
Jim Garrison?
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
Thanks.
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
This looks pretty good on me.
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
But you're not going to stop her?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
Fine.
Can you do it or not?
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
Take your time.
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
That's my diet shit.
Beauty products.
My pocketbook.
Help yourself.
I'm not a loser.
Arrest me.
I'm not saying another word.
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
Suspicion of what?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
Are you scared of me?
I thought you were tired of your business?
Sure I can't twist your arm?
Wanna go?
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
Spain.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
Do you blame yourself for helping me?
We're partners.
I never lied to you.
I didn't use you, Max.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
I told him I might.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note.
I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.
Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
He's already there.
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
Uh-huh.
Get Ordell to come to your office.
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
Ray wants him.
He's liable to shoot you.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
How'd you find out?
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
In the bag underneath.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
All he needed was a reasonable explanation.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
What if I've figured a way?
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
I'm not sure you answered my question.
And is that it?
Did you do it that night?
You do that?
What do you do when he comes home?
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
The day you got me out of jail?
When did you decide?
Why?
You're avoiding the question.
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
What about you Max?
He tries to act cool.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
He's setting me up to make a proposition.
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
Right around here, in the food court.
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
They seem to like the idea.
I go back to work tomorrow.
How old's Annette?
Why?
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
Who was your girl before Annette?
And Annette's it for you?
Does it happen to all men?
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
How was it?
What'd ya see?
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
Surprise.
Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
Yeah.
My ass ain't the same.
It's different with men.
How'd you feel about it?
Really?
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
How do you feel about getting old?
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
We talked.
He came by.
He told me last night.
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
'74, I think.
The Delfonics.
Uh-huh.
I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
Want to hear some music?
Yeah.
What, I couldn't hear you?
Thanks, but I have my own now.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
I am. Have a seat.
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
With ten thousand? Nine.
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
It was the other guy who busted me.
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
I didn't?
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
Ordell pick up his bond?
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
Sure.
Shit.
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
You're not tired of it?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
You gain weight?
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
That doesn't sound dark.
Is it dark?
I'd love one, but not there.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
I don't think so.
Can we stop for cigarettes?
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
Can I see your I.D.?
Are you really a bail bondsman?
Okay.
If I don't cooperate?
What if I plead guilty?
Who's side are you on?
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
Then you don't see him for a few days?
Not every day?
Do you live together?
Do you think I took some of that money?
What about me?
So what happens now?
I thought you were watching him.
If it'll make you happy.
I have no idea.
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
Not in the fitting room.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
Because I didn't have it. Ray, I swear, Melanie came in and grabbed it.  And someone killed her for it.
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
I thought I did.
Si.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
That would be one point of view.
Yes. All those things are true.
Uh-huh.
Ever been tempted?
I never have. It's not my money.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
We could, if I'm not in jail.
You said that the last time.
Right. Everything's the same, except one change...
Uh-huh.
She didn't say.
Uh-huh.
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
I'm sure that was the idea.
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
Not yet.
I imagine shit needs to be done.
What for?
Not really.
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
A Broadway shopping bag.
I thought you were going to let this one through.
What are you doing?
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
No.
He sells guns.
You never asked me if I did or not.
If I'm working, I can help you.
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
Can I smoke?
Look, that shit ain't mine.
You planted that shit on me.
What the fuck is that shit?
Yeah?
Now be careful with that bag. You don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store.
Thanks.
I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?
You betcha.
Do you got something for me?
It looks good on you.
Yeah, do you like it?
Are you getting that black suit?
Hi, Melanie.
Jackie?
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
What's that fucker ever done for us?
Keep it between us girls?
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
Dreaming.
You think I'm kidding?
So tell me. Having all that money in your flight bag -- Is it tempting?
Kinda.
You already knew that?
Beaumont Livingston?
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
He said he didn't know about it.
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
He told me to go outside.  "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
What were you two fighting about?
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
How long you been with Ordell?
Gimme one anyway.
Uh-uh.
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
Killian's.
Great...  ...Wanda!
Sure.
Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
I'm waiting for the phone.
Buy ya a beer?
Oh, hi.
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
Where you gonna be during all this?
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
Designer clothes.
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
What does she think she's gettin?
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
I was there, I saw her do it.
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
I need to talk to you alone.
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
Who?
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
Plus the same deal as before.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
Can you cover that?
That's the idea.
No, I give it to someone else first.
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
If you want.
I don't know. One of your friends.
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
It's true, isn't it?
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
They already know it's you.
I told them.
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
I do okay.
It's a cockatoo.
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
The Cockatoo Inn.
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
All your money's in Mexico.
One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail.
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?
Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
Go sit over in that chair.
I said, you understand what I'm saying
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga.
What do you think it is?
They told me.
I didn't tell 'em anything.
And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
Beaumont Livingston.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
They asked.
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
For what?
Sure.
Yeah.
I got some vodka in the freezer.
I was expecting you. Come in.
Okay, Lou-is.
You sure?
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
You sure?
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
Fuck you. I can carry it.
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
Are you sweating?
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
All right already.
...and just take it from him.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
Please.
He went to meet that stewardess.
That's not what I'm saying at all.  You know where he went?
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
Is it dead?
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
Wanna fuck?
Not really. We didn't have much to say to each other anyway. I never got to know him that well, but I knew enough to know I wasn't missing much. I keep that, because of all the fuckin' time I was there, that's the only picture I got of me in Japan.  That's Japan.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
About five years ago.
I lived there for about nine months.
That's a picture of me in Japan.
Did you ever go I one?
C'mon, don't lie.
Were you a disco guy?
With Ordell?
Where were you?
That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
Yeah.
Fourteen.
Which one?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
Want a Metrix?
Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time.
You okay?
Yeah, there's another hit left.
Really, I'm impressed.
What for?
Four years?
How long?
Where at?
When did you get out of jail?
Want a hit?
He's just repeating shit he overheard. He ain't any more a gun expert than I am.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
It's boring, isn't it?
No problem.
I was gonna tell you...
Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
'Ola!
It's Beaumont.
You know it's for you.
You know who I am.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Sit down!
Sit down, Jake.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Oh?  Where you going?
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
You can have anything you want.
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Jake, what is it?
You look upset.
What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
You've lived with me for two years.
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved your friends. That chemist - the Ladder. What an imagination you have!
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Sit down.
Sit down, Jake.
Oh yeah?  Try leavin' without me.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
Please.
Bullshit!
I can waitress. I'm good.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
It's so hard to believe.
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
What's gotten into you?
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
Are you out of your mind?
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
How do you know he's telling the truth?
How?
Who was that?
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
It might be for me.
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
I want to know. You tell me!
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
Who else were you expecting?
It's just me.
Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight.  Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something.
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
He said you didn't have one.
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
While you were in the shower.
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
How come? The army?
Remember that.
I know.
We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
You're right here, Jake. You just rest.  The doctor said you had a virus. That's what they say when they don't know what it is. You can't do anything for a week. He says you gotta recuperate.  Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken soup. It'll warm you up.
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
Here. I'll do it.
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Lie down!
What kind of man are you?
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
That's your decision.
Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.
He's coming right over.
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
Get your clothes off!
Get your clothes off.
The numbers stop at 107.
It's gone to the top.
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
Can't you stop it?
Hey, I'm here.
Why? What for?
What do you mean? Where do you think?
We're at Della's.
Oh, come on. It's early.
You okay?
Come on. What were they, Jake?
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
It's still there, Jake.  Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ...
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
'Cause she's always on your mind.
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
I enjoy crushing into you.
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
What's wrong?
Jake!
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
I don't like things that make you cry.
Is that the one who died?
Not to me.
Look at her face. A real bitch.
Why you left.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
Lemme see.
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
The best.
A good lay.
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
I don't let anybody call me that.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
They're weird names.
No. The little one.
Your kid dropped it off.
Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
Did you look around the headboard?
Where'd you leave 'em?
You up?
What happened to you?
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
The room!
What do you think?
That help?
I moved the couch. That's all.
Where are you?
Gee, thanks a lot.
Why didn't you turn on the light?
Jake, is that you?
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
Pour it in.
He doesn't like it.
Bring it in.
I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you.
You must shut down the engines.
Now this is getting exciting.
Now that's just gross.
The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. And look at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
You need to get laid!
I'm afraid I cannot assist.
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
Kay-em 14.
I love you.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.
A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
Oh, alright.
Do I have to?
Who are you apologizing to?
Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
Ow!
It's just you and me, then.
Sory...
I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
I didn't say I was good at it.
Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . .
The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
What'll I tell the kids?
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
You going to be all right?
Home... New York?
Can you do that?
Thank you.
Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
It's three feet deep, Martin
He's sitting in it.
Mikey loves his birthday present.
Can you stand something to eat?
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
Be careful.
Older, sillier.
I think they make you look sexy.
Don't forget these.
Don't be silly - You're going to make summer better for them...
You want to go through those?  I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.
I never hear the whistle.
Like you're from N'Yawk.
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'
Do you see the kids?
'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Is that a boat?
You're leaving?
You love sharks?
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
Would you like something? Some coffee?
So would I. Come on in.
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Okay.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
Yeah. That was me.
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
Huh?
Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. I'm a planet!
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
I still have your virginity!
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
What?
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
Leah just told me you were going with her.
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
I totally heard you did.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
Were we together?
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
Jesus, Bleek.
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
I'll try to drop by later.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
Charisma?
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
So that's cool with you, then?
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
I know.
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
I'm pregnant.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
Hey Bleek.
You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
What is your job title, exactly?
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
What? I'm not made of stone.
Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
Nails? Really?
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
Oh, go fly a kite.
Wow, dream big!
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
We don't even have a dog!
I know enough.
You don't know anything about me!
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
The term "deliver" is so weird. Can we not say "deliver"?
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
Cool it.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
No.
Well, I'm not ready to be a mom.
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
Oh, God...
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Hon, did you get expelled?
I have no idea how to spit this out.
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
Shit, yeah. Close it up.
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
I'm a junior.
Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes!
Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.
Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
But you're old!
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
No.
What?
I don't know.
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
Oh, okay. Like this.
Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
You do?
What?
Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
Cool.
Is Vanessa here?
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Consider it your musical education.
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
Why?
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Why? What the big deal?
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Uh, thanks.
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
The Wizard of Gore?
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
You don't have to do that.
Hey, I like this.
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
What is it?
Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
Yeah?
You know... it's parts...
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
No, he's the dad.
I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
Oh.
Like what?
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
Why aren't you at work?
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
That's all right. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. Franklin was the hot one with the polio.
Your guitar is named Kimber?
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
When was this, like '96?
Yeah.
What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
I rock a Harmony.
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
Blood and guts.
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy.
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
No.
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
Really? Fingernails?
Well, it was nice seeing you.
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
You should try Adderall.
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
Nothing.
Juno? What's going on?
Wow! It's magical.
Elbow.
Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
No...
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
Oh my God...
This is the baby. Your baby.
What...
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
Is the baby okay?
I went to the doctor today.
Then what's going on?
Nothing...
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Look, if I could give it to you now, I would. But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point, so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know?
Oh really?
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
Room with a toilet, got it.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
You found us in the Penny Saver?
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
Sure.
Can I take your coats?
Vanessa, right?
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
Congrats.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
Juno MacGuff.
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
Thundercats are go!
Or...
Either I just pissed my pants or...
What?!
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
I sort of already have.
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
Tore up from the floor up?
Please stop now.
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Dad, no!
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Yeah, like people in love.
You mean like couples?
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
Yeah, she does.
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
Hi Dad.
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
Excuse me?
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
What?
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
Who is the kid?
I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!
You're pregnant?
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.
I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Eww, he's all beardy!
Keith's hot.
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
Well, you are kind of... convex.
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Hot!
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
Right, seriously.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
I just thought she'd look really old in real life.
You sound shocked or something.
No way! She's pretty.
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
What?
Hly shht!
Share the love, Tits!
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
Or stage parents!
How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
Aw, please Junebug?
It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
Touche.
Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!
I'm pregnant.
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one.
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
You're not listening to me.
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other."  "All that's missing is your bastard."
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
The Penny Saver sucks.
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
There are ads? For parents?
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
It was magnificent, man!
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
Aha! You love him.
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
That is sick, man.
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
Unfortunately, yes.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
Dude, I'm pregnant.
Only the one in my pants.
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
Is this Juno?
I am a suicide risk.
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
What do you make with that?
A Pilates machine?
So. What's that thing?
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
You don't say.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
Aren't you the cool guy?
A hotel?
Have you found a place to stay?
We're actually, finally doing this?
No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
Like what? Be a rock star?
What would be a good time for you?
She answered our prayers.
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
What are you referring to?
What?
What did you do?
Juno, what's the matter?
Can you see it?
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
And I disagree.
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
You guys are playing music?
I want to be a mommy so badly!
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
Are you looking for any other compensation?
There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
You lose!
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
That's not true!
What?
...That's not true.
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
Jeez... Adele!
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
...Anything else?
Carryin' a gun.
What's Early been in jail for?
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
Yeah.
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
Adele... are you serious?
Do what?
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
Hold still.
No it is not!
That's me.
Took 'em all.
You took this picture?
Sure.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
It's a portfolio of my work.
What's this?
Could I try that?
I'm cool.
You can?
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
How'd you meet Early?
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
He whips you?
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
So you don't do any of those things.
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
You dropped this.
...Yeah, sure.
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
Not really.
Is it hard to learn?
...Yeah.
Are you takin' the pictures?
That French ain't it?
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
What?
Karma.
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
...Thank you.
...I said, I like your hair.
...Pardon?
Carrie.
Hi, I'm Adele.
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
Early! Stop!!
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
...I don't know.
...thank you.
I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
Early, what're you doin'?
Early, sing me a song.
Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
Geez, they look kinda weird.
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
What if they're dangerous?
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
What'll we do out there?
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
Almost.
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
Early, you are so sweet.
What about you?
What are you going to do?
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do!
Brian I want him out of our car!
Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
I'm finished.
What's that?
Look again!
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
She told me...  ...but only when she "deserves" it. Did you know he was in jail?
Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her.
You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
Fuck!
I don't want to talk about it.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
Up yours.
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
Funny, very funny.
I still think we should have met them first.
What did he sound like on the phone?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
A book on the warehouse murders?
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
Why?
So how's it going?
Thanks. What are you doing?
Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
The party?
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
Thank god!
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
Not yet.
...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
...You're hurting me...
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
Early, just think...
Siesta.
No, never. Excuse me.
No.
...Brian hurt his foot.
No, thanks, I can manage.
Where's Adele?
Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.
Yes!
Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Yes.
With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Umm. Altogether?
17.
Casper, where is he?
Casper, where's Telly.
Casper.
Do you care about me?
I don't want you to hurt me.
Nothing?
But I'm scared Telly.
How do you know?
I'm nervous.
I like you too.
Come on.
Uh huh.
Yes.
Yeah?
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Tonight?
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
I thought you had a girlfriend.
You were?
At the block party?
You have?
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
Hold on.
Right now?
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Hey.
No...
No, Fidget, I...
What is it?
Who are they?
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Telly is at Steven's?
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
What?
But I only had sex with Telly.
I tested positive?
What?
No.
One.
15.
Your a real philosopher.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Yeah?
Thanks.
Yeah?
No.
No.
Yeah, I guess so.
Everything is wrong.
Sorry.
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
Yeah.
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
What?
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
No. I just gotta go find him.
I'm coming.
I gotta find him.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
I only did it once and...
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
Good luck.
Wish me luck.
And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
I hate sucking dick!
Mine are like my neck and my chest.
Mine?
Like where are your erogenous zones?
Hell yeah, they don't know.
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
Boom!!! Boom!!!
Passion...
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
Foreplay. Foreplay.
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
No, I didn't bleed.
You didn't?
I didn't bleed.
Did you bleed?
I know.
You are being ripped open.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
The pain. The fucking pain!
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
You still mad at him?
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
Telly says was up.
Who, Benny's little sister?
Do you know where he went?
What happened?
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
Just a lot of crazy shit.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
And the other person I just fucked, which was a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie.
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
Yeah I get bored.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Yeah it's the biggest disappointment!
Yep.
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
It's really slow. It's slow boring.
Yeah.
It's like...
Making love is like.
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
You can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. It's so disgusting.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
It was... it was.
To come?
He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
It's very monotonous.
It's grandmother style.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
He was with me?
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
What do you mean, stand out?
A few people.
Maybe you're reaching a bit?  I think Sanderson should be in on this. There's a reason why the killer's calling him.
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
He's one of the best Chess players in the world.  Who better to play a game with?
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down, David.
I know, but this isn't going to bring her back.
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead.  You can't undo it.
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
Come here.
Why did he?
He already did once.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
I just can't believe it.
Fuck off!
Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
Nice meeting you.
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
Of course.
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
Is your dad here?
I'm Kathy.
You must be Erica.
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
You don't have a shred of evidence!
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
What does that mean?
What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
About a quarter to one.
As large as castles.
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
He moves around a lot.  Why?
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
Meaning?
I would think it's some type of clue as to where he's going to kill next?
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
But we heard him.
--Edmonds.  I know.  You lost to Karpov in '82, didn't you?
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
I'm busy right now.
What do you think he did?
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
What are they, please?
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
There's a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you.  You made a difference.
You beat him.
Yeah.  I'll be there later.
You're going to be late for your match.
Of course not.
He didn't tell you either.
No he didn't.
How did you know it was "carefully"?
It could be anything.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
Why not?
Why?
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
Peter...
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
Hi.
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
What?
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
For emphasis?
Peter...
Peter, you have to admit--
Nothing.
I tried again and got through.
They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
The line was busy.  I'll try again.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
What do you want on it?
I'm hungry.
You can turn everything around so easily.  This is not just another game, is it?
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
You've got to face the things you feel.
Then show me who you are.
Does anyone?
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
And you?
It must've been very hard on Erica?
I'm sorry.
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
No.  You were talking about chess.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
I'm sure you are.
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
Because I think he's wrong.
No.
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
How could you?  Unless you were there.
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
No -- I'm not involved.  And I plan on keeping it that way.
No.
Because I work with them.
Of course.
You have to win every point, don't you?
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
That's not fair!
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
Let's change the subject.
Of course.
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
How can you look at it so clinically?
This isn't a game.
Another kind of game?
Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
You sound like my mother.
I don't think I could.
What if she isn't?  Where are your priorities?  You have to think between someone's life and a chess game?  The girl he killed last night was only twenty one years old!  He dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage!
She could be dead after the game.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
We need your help.
They couldn't break the riddle.
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
Well, I think I've had enough.
Well, I hope you remember that tomorrow when you play Krikorian.
You.
Do you always open quickly?
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
That's a very personal question.
--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
Sounds very violent.
It seems like such a complicated game.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
Are you one of the players?
Are you with the tournament?
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.
Is this your first time here?
It's alright.
That's a better one.
That way. I can feel the cold.
Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.
I knew you would come.
Yes.
All directions are the same here.
I don't know how.
All the passages are guarded.
Colwyn ...
Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
I know it.
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
Colwyn ...
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
Colwyn.
About what?
I can't.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you.
We're almost married.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
I have no intention of getting used to it.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
Me too.
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
He will come for me.
He will not!
It's a lie!
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
It will not help.
Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
No.
You lie!
Why must you know?
Of what?
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Yes.
Those are reflections.  <u>This</u> is my face!
Do not try your trickery on me!
I killed him when he was born.  This place is my punishment.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
You had a son.
She bore you many children?
She was not as beautiful.
But you would not stay with me.
I was beautiful then.
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
Who speaks that name!
...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
...Office 2702.
Give me his name, I will mail him.
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
What's that man's name?
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
...What?
No.
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
No?
You say it just to calm me!
No, no! I don't want to go!  I don't want!
No! I don't want to leave you!!
How shall we get out now, Leon?
I don't know... Five minutes.
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
I don't know... Getting far away, the two of us, for example...  And forgetting all this...
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
What do you do, with the money you earn?
May I ask you a personal question?
Yes.
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you?  You met anyway?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
How many girlfriends did you have?
...Don't you like me?
...Don't you drink?
Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?
Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
I love you so much, Leon.
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death.  For the moment, I have none of the two!
Risky business, isn't it?
Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
A little...
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
What shall we do?
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
...OK.  I love you anyway.
When I say I love you.
...You don't believe me, don't you?
Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
...I'm going to kiss you.
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
Why?
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
May I go to the cinema?
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
Yes.
...Because I feel it.
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you!
You were scared, weren't you?
OK.
There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?
It's incredible! How did you do it?
Yes, yes...
The yellow and pink.
OK.
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
The fat man down there, on the bench.
Who'll I aim at?
Wow! It's brilliant!
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
What, for example?
How can you say it?
Huh... 500 meters?
OK, I'm fine.
I have no fear.
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
...I got lost, Mister.
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
...No... he's my lover...
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
...Composer.
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
Fine...
Can I sit on the stairways now?
...And how much is it?
Huh? Why?
I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
Why am I such an authority?
What is it?
Where?
I won't let you die.
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
What?
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
Maybe later.
Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
Why did you take the back roads here?  They're not safe.  You'd know that if you'd planned.
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
What if you don't make it?
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
It's impossible.
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
I don't accept that.
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
Thank you.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
Good.
No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?
If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
Maurice?
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
Pacifica, California.
I know where my heaven is.
I think it's a different place for each person.
That's okay -- really it is.
Your father?
It'll make it.
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
Don't be so sure.
You can change.
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
Yes.
I want children.
I've changed my mind.
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
You like to take walks?
Show me.
Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
Then why?
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
Why do you polish it?
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
No I don't.  I don't even know if you'd walk across the street for me.
Anything?
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
What it is -- is the truth.
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
We can do it together.
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
What?
Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
It's just a regular day.
There was no card.
The flowers... they're beautiful.
Yes.
Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale.
There are limits.
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
Let's stay for a while.
Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
They wouldn't know.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
Yes... I'll give you that.
I don't understand any of that.
What was that all about?
Your color.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
Be careful.
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
How are you doing?
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.
I am planning to go out and do some work.
Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth.
Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
I know that...
No?
Well... OK...
Why?
OK.
Ben?
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
What?
Don't you like me, Ben?
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
It's not about sex, Ben. I'll make you up a bed on the sofa. Do it for me. We can talk till late and then sleep till late. As you know, I am my own boss.
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. I mean...
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
Want to kill yourself? Are you saying that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself?
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
Very clever.
Yes.
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
Thank you. What time is it?
You OK?
You OK out there?
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait.
No, I can't have dinner with you.
Are you serious.
What's up?
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
To death?
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
OK... whatever.
Do you want to fuck now?
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
Mind if I use the bathroom?
You were going to get my door.
I sometimes fade out.
I guess I do too.
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
No, this is fine. I was just wondering.
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
No -- S.E.R.A.
You're pretty drunk.
Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
Hello.
Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
Where are you staying?
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
Yuri... are you...
No.
It's me, Yuri.
Don't hit me.
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
Where have you been staying?
I am lonely, Yuri.
I've been all right.
Please, Yuri.
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.
I have a 4.0.
That's right.
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
I believe you! Don't worry.
No!
I know! You helped me go from a six to a four!
How?
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
Who could better understand than me?
He means well. He's really brilliant and all.
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
Sort of.
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
His dead body with a bullet in it.
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
No.
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, Chutney? After you shot your father?
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
That's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate?
Because they got wet.
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to. Curls really weren't the right look for her --  She didn't have your bone structure.
Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
How many, would you say?
Yes.
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
Yes.
Where you got in the shower.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
Yes. I was washing my hair.
But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
I guess.
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
No. I was in the shower.
Did you hear a shot fired?
No, she'd stashed it by then.
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
Tell him, Paulette.
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
I'm Elle Woods. Ms. Bonafante's attorney.
Dewey Newcomb?
But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?
Yes, I am.
So everything you just said --
You're hitting on me?
Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
I'm sorry, but --
Thank you.
Is everything okay?
Thank you!
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!
Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
See?
Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.
For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
Why didn't you call me?
He chose them already?
What's going on?
What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law school don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding myself -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else. It turns out, I am a joke.
You can't go home!
Of course I can believe it. You're going to make a great lawyer.
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
How'd it go at the trial?
I'm so happy for you!
And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
Good one.
I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman.
What's the point?  Look at me.
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
Which must be a nice vacation for his balls...
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
God, that felt great!
Yes, you are. Go -- you can do this.
No.
You ready?
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
Definitely! I love him!
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.
Is she?
Is she as pretty as you?
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
That's terrible!
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
No!
I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.
Cried a lot and gained twenty pounds. Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus. I got jackcrap.
What'd you do?
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
After you went to all that trouble?
Spill.
You can't even imagine.
Delta. Gamma.
I'm her sister.
Uh -- family.
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
You're pawning The Rock?!
Yes, he is.
Yes, you are.
What?
Really?
You're kidding!
I know. He has it sent out.
Really? Thanks.
It's not my alibi to tell --
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
You know her?
Not yet.
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
Margot!
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
I will...
Keep June first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. And give Warner our love.
No way --
Josh proposed!
What?!
Picking out my wedding dress!
Power yoga?
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
My lucky scrunchie. It helped me pass Spanish.
Your scrunchie?
Here. You're gonna need this.
I have the highest GPA in Delta Gamma!
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!
So?
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
Thank you. I love you, too.
We still love you. Sisters forever!
Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming...
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
Too demure?
You think?
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
You guys are so sweet!
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
Is he the only one?
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
Are you asking me on a date?
Oh, my God!
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
I'm quitting.
Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
For a butt-head? Yes.
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
She's not!
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
No, she can't move for an hour.
Maybe not to your face...
Because people aren't always what they seem to be and you refuse to see that. Have a little faith. You might be surprised.
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
But maybe it's not what you think.
A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
Why?
Aside from that.
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
Don't ask.
Thanks again for your help!
Wow. I'm glad I met you.
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
Neat.
Did she do that to you, too?
And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
What're you doing here?!
Really --
What?
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
Almost.
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
I just don't understand what went wrong --
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
No -- it's just -- not me.
But I'm not positive it's gonna happen tonight --
Of course, I do!
Maybe she found him like that.
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!
And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it?  See you tomorrow!
I do.
I don't know --
I did?
I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
I'd rather have a client who's innocent.
Neither.
I guess it'll have to...
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
Huh. Imagine that. Looks like I am.
In court. On opposing sides.
Really?
Thanks for the backup.
See?
I gave her my word, Warner.
Thank you.
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
Thank you. Having fun?
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
Do anything exciting?
Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  How was your summer?
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
What, like it's that hard?
Harvard. Law school.
No, silly. I go here.
I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
No.
Then what? My boobs are too big?
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
I completely agree.
And I fully support that.
Of course.
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
So are you!
Pull up next to him!
Yeah, luckily.
Why?!
Let's all go! Road trip!
Cunnilingus?
You're right. Phew!
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
It's not a Theta --
Elle?
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
Might we watch, too?
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
What was that?  Did you hear that?
You're a beast!
I don't expect you'd understand.
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
I see...
What will become of me then?
And then?
Oh, yes...
What do you want from me?
Don't please... I'll do what you desire...
No more... please...
Kill me... I want... so nice...
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
Do it now!
Damn you!
I'd soon die.
Why have you brought me here?
Do you feed on mice and rats?
Like some vile toadstool.
Protection?
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
And you... are you not also afraid?
You... you're a beast!
God protect me.
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
Grotesque... monstrous...
But I'm hideous!
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
What do you want with me?
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
I can't see a thing.
Pinching?  Where?
Biting you?
What's the matter?
And I love you, my husband.
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other.
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
And I... love you...
In the dark... where I join him...
That's why he goes masked during the day...
Sunlight... It destroys him.
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
You've freed me, Jack...
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
Only what's right...
Jack... Forgive me...
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
Then, perchance you'll me.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
Oh, la...
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
I don't want it on me.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
My own father...
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
My father and the Baron.
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
Where are you going?
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
He'll not flee if I show myself?
Jack!
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
How much longer?
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
Oh, dear.
What shall we do?
I detest serpents.
A gentleman would offer water.
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
A promise is a sacred oath.
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
Liar!
But you did... you did!
You promised!
If you like.
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
You'll visit again?
Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
Dead, dead, dead.
She's dead!
As fair as me?
Is she fair, this princess?
Princess?  I know of no princess.
Ask away, sweet man.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
Why then, there thou hast.  We be lucky worse has not befallen us.
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
What's this now?
True north...  Straight up that pass, through the net.
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart!
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
You... you... you mortal you!
What shape I take matters not.  Long you for another?  I'll give you your heart's desire.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
And sweet?
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
Jest with me then.
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
And am I not fair?
Do I not please you, Jack?
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
Only that?
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
No need for bells, Jack.  I'll nay enchant ye.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
Sorry.
Courage, Jack.
It's so beautiful.
He's here.  Check the bathroom.
I guess it depends on what you give up on.
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
Since seventh grade.
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
I thought I might stop by.
Who are all these people?
I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
I'm going to bed.
Uh...using Josh like that.
I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not.
What are you doing up so early?
You'd better call and cancel.
And why was the alarm on?
What's wrong?
Mom?
I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam.
It's not what I was expecting.
My mother would die.
Did you feel anything?
I want you to try something with me, okay?
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
What's that?
Monday.
Nope.
Is that legal?
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
No.
He seems lonely.
Sorry I got you into trouble.
What?
Where are you?!
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
Not if what he left me was real.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
What?
Are you afraid of heights?
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
I thought I was helping you.
Not really.
I was wondering.
Josh said...
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
Does everything have to have a point?
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Why are you so uptight?
We're not gonna do anything.
I'm coming in.
I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
I'm okay.
Huh?
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
Turn over.
I wanted him to marry her.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
I'll get your back.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
You look better without make-up.
Tell him I said "hi".
Where's your dad?
You should stay.
Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
Where to?
What are you doing here?
Hi.
No.
Will he talk to me?
He won't leave my room.
He's not the type to worry.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
He's at work while I'm here.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
Why is that?
He's got a standing invitation.
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
I mean, but did you both go camping on weekends?  Listen to music?  Masturbate together?  Talk on the phone?
Are you guys' friends?
It could have been a squirt gun.
IPO's caused the rat population on this street.
This is such a street of whiners.
I better get the kids home.
Don't move!
Are you going to kiss me?
I could die.
Back.  Neck.  Back.
'I'll be in the bedroom.'
No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
Peter left me yesterday.
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
Is your back still killing you?
I need to know.
If I weren't married?
I'm married.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
You've never said that before.
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
I thought we were helping.
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
What is it with this?  They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here!  He has no time!
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
I smiled at him.
This was my very first slow dance.
Do you need help?
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
Where's Sam?
Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
You're not well.
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
I dreamed about your house last night.
I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
Do you remember?
What have you been before today?
Sam's favorite.
The first and the last.
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
I used to live here.
It makes me sad.
Well, for later then.
George --
I did say he could go.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
Last time you were gone for a week!
I drove over and you were gone.
What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
I'm married.
No, you don't.  Trust me.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
One of you would end up dead.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
Where will you live?
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
Money?
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
Why call me?
Why would they tow your truck?
But you can't call me while you think?
What did you do with your dog?
Where have you been for a week?!
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
What?
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead!
Because he put the lock on!  Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?  I don't know anything, anymore!
He never answers.
What are you doing?
Where he always is.
Lock the door behind you.
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
Ring the bell before you try the door.
I feel in love with George again.
I hardly recognize you with a beard.
Sam took them to a movie.
That's the problem.
Despite you.
You never really trusted me.
What are you doing home?
I know.
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
I can't go right now.
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
I'm helping George build his house.
After the kids are back in school.
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
The biggest waste of time since television.
To shave your chest?
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
It would worry me.
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
I'll make you something.
We've eaten.
A man he respects.
I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
You could keep it and rent it out?
You're sure about this?
I don't know what I'm doing.
Can you stay for dinner?
I didn't go in your room.
In the bedroom.
Go tell your father we're eating.
Nothing R, okay?
Would you stop being ridiculous?  Your father wants Sam home as much as I do.
Adam, that's not true!
I brought a few of my own.
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
I just thought it would be nice.
What did you say?
He'll be gone for his birthday.
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
I'll call her later.
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
You're already there...
It would be so okay.
I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
Yeah, you do...
She's so nice.
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
Angels don't get any older, son.
Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
Try an angel.
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
Maybe try the opposite of that.
I love you.
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
Nicky!
Don't do it.
"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
We're going to Jersey?
Can we go fly over Central Park?
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
..."The Devil?"...
Yes...
What do you mean, "possessed?"
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
Why would you be floating?
What are you doing?
Are you dead?
What were you thinking coming here?
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
What was that?
What?
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
Basically, yeah.
Sometimes, sure.
My perfume?
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
You have a dog? What kind?
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
"Octopus people?"
If you want to.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
My dad's an optometrist.
Why are you laughing?
Really?
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
When do you go up?
Why aren't you in Nursery?
Where do you live, Mary?
What's your name?
Is it inside the city?
What does that water do?
Beloved husband...
And Sanctuary?
"Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.
You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
To what?
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!!
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
There's a Sanctuary... there is!
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?
Then the answer's yes...
...But I still have the choice...?
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
What does it mean?
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
Don't ever let go.
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
Don't!
I hate outside! I hate it!
And yours.
What's that?
For us.
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
I'm afraid.
Ycch.  To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world.
What do you suppose this was...?
How do we know this is the right way?
Will you take me with you?
They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
We'll convince them.
They won't listen.
They won't believe us.
He's good, isn't he?
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
No. Not that either.
I -- I can't.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
Muscle? I don't know that one.
But what is this -- why?
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
I have.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
Some people say children need human mothering.
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
I'd rather be with you.
You're not going, are you?
We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
Of course --
I wish I knew what you think I know.
I wish I could help you.
What're you going to do?
What do you need?
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
Please? What friends?
I don't..
And then you killed him, right?
Where did you get that?
How can I?
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
About running, dying what?
Why tell me?
Why show me?
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
Then it's still no.
Thanks... but I have the choice.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
Here I am.  Shall I come in?
You could have called me yourself.
K.
Six. I go red next year.
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
Why is it wrong to run?
I'm afraid to tell you.
Not about that.
How a Sandman lives.
Curious.
I changed my mind.
I thought I had to do something.
No.
No.
Jessica.
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
He was killed.
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
No.
No.  Just no.
Please... No.
Goodbye.
Come with us.
We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
At least it's over...
What's that?
What people?
What belongs to the people?
No.
I don't know.
Are you sure?
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key.
No.
No. Fred hates them.
What is?
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
Up the stairs - down the hall.
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
You killed him.
You all right?
You got him.
Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
Are you my man?
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
Set.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
So, should I call Andy?
If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
Pete... Don't...
Yeah.
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
He works for Mr. Eddy.
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
I used to.
No... no.
I don't know.
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
He'll kill us.
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
I'll call you again.
Pete?
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
I can't see you tonight.
It's me...
Okay, baby.
Can I call you?
I want more.
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.
Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
I was here yesterday.
Was there?
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
But...
I thought you were getting me a drink?
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
Why would anyone do something like this?
On the tape! There was something else on the tape.
What was that?!!!
What the hell is going on?!
We will.
Two detectives are coming out.
We've got to call the police.
I guess so.
Yes, I just found it on the step.
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
Yeah?
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
Called? When?
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
What night?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
It must be from a real estate agent.
No, nothing.
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
A videotape.
Wake me up when you get home.
I like to laugh, Fred.
I thought I'd stay home and read.
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
YOU'RE SORRY!!
What's the BITCH'S name?!
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
I didn't know you cared.
I was?
Where'd you come from?
Why don't you like me?
I don't know.
What do you want?
No... I really don't want to talk about it.
I don't want to talk about it...
It was weird...
You really don't remember?
You still care about me?
You were acting like a different person.
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
Last time I saw you.
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
Why haven't you called me?
You want some company?
What are you guys doin'?
Yeah.
I missed you.
I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
Why?
Would you like to wring my little neck?
Why, mother?
I was just going to.
Why?
Struggling, why?
Why?
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
You see, it's not a dream.
Bump?
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
I'm so glad.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
What is?
I'm thirty.
Yes, I know.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
Yes.
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
I saw a man whose life was empty.
That was easy. I read your books.
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
Oh, you mean my pigeons.
My name's Sondra.
Yeah ... ?
What are you doing?
Are you sure you don't?
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
Out of focus?
What the hell does that mean?
What do we do?
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
Well, first of all, it's entomologist.
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
Do have any idea what I just said?
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.
So... how'd you hear about this?
Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
Really nice wheels, by the way.
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
The what?
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
Come again?
I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
Scientific American?  Really?
RUN!
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
She grew up.
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
I am going back.  I see myself there.
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
The other two will die without me.
I have to go back.
Where are we going?
But you still have a choice.  The others never had a chance to see their future.  You did.
Please, I want to go back...
Anderton --
What is it?
Please --
Anderton, leave.
Wait.
He won't.
No.  Follow him.
Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
Drop some money.
Can you see the balloon man?
Take it.
They're inside.
Is it now?
Is it now?
Can you see?
John?  What is it?
I know... I do, too...
About who?
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
Found?  Where?
Then who was he?
The female.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
If... you have one.
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
The safest place of all.
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
Hold that thought.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
Do you?  Really?
The system would collapse.
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
I can't help you.  No one can.  The Precogs are never wrong.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.
You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
And how would I know that?
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
Something wrong?
Then how did he --
Oh, God, what did you do?
John?
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
Lamar --
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
He also said Crow was a fake.
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
I thought you were retiring?
You look great.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
I haven't seen him in two years.
To what?  Trap him?
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
Yes.
It was nobody's fault.
Since right after we lost our son.
That was our apartment.
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
No.
I don't have any sugar either.
We used to, every summer.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
Yes.
I know who you are.
I want you to take her with you.
Take her.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Goodbye, Bobby.
I never promised you anything.
Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again.
Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
With what?
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
Shhh. He'll hear you.
Ho's a good guy --
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
Yeah? You sure?
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Oh, please.
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
Oh my god. What happened?
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
Where were you?
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
Dear heart, where are you?
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
Dear heart, I love you.
Shhh!
Get some sleep.
Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a day; but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind. If you won't do that for yourself do it for us.
We need you too!
Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?
Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
The talk is everywhere!
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
I'm not made of glass.
Because you're in trouble.
The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.
I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
You're with me even when you're away.
Hush your mouth.
Just hold me.
Yes. Did you eat?
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
Yes.
I know.
Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
Why do you ask?
You have enough worries of your own.
I can handle it.
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
There's nothing to talk about.
How do you like it?
What?
You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.
Could we sit down someplace?
I see your point.
Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
If you want to tell me.
She ate.
You got that right.
Dyslexic?
I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
Frank. Frankie.
You think too much?
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
You don't drink like you used to.
Could I ask you a question?
I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
Why today? And why'd she have to go with him?
What's so important in Los Angeles?
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
The gunshot holds no fear.
Are you afraid of me?
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
Where's my mother?
You were never late before, I was worried.
You're late.
Did you used to?
Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
Yes.
I don't understand.
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
So how come you know so much about those countries?
[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
Yes.
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
My ankle.
Everywhere!
It hurts.
They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
It's better to be free, right?
How do you think he got out?
Maybe. Did you hear him?
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
I go to school, don't I?
I'm not crying.
Oh...
So you were unhappy?
Hmmm?
But why not?
Not at all?
Did you like school, Creasy?
We're taking a different way home.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
Someone gave him more money than we could.
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Potential? I don't understand.
Why not?
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
I know. But which state?
Where are you from, Creasy?
Creasy...
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
My last bodyguard. He drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon.
That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
Creasy... Wait.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.
Planned what?
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
Jordan!
The traffic takes some getting used to.
Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.
It makes it all seem so serious.
No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
How are you getting along with Pinta?
It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to... Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment?
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
You've done much of this work before?
You're American.
The world of our children. How dare they?
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
Don't forget your towel.
Bye, Mom.
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
He's like a great big bear.  'Creasy bear'...
You do?
I like him, Mom.
This is Mr. Creasy.
Yes, mom?
We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.
When?
Good news. You're going back to school.
I'm trying, mom.
You should be sleeping, baby.
She's young. She'll get over it.
He has to go.
It's not.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
Creasy.
He has to go, Samuel.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
She likes him.
You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
I think it's nice he's American.
Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed.
Our child's safety is at stake.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man. I'm tired-a running around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?"
That's the first time Marty ever brought a girl to this house. She seems like a nice girl. I think he has a feeling for this girl. You heard him sing. He been singing like that all morning.
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
Were the lights on?
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
Your son Marty?
Marty.
Who?
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
Catherine, my sister...
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
Catherine, you are very dear to me. We have cried many times together. When my husband died, I would have gone insane if it were not for you. I ask you to come to my house, because I can make you happy. Please come to my house.
I know it pains.
It pains that they should do this.
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.
My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
What they say?
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
When was this?
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
Who?
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
Ah?
Catherine, I want you come live in my house with Marty and me.
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
Ufa!
She gave me the evil eye.
What happen?
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
You told me.
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
Well, it ain't your baby.
That's my son Thomas's baby.
It's her baby too, you know.
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
Well, I always like to visit you, Catherine, because you always got such cheerful news.
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
Who?
Well, he died. You know who else died?
I don't think I remember him.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
Oh.
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
That's nice.
I feel fine.
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
I came to see you. How you feel?
Hey! What are you doing here?
Okay.
Okay.
We just live one flight up.
How do you do?
Nothing.
All right.
I'll wait for your call.
I'd like that very much.
Nothing.
Marty...
No...
No...
Marty...
No, Marty, please...
Maybe that would be a good idea.
Oh, I'm fine.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
Yes, I know.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Well, that's what I was saying. My father is getting old. And we're very close. He's a wonderful man, really...
...It's really a fine opportunity for me. But I'm not sure I want to be a department head. It's mostly executive and administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...
I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...
I really should get home...
I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
I don't.
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
Yes, I know.
Yes, I know.
Thank you.
Benjamin Franklin High School.
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
I'm having a very good time, too.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
Goodnight.
Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
Sure.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
You mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law. She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for.
Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
Well, siddown a minute. I just come inna house. I'll take off my coat. Siddown a minute.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
I don't like her.
She didn't look Italian to me.
I said, is she Italian girl?
She looks thirty-five, forty. She didn't look Italian to me.
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
Sure.
Sure.
Sure.
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
Marty...
You not ugly.
Put on your blue suit...
You gonna die without a son.
Marty...
You gonna get married.
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Tomatoes.
I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.
You gotta good heart.
Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
Hello, Thomas.
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking.
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
Sure, sure.
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
I'm gonna see you tonight...
That's all right, that's all right...
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
Well...
Sure.
Well, I don't know what you want me to do, Virginia. If you want me, I'll go talk to her tonight.
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
He coming home right now.
Yeah. Lavender and old lace!
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paperand forty heads are chopped off!
John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea what was going on.
Look, Johnwhat we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
I guess so. Then what happened?
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Ted Sheldon.
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
About me?
No.
No, thank you.
Uh-huh.
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Uh-huh . . .
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going
Hello, John.
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
John Doe, the one in the speech.
John Doe. The one in there.
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
Grab it, Eddie, grab it!
Yes!
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Against anything. Just protest.
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world!
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
Um-hum.
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Are you all right?
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letterand stick by it?
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
John! I'm so glad to see you. II was terribly worried.
Mr. D. B. Norton!
A third party?
Oh!
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. WellI don't quite know what to say . . .
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Better let me talk to him.
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much for everything.
How do you do.
A hundred dollars!
Oh, I'm sure I can.
Money.
Thirty dollars.
Yes, sir.
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
You bet I will, Ma.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
That's your father's diary, Ann.
Huh?
Wait a minute . . .
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
What?
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor
The Websters!
The Websters.
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseand then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
Thank you.
That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
What's the idea?
Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.  That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Take it easy, John Doe.
I got it all ready. Here.
Oh!
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract?
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomunder bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like thateating a sandwichand with a beard!
Oh.
When you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you.
That's our man. He's made to order.
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
Sorry.
Plus a bonus.
That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
Anybody! Er, erBeany'll do!
Well, you're catching on.
The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
John Doe.
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
Sure!  When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job!  A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doeand he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
John Doe.
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
There is no letter. I made it up.
There is no letter.
There is no letter.
Oh!
What letter?
What's that?
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
Oh, let me go, will you!
Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
Where's Connell?
Have you seen him?
Has he been here?
Colonel!
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Where'd you play?
Baseball?
What do you do when you work?
Had any schooling?
Prude.
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
You thought I was talking about getting married?!
I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
...the hell are you talking about?
Scott...
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
I've been thinking.
Scottie?
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
Scottie...
Scottie, Scottie...
I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
And you think he'll...
In Europe women find older men very sexy.
Yeah?
There is?
It's very nice.
How's Paco doing?
Just now.
It's okay. We broke up.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
Scottie...
Yeah that's it.
Mmm, needs a little something.
And it's hard to get.
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
It's already started.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
If you did, you never showed it.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
What do you want from me?
Scott, You can't save everyone.
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Maybe you should be.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
Hey.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
Greg.
You worship yourself.
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
There was no other choice.
I'm sorry.
What's the difference?
But you were with me.
I wasn't with you.
Way you kiss me.
And it meant something.
Realize?
For what?
Why?
But I don't know anything about programming.
You said we were on the same programming team.
Her?
That's not possible.  No one can do that.
-- The inside?
Who are you?!
What are you talking about?
Then how do you know about --
You went to my high-school?
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
Someone you have to get back to?
Tanner.
Some things never change, do they?
What brings you inside?
"4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's <u>not Stu</u> any more. The Stu I love is gone! <i></i> He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing.
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
Five CC's.
What's the maximum safe dose?
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Switch hands.
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
Yeah...before your time.
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
I don't know. I guess it was...
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
What'll it do if they pull the plug?
I don't want to <u>stop</u> the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to <u>scare him awake</u>.
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
He called me "Doc."
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
You sure this is...medically advisable?
What are you watching?
You're acting kind of...odd.
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
What's the matter?
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
Stu?
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
I don't think so.
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
What's the "bad" part?
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
Who?
Can't you give it to me later?
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
Kimmy! What's the matter?
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
The ring...
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
When'd you get in?
Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
And you don't deal drugs?
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.
Have a nice day.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
Mm hmm.
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
I can make my own decisions.
Mother!
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
I'd love to.
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
Mm hmm.
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
I'm sorry.
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
Aaron?
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Oh, I hope so, dear.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
Mom, I need to talk to you.
No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
What's wrong?
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
Mother, I ...
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
You know, you never tell me anything.
I don't want to talk about it.
He seemed quite taken with you.
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
But I was dusting.
Behind the books.
Well, they were right out in plain view.
Mother!
You know ...  ... whoops!
What pictures?
What about the fellow in those pictures?
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
Dating anyone?
I'm good.
How are you doing sweetheart?
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
... What are they all doing there?
Uh-huh?
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
You don't like where I live?
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
So, what do you think?
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
He's an organic farmer.
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
Who is it?
Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
I see.  How much?
This way?
You mean it's dangerous?
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute.
Are you sure you got my bag in?
Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State--  Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play *I'll* get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that, State--!  Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've written--let me have it--
What!
Diz!
Diz--get what he says to the people back in that State. It's up to you and the boys. Keep those wires hot. Fire away, pal!
The war's on!
Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
Why me?
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
Take me home, Diz.
Huh?
Right now--everything I own--!
I'm getting out of there. Right now, Diz. Right now. Bonus or no bonus. I'm gonna clear outa that office-- everything I own--my extra hat-- everything--
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
My first name's--Clarissa.
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
Where?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
No.
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Okay. You don't mind?
Any time.
How about getting married?
Diz--
*All right*, then. After all, what's it to me? So they *drop* him out of a balloon. All I care is--I don't want to be around. See? Squeamish. See? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. Won't be a party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. I'm through.
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--
Shut up, Diz.
--followin' Miss Susan Fass-Pass around--his little heart poundin' away--the sound of angels' wings in his ears.
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.
Yeah.
Drunks are funny--
Why do I always laugh at that?
And to Don Quixote!
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
Paine.
I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
That's taking place outside now.
Did you like the first act?
Diz--Don Quixote with bill is going to get to his feet in a minute and speak two important words--*Willet Creek*. When that happens--if my hunch is right--the Silver Knight will fall off his tightrope and Puss will jump out of his boots.
You play--left field.
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
Yes. Mostly "Puss."  Oh, the *other* prominent character in the play.
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
Certainly.  Now there's the principal actor in our little play.
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--!
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
Whadaya mean--*right*?
I'm still asking myself--what is he-- animal, vegetable, or mineral? A Senator! A United States Senator! I thought I'd seen everything but-- why, he doesn't know what time it is, Diz! When I think of myself sitting around--playing straight for all that phoney, patriotic chatter-- *me*, carrying bibs for an infant with little flags in his fists--no, I can't take it, Diz--I'm through--I quit!
Yeah. Should have seen me seven years ago--when I came to this town. *Now* what am I?--chambermaid to the Pied Piper of Jackson City; *Honorary* appointment! Scratch this thing an you'll find they wanted a dope here for two months.
What! Who?
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
Oh--that again. Yeah.
Huh?
What's this, Diz?
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
Tell me why!
Well, why don't they try the police-- get some blood hounds--or Indian guides--
No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?
Okay. For the dollar, I give you McGann *and* Bill and Carl. I got Paine.  Hello... Oh, yes.
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
I give that Trail Blazer five more minutes to show up--  --*five more minutes*!
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!
Well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say Jefferson Smith.
No wonder--without your dinner.
Otis!
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
Nonsense.
We're waiting, Hubert.
Dinner, Hubert.
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
Can't that wait, Hubert?
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
Great saints!
What is it?
What is it?
That infernal phone!
I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
To a hard night's work, son. Come on!
Hurray!
We'll *find* one! Only throw compromise out of the window--stick to Jeff Smith, the man who first came to this town--get up and *fight*-- and we'll find *some* way. I don't know where we'll wind up--but the flag'll be flying--!
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
What you *have* to do is fight!
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*!
Well, I guess it's a chance.
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
What are you going to do?
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
I'm not.
Hello.
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
Don't mention it--
Thanks a lot.
Do you want to dictate them?
Not another bill?
Second drawer.
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Must have been tickled pink.
Great.
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
No--
In Terry Canyon?
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
You win. It's--Clarissa.
No! Stop it!
No!
No!
It *is* not!
Well, if it's all the same to you--
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
I also answer to whistles.
Why?
Terrible, thank you.
Go right ahead.
I don't see where we are *with* it.
Have I?
No complaints.
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
Since sixteen or so.
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
No.
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
He did?
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
On paper?
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
Try sitting down.
Yes, Senator--*twice*.
Thanks very much.
Yes--sure. Why not?  You don't mind if I take the time to get a pencil?
Pardon?
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
What?
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
Good. Where are we?
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Committee.
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
A *day*!
Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Go ahead--punch.
You *couldn't*?
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
No. What had you better--?
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Convene?
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.
Well--he's got nothing on me.
Most natural thing in the world!
There *what* was?
Did you say--bus?
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
What's your name?
No!
*No*!
What is it?
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
Well--I--
Well! You don't say!
And how's your bill, Senator?
I'm splendid, too.
Splendid.
Goodnight, Senator--
Then you *did* say it.
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
How are the pigeons?
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
Wonderful!
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann--
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?
Well, well!
Go away, Nosey.
He did it.
So I go right back where I was-- carrying compromises--covering up-- back to political tricks--this time for--! No! I was just getting rid of all that. If I did *anything*, I ought to go and tell him to stand up and--. No! I don't want any part of it! Smith or anything else! I'm all through. I want to be left alone!
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
What are you talking about? What difference--?
Well--me, too!
Why don't you do it yourself?
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
What do you want, Senator?
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
Yeah?  And what else?
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
No?
Nice *compliment*!
Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
That's right.
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
You want to see me, Senator?
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
How nice. How do you do, Senator?
Father--oh.
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
I'm afraid we won't have room in the car, Father. Senator Smith can follow with Mr. McGann and the pigeons.
How nice.
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
Would you like to go for a walk?
Why not?
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
No. Are you?
Yes!!!
What's that got to do with it?
What's that got to do with it?
Oh, thank you!
It isn't all! I'd like to explain
Yes, but I
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
NO!!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes.
No! I resigned last week!
No!
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
Oh, hello darling.
Yes, of course.
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
A girl?
No, I don't mind.
I don't blame you.
Are you? When?
Let's just walk, okay?
Thank you.
Ready?
I'll get my hat.
You threw them out!
I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
I'd like to read it some time.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
It had better be good.
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
The drums. He taught me to play some.
Yeah, I know.
He played in the town band, too.
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
I've often thought about going back.
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
I'm from a small town too, you know.
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
What did you mean by that?
You said I was a lady in distress.
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
Here's a nice place.
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
Why don't you try?
There's Times Square.
Now, what do you see?
I say, to most people it's a washout.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
Yeah, let's.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
Uh-huh.
What are they going to do?
What did they say?
What did they say?
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
I enjoy it.
Oh, I don't mind.
Really?
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
What?
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Well, I guess I walked too much. I've been looking for a job all day. I found one, too. I start tomorrow.  You've been awfully kind. Thank you very much.
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
Hello.
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
We're not going out tonight.
Just a minute. No, you don't.
What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
You're acting like a school girl.
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
Running away is no solution.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
You're a fool, Babe.
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
Huh?
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
The guy's balmy.
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
Yeah, then what?
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
Why? Why do we have to do it?
People have been crucified before.
I'm crucifying him.
Uh-huh.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
Good night.
I can't write it, Mabel! I don't know what's the matter with me.
You haven't gotten very far, have you? That's where you were an hour ago. Come on, let's knock off and go down to Joe's. The gang's waiting for us.
Don't be ridiculous.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
No. It's nothing.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
Nothing.
What's the matter, hon?
Hello . . .
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
That's the rub.
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
I'm going to tell him the truth.
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
Yes.
Last night he proposed to me.
With pay!  She is out the door.
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
Had the boys follow us.
If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
Have lunch.
Leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow.
With pay!
Can I have a month's vacation?
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
Look, I can do it!
Thank you so much. Good night.
Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
You mean  by the neck or something?
Yeah. What?
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
-- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... And that's how I feel right now... Like I have some giant, all- day hall pass.
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer.  He liked to acquire things.
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids.
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
Why are they ganging up against me?
What do they want from me?  What have I done that's so wrong?  They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...  Even you probably have things.
Well, come on in.
You do?
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
I'd better get in there.
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
Oh?
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
Doc.
Doc...
...so accomplished.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
You're on your own today, honey.
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
No gentleman caller, Doc.  Not that I care. I've had it with men. They're so fascinated by their own crap. Took me four years to get the last one out. Almost turned me into a dyke... These days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed. Now that feels good. And you don't have to do all that... listening.
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
And the Brocketts?
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
Doc.  Ainge...
Not sure. Let me think about it.
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
How long you been in this town?
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
Who was that?
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
Mother... go away!
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
We're going for a walk.
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.
We're only talking about six weeks.
You got off easy.
What is your name?
...but first, you have to tell me something...
Oh.
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
What?
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
I am irate!
You deserve it.
You feel violated?
...How violated I feel?
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
Which show was that?
Mother...
I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities --
Hello?
Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion...  ...that I am in love with you.
Transference!
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
How intuitive! That must take years of training right there. Maybe you can guess what has upset me.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
Thanks to this therapy, I now know what I'm looking for. I need to find a man like you.  Not one who's treating me, of course.  And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've given me the confidence.
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
My brother said you were about to fire me.
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
Which thing?
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
And this is legitimate therapy?
It's all right.
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
And he's where?
So whose route is this?
No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
That was really bad, wasn't it?
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Is that like a party trick?
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
Where?
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Uh-huh.
Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble.  My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?...
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
Is this the treatment?
No.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
What?
Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, especially, but Dad, of course. She thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. It's what happens when you "marry beneath yourself"...
We don't discuss it.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
Mom's such a cutie.
Oh boy... this should be interesting.
I'm not making any promises.
Can I ask you something?  Didn't you tell my dad you didn't think it was a good idea to come to the patient?  So what changed?
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
I don't know. I barely made it today.
What would you do?
Even if you don't think it's real?
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I don't know how much longer I can put up with it. I already got two arms and legs, I don't need another appendage.
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.
First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
He said -- "Which we already knew!"
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
No. I don't know what he wants. But I know I don't like being watched. Nobody's ever paid any attention to what I did, and I liked it just fine. Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself?  Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo.
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
What are you talking about?
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous.
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something...
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew...
Have women found you attractive?
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
In maybe three or four issues.
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
Intestines.
Oh yes, always.
What just happened?
That's one way of putting it.
Exactly --
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
What is he doing here?
See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
What are you doing here?
Twenty.
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
I would never!
Three hundred pounds!
Two hundred pounds.
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
I am an English woman.
Where are they taking him?
And what did he say?
And what is he in prison for?
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
I have no choice.
Got it!
I think you were jealous
You called me your girl?
The creature!? Are you sure!?
I'm staying.
That's what I am to you? A contract?
It's everybody's problem!
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
Alright then, Me, I,... I read the book, I woke him up and I intend to stop him.
No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.
No, we are not.
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
Very slowly.
No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl.
No... Why?... Should I?
Why would I do that?
I'm not?
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe.
You two!
How?
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty.
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
For entering the afterlife.
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
That "thing" gets me excited.
For what?
Are you sure?
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
Oh that's comforting.
You know your history.
I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
If you call that a kiss.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
Yes.
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
What did you find? What did you see?
No, I mean --
You swear?
Yes, well...  I know my brother.
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
No?
We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
Broad?!
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
What's it look like!?
Finish the inscription, idiot!
Read the inscription on the cover!
Shut-up and get me off of here!
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
Well neither do I, thank you.
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
What do you suppose killed him?
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my.
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.
Do you really think he'll show up?
But he's just a filthy criminal?
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
I'm your sister.
You lied to me!
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
I think you found something.
Jonathan?
Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
Have you no respect for the dead?
You...! YOU...!
Stay away!
Who?
What?
I'd better go.
Curiosity.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Who's the artist?
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
Just wanted to... powder my nose.
Hi.
Sure -- I guess.
Really?
Just a waitress.
Really?
Bye.
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
Then at least I will have died trying, right?
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
I'm going inside.
At the Frankenstein Center.
It's me.
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
You don't seem very angry right now.
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
Yeah.
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
Have you always lived here?
What's your real name?
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
Who wouldn't?
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
I admire you.
That was easy.
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
Date?
Alone tonight?
Not tonight.
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something.
Here you go.
So what can I get you?
Really?
Wow.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Are you famous?
Really? Like Captain Amazing?
You guys going to a costume party?
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
Lisette La Croix.
Lisette.
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
Do you have three francs, sir?
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
Yes, I am, sir.
Yes, it must be.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
Good evening, sir.
Ah, well, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, peace of mind can eventually be a substitute for happiness.
Ah, that is good.
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress.
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
Who is it?
In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream.
But you will not... be safe...
Separate bedrooms?
Five minutes.
Five minutes.
Will you be joining us, soon?
What are you doing in there?
Where is Madame Trillaud?
I know what you're doing in there.
Open the door.  It's me.
You are my old friend.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
Promise.
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Promise me.
Promise me you will never leave me.
She must have been in love with you.
Were any of them married?
Were any of them prettier than I am?
Were they pretty?
Were you in love with any of them?
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
And you, are you in love with any one else?
Yes.
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
I thought I was.  I was confused.
Oh, you must forgive me, General Bonaparte, I'm afraid you will think me incredibly stupid but I know absolutely nothing about this. Eugene is so independent -- he hardly tells me anything any more, and he has so many things in his room, I must confess I wasn't even aware that he had this sword -- you know how boys can be!
Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
Yes, of course.  Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
May I offer you a drink?
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.
No.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
Do you like music?
You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
And, where did you see my portrait?
Oh, then you are...
You alright?
Next time, page me first.
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
It's locked.
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
You did all this for me?
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
What are you doing here?
Better sooner than later.
I just wanted to give you this.
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
Hello, remember me?
I don't know.
My brothers won't give me a ride.
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
Karla.
'Take your car?'
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
Hey, what's going on?
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
You sent my assistant on an errand.
But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you?
All right, I'll do it.
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
Nothing. I broke a lamp.
Don't remind me.
What's he doing here?
Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
Good luck.
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
For not believing you.
I would also like to apologize.
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
Indeed.
I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
What the hell are you saying?
What?
Who did?
You shot her?
How do you know that?
You were very nervous.
I remember you...in the elevator.
Ah.
That's...a comfort to hear.
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
My security people are right next door.
Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
Yes?
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
He lied!
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
And he killed every last one of 'em!
Bluebeard!
Lynch him! Lynch him!
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
A man of the Cloth?
All to pieces!
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
Sshhh! He's in there.
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Walt!
About what!
Say what, Walt Spoon!
How do you mean?
Plan on a longer visit next time.
It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
It's a shame!
Get along with you.
You go set down by the River.
You'll come right out and ask that Man of God!  Mr. Paow-well!  Clear that evil mud out of your soul!
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
What?
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
Pearl dotes on him.
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
Fiddlesticks!
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
What!
How?
Amen.
Ah.
What could have possessed that girl!
Mister Powell!
Amen! Amen!
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
Are we goin' home, John?
That's Daddy!
John, where are we g --
John?
It'll spoil our supper.
I'm hungry, John.
Where are we goin', John?
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
Why?
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
To see Dad?
Where's Mom?
It's all here.
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!
John! Don't!
When Mr. Powell's our Daddy then I can tell him about --
Now can I tell?
John...
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
The Blue Men?
Tell me a story, John.
Why?
Hing, hang, hung.
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
You, Pearl. You swear too.
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
Because John said I mustn't.
No.
Can I have milk too?
Can I have my supper please?
I'm hungry.
John's bad.
All right.
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
That's no secret. I'm five.
What secret shall I tell?
Yes?
Yes?
Mm-hm.
Oh my god, oh my god...
How can you tell?
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
Thank God.
It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
Since the murder. She was fine before that.
Please, Nancy. Trust us.
They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.
I sure as hell hope so.
No, nothing.
Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
My dream.
Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.
The killer.
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
Much better.
Hi.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
Great.
What happens if they don't do that?
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
Yeah.
No.
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
Okay?
It's nothing too hard or anything.  I'm just going to... LOOK for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a... guard. Okay?
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
You believe in anything?
You believe in the Boogey Man?
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?
Not really.
Guess I did.
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
Because he was scary, that's why.
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
Worked like a charm.
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Deal.
And you'll be here to catch him, right?
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him. It's my nightmare he comes to.
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
You know he's dead though, right?
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Dad -- what you doing here?
You don't know he did it.
Just want to talk to him a second.
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
You used me, daddy!
She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. That's why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone.
She dreamed this would happen...
Rod's not a lunatic.
Okay. Hi, dad.
They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
Feeling better?
Just wanted to protect you, Nan. Just wanted to protect you...
Just sleep now, Mom.
Guess I should'n'a done it.
I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
Give me the key, mother.
Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.
All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
Go on...
Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
So he's alive?
Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that.
I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!
Your father the cop. That's a good one.  Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me.
I want to know how, where -- if you don't tell me, I'm going to call daddy.
Dead and gone.
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
S'curity.
What's with the bars?
Nancy!
Screw sleep!
Put that damned thing down!
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
But that's just not reality, Nancy!
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
Go even crazier?
Okay.
Okay... You need anything, just call.
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
You okay?
Nancy?
I must be going nuts...
Right.
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
Yes, Mother. G'night.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
To bed with you, c'mon.
Great
You okay?
Warm milk. Gross.
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now.
Mother, for petesakes.
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
What?
I will.
Get into bed.
I won't.
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
Right home after. See you.
Right home after.
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
Did you sleep?
I could hear you tossing and turning all night, kiddo. You've no business going to school.
School.
Where you think you're going?
Maybe you don't think murder's serious --
It wasn't that serious...
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
No.
What you mean 'all at once'?
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
And then what happened?
The door was locked from your side.
You were screaming like crazy.
Nobody's gonna kill you.
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
We should get her out of here...
I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...
Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.
Nice to have a fire.
Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
He's nuts about you.
From Leon.
It's from Paris.
Bring me forty-five back.
Well, here are fifty francs.
Have you any money?
You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.
Just for the honeymoon.
You want this?
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
What is it, Anna?
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
You feel it, though.
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
And there?
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
Yes.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
What do you wear in the morning?
A dress you wear in the evening.
Evening gown?
An evening gown.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
What was it like?
Well, a hat...
Tell me... what else did you have?
No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else?
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
I see.
When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
You should. I'll show you.
I have nothing to hide.
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
About what?
And you too, Ninotchka.
You should be more careful, Anna.
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet.  That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
An omelet.
What are you serving?
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
Aren't you late?
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Good evening, Anna.
Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?
Guest?
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
But, Comrades...
Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
I must be stern with you.
Don't worry... there will be enough.
Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
Comrade Buljanoff...
You didn't get legal advice?
Which part of the room is mine?
Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
That's all right.
Good morning, Gaston.
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Yes, General Savitzky?
Thank you, Louis.
That's perfect!
Count d'Algout...
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
You mean you are deserting Russia?
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...
Look for yourselves.
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows.  Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
A week?
How much does this cost?
Comrade.
Comrade.
I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. Present me to your colleagues.
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
We will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... We must be patient... Finally we got the spring, didn't we? We got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too.
Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
How are you, you three scoundrels?
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
Will you send me some cigarettes, please?  Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State.  You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. And you three comrades...
I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
I hope so for your sake.  Let us examine the case. What does the lawyer say?
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
What's that?
No, thank you.
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
Au revoir.
Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited?
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
That's two weeks from Thursday...
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
So happy and so tired.
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
Is this the wish of the masses?
They belong to the people.
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
No music.
It's dead.
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob that turns... a little knob... it must be somewhere around here... yes... here... I see...
Radio! What is radio?
I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
Much happier.
Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall.
I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.
Our salute will be a kiss.
...and we won't clench our fist...
And we won't stretch up our arms...
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
Not white, darling.
Are we going to build our little house?
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
No speech?
They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
Comrades! Good people of France!
Don't shush me. I am People! I want to make a speech. I want to overthrow the Duchess!
I must talk to my brothers!
Comrades! Comrades!
Thursday.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
To the loveliest story I ever heard.
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
Go on.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
How do you do?
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman?
Did you make any change in this room?
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
It's nine o'clock.
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
I don't look too foolish?
Yes.
Yes.
No.
I don't think so.
No.
I wish they had never met.
I have never heard one.
Probably not.
On which boat?
Ha! Ha! Now go back.
Then you should go back to your table.
Why?
At what?
Why?
What?
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
What are you after?
This is a place for workmen.
Then how did you get here?
I don't like your following me.
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
Then do it through my lawyer!
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
As a representative of Moscow...
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
Let's forget that we ever met.
I must go.
But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer.
The telephone is ringing.
Thank you.
No, that was restful. Again.
It's false sentimentality.
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
It's twelve o'clock.
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer. After all, I'm alive.
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
I was wounded before Warsaw.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
Don't do it, please.
You repeat yourself.
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
That is correct.
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
You are something we do not have in Russia.
And what do you do for mankind?
And what is your profession?
I will start with you.
I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
Is that customary?
What do we do now?
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
The day will come when you will be free. Go to bed, little father. We want to be alone.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
Is this what you call the "butler"?
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
Then you don't want me to go there.
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
So that is your house?
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
Yes, it is.
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
That's a strange angle.
Go ahead.
Your type will soon be extinct.
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
Suppress it.
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
And where are we?
Why do you need my finger?
How long does it take a man to land?
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
You might hold this for me.
Thank you.
In other words you don't know.
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
At what intervals does he whistle?
How long do we have to wait here?
Yes. Could you give me some information?
You, please.
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you.  May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia.
Hello, Leon darling!
She's gone, Leon.
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
All right, I'll listen.
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
How do you do?
Am I interrupting?
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
Is this your new dress suit?
Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
That bad?  Old or young?
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
You haven't seen her yet?
Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much.  You look so pale... pale but interesting.
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
Shhh!  ...But how can there be a question?... Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All right, I'll let you know!
This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Well... two million readers... I know exactly what they want. Chapter One: "A Childhood behind Golden Bars. Lovely Little Princess Plays with Rasputin's Beard."
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?
Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments!
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
Oh, Leon!
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Those newspaper people?
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me.
Did you win?
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
Hello, Leon!
I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova.
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
Go on.
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
Unfortunately.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!
I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
You leave me no choice.
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
Where are they?
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
Where are they?
Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it.
I told you to go, madame.
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
In that case I can only say good-by.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
I must insist that you leave.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
Madame, if you...
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
I must ask you to leave.
That's all right... I grow on people.
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
We have nothing to discuss.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon, to be exact. I hope you will forgive me. I know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. Don't you recognize me? I am the Duchess Swana.
What?
Good morning.
It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon.
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.
You're absolutely right about the Cossacks. We made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. They had such reliable guns.
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
Why?
What do you want?
I will do my best.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
You want me to go to Constantinople?
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
May I ask what has happened?
No.
Thank you.
May I ask why?
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
Yes.
Yes, it does.
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
The future of the common people.
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
Raw carrots and beets.
This will do.
Where is it?
Where is that?
Where do you eat?
Can you recommend a restaurant?
Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
My jewels?!
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
How do you do, my friend.
There'll be time for that.
It'll be over soon.
No.  They're not yours.  They are you. You should burn them.
And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...
What matters to me is whether you understand it.
Why didn't you?
Thank you?  Dick, sometimes I understand why they hate you.
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
You.  What' you're doing --
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
When?
It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
Congratulations, Dick.
You're a long way from Whittier.
Penny for your thoughts.
But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
You personally?
They're all your enemies?
Then what are you scared of, honey?
No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
Yes, it's been a long time ...
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
I've missed you.
He looked old, didn't he?
Will you ... would you kiss me?
Can I just ask for one thing?
Then I'll be there for you.
And then you'll be happy?
Do you really want this, Dick?
I don't want them to love me.
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
Were you planning to tell me?
They've lost a brother.  You know what that means, Dick.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
You don't have to go.
Dick, you should call Bobby.
Is that the truth?
Are you serious?
We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...
Dick, don't...
That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
No, I'm not!  I'm finished.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
I want a divorce.
Not that.  Us.
It's over, Dick.
No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
You're not a failure, Dick.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
It makes us human ...
I know ...
No.
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
He can take all comers.
He won't neither. He never has.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
Not word one.
No I ain't.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
Well I put it in. That one. You just set there. I'll get tickets and a cart for the bags.
I put it in, Mama.
I got it Mama.
It ain't even three years we been married.
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
Not like that. Not like you say.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
You gave your word?
...You got no cause to hurt me.
...I need to sit down.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
I ain't got the money.
She'll be all right?
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
I can hear it in your voice.
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
What should I do?
Llewelyn?
You are comin back, ain't ya?
Llewelyn?
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Promise?
You can't afford one?
Why all the way to Del Rio?
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
Llewelyn --
What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
So... for how long do we have to...
Well -- how come?
Why would we go to Odessa?
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
What're you goin' to do?
Goin' where?
What're you doin', baby?
Llewelyn.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
Big talk.
I need to know that.
What'd you give for that thing?
Llewelyn!
Did you buy that gun?
...Where'd you get the pistol?
That'll be the day.
What's in the satchel?
Sheriff, I don't...
I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
...I meant your food.
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
They're fine... you miss it?
Oh. How come?
No, I was just... How you doing?
"Banners?"
I don't think I am.
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
...what're you saying?
I'd rather not...
This is really awkward...
I better go check on them.
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
I'm sorry.
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
"Thirty-two?"
Umm, I don't think that...
I am?
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
...I... I know what you are.
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
Umm... yes. Back home.
Yes, ma'am.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
I gotta go.
Do what?
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
What are you talking about?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
Well, you are.
All the time...
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Are you and Larry happy?
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
I gotta go make dinner.
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Yeah, me too.
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
What?
Maroon.  I stole it.
The LeSabre!
What?
Aahhh...  So what color is it?
Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year...
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
It's all right.
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
No... what about your sister?
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
Oh, Betty --
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Did you watch it yet?
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
David, please --
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
Why are you doing this to me?
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
Ad lib?
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.  Was this before Leslie? Before us?...
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
I know. It's up to us.
Of course.
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
You told me that two hours ago.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
Lyla's very nice.
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
Why do they keep calling you George?
I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
You knew Del?!
No, Del.
The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --
But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
We were engaged.
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
I don't know.
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
I came for love...
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
I got you, Del...
Or the vitamins? Or the...?
...like the water purifiers?
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
Sure you don't want any salad?
What was that?
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
So, call me when you --
It's not really a good time, guys...
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
Roy! What are you doing here?
It was Chloe...
Yes.
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
What're you doing here, Roy?
You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
Make sure it's elevated...
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
You made out alright.
Worse.
Like Rome?
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
I'll go to the Hospital.
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
Dr. David Ravell.
What's his real name?
How did you know?
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
No. Loma Vista.
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
Really?
I left my husband two days ago.
No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me.
That's horrible!
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
Sure I loved it! It was great.
Did you love it?
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
Los Angeles, California.
Where you headed, Betty?
I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any.
I'd slap his face.
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
I begged him to let me put that on!
What's the matter here?
...did I win some contest?
She called you 'George,' George.
I married a car salesman.
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
Okay, okay, look, ummm... Let's just talk a little first and you'll feel better, I promise.
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
What?! That you had something to do with it?
Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
Your husband?!
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
I have to leave now.
Where are you going?
...this is your sweater, right?
I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
What are you doing?
Oh, he does that.  It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George.
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
Rosa, so you've met David?
All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
You should have a little faith in people.
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
Rosa...
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Are you sure I can borrow this?
But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
No, almost never.
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
He is real.
Does he know you think he's real?
You still in love?
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Were you with him this whole time?
You never know who you'll see.
Looking for someone?
Umm...
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
What are those for?
...okay.
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
Fine.
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
HE IS REAL!!
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Why'd you help me in the first place?
IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit, will you!
What? Where was he?!
Doctor David Ravell.
Who?
Guess who I saw today.
I was talking about what you could wear!
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
How many men have I talked to?
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
God, that's awful!
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
He has a wife?!
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
The Five?
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street...
The one you were telling me about?
I got this apartment with a guy.
Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
No, that's not, I couldn't...
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
Man, that is love.
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
It's something I had to do. For David.
I came for love. My fiancé is here.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
You don't sound like you're from here.
LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
You're hurting him!!
He has no heartbeat!
What are you doing?
Then do as you're told. Get her back.
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
I SAID FORGET IT!
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
Is there a problem, George?
What the hell's going on?
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
I said I'll think about it.
I'll think about it.
I don't know, George...
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
We know that...
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
Are you sure you want to encourage this?  No, you're right, let's have some fun. So, what did happened next, "Betty"?
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
David Ravell.
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
Mr. Campbell?
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
"A Reason to Love."
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
I counted to three, honey.
That wasn't my doing...
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Uh-huh.
Well, we need that ring.
Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
That's not my ring.
That's not my ring.
That's good, honey.
That's right, honey.
No weddin'.
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
Yes I do!
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Sid, there's no baby.
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
You what?
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
Let's just wait and see what happens.
What other issue is there, Sid?
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
I'm a little late, that's all.
Then, I'll see you around.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
We don't have to talk at all.
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
Vietnam?
Is your brother a flyer?
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?
No! That's not true!
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
God help you, Lynette!
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
Lynette, where's Sid?
I do.
No. I never feel like that.
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
No way... Would you?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
What do you mean?
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
I haven't made up my mind.
You serious about having him over?
He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it.
You hope.
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
He ask you out for next weekend?
Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
How did it go with you guys?
But in what ways?
Everything was different.
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
Yeah... Mmmm...
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
Great.
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
I got my foot on the floor.
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
Come on. Let's go dance.
That was you guys, huh?
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
One more minute.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Well, excuse me for livin'!
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
Maybe not, but it is the truth. And Zack, you didn't kill him either.
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.
Because he's my friend, too.
I'd like to come with you.
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Why'd he do it?
So?
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
Twenty-two years ago.
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
That's okay. I'm used to it.
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
Are those for me?
When I'm good and ready.
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
I've seen all that a hundred times.
What's the matter?
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
Does it still hurt?
God.
Who says I'm not going after what I want? My mother's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory. Every time I see her, I know exactly what I don't want.
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
I don't want you to move.
Want me to get a towel?
It sure was.
Any time, sailor.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
I know who you are and what you want.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
You got no manners and you never tell the truth! You're nothin' special. And if you ask me, you got no chance at all of being an officer!
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
He didn't give you much choice.
I vote for the motel.
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
Not me.
You got a girl?
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
Really?
Seriously.
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Huh?
Oh, that phone call...
You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
No, you can't come in.
What do you want?
Somebody called you?
I don't get it.
Huh?
Yeah?
Don't!
I said open the door.
Open it.
A what?
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
Open the door.
What's to keep them from prying open the door?
No, Edgar Allen.
Ever read any Poe?
Makes me nervous.
I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?
Something's weird.
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
How many more do we have after this?
Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
Okay.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
Where is the Glucogen?
No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.
What if I spazz out?
What if I do?
Not an option.
What if I keep dropping?
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
Huh uh.
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
I'm dizzy and thirsty.
What?
I was trying not to tell you...
Why?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
He WILL.
He --
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
Stop it.
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
He won't even know who it was.
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
Uh uh.
He'll do something.
On it!
Call Dad!
Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
Blue is phones?
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
I saw something, I saw...
What are you doing?
Close it!
No.
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.
Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Do it.
Shhh...
We're never getting out of here.
Come on, come on...
Got him!
"Titanic."
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
Morse code?
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
What, what, what is it?!
I'm here.  I'm here.
YOU HAVE TO!
I am.  I'm here.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
To prove he wasn't chicken.
I don't know, why?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
What am I, a five year old?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
Don't though.
Small space?
Little bit.  Yeah.
Are you freaking out?
Give me a break.
Oh, please.
Get the fuck out of my house!
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Fuck.
Say fuck.
We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house.
No, I told you, they can't.  It's not a possibility.
They're coming in here, aren't they?
"What we want is in that room."
Huh uh.
Chills?
Nope.
Shaky?
Yeah.
Feel okay?
I heard you.
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
What if they get in here?
Wait.
What do we do?
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
What do they want?
Can't hear a thing.
Different phone line, I never hooked it up!
It doesn't work?!
Damn it!
PANIC ROOM!
What?!
That room!
He's going down.
People.  In the house.
What's going on?!
Fuck her too.
Don't.
Fuck him.
0150.
478...
The crowd goes wild.
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
478-0150.
Well, I know that now.
Shoulda got an apartment.
Got us in here, didn't I?
Too many stairs.
He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
Is that right, dad?
Yes--
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
Well...I guess not.
Bite?
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.
I will. Come and kiss me.
Please hurry.
Of course I will.
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
Honey, Church will be fine.
Yaay!
Yes, but the rope might be--
Am I really gonna have my own room?
It's gorgeous!
Do you swear?
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...
Then why do I have to go to bed?
I'm not tired!
Yeah, sure.
I don't get it.
You believe in it.
Do you believe that?
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
No more chocolate chip cookies.
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
I hate that smell.
Because you promised.
Is he really all right?
Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks!
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
To remember.
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
Well, I thought it was safe--
Yayyy!
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
Yaay!
Don't bother. I'm coming home.
Was it Pascow?
Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
Louis, are you sure?
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
I'm going to try to do better.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda.
I heard you tonight.
I got eggs down here!
Thank you, Louis.
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
That's enough of that kind of talk!
Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
She's finally asleep.
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
It's beautiful!
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Gage's gone!
Come on--let's parole 'em.
Louis, the house is beautiful.
Will -- you can't trust him.
The curse drove you to gather this?
It's a pirate medallion.
Then why aren't you eating?
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Can I trust you?
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
Thank you, sir.
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household.
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
I'll drop it!
Very well.
I want you to leave.  And never come back.
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
Then I can wear men's clothing.
What?
Not as a condition -- a request.
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
Commodore, please!
No.  The pirates have taken Will --
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
Commodore, you can't do that!
Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him.
Commodore, I must protest.  Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
I can't breathe.
His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
Boy overboard!
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
About the day we met. Do you remember?
Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
Difficult ... to say.
I knew it.
Ceremony?
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
Yes -- yes.
Yes, father.
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
It doesn't!
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
-- then we never would have met.
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
What's your plan?
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
Exactly.
That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --
Yes, the rum is gone.
To freedom.
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
That was before I met one, of course.
Oh, no ... it's silly.  Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates, really.  They seemed so romantic and daring --
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
Not when you can drink instead, at least.
A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
But ... you did it before!  Last time --
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
Come on!
You're in league with Barbossa!
You?!
You are despicable.
Miss Swann.
What did you use?
What are you going to do to him?
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
Pollution?
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
No, thank you.
You can't mean that.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
No.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.
Make me?  How?  You think he's going to torture me?
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
You're afraid of him.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
Is that what Argon told you?
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel!  Do you understand that?
Opportunity?
I don't believe this is happening...
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
You were never invited to my house.
What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
The replicators?
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?
I'm not sure.  That's the funny thing about him.  He's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it.
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
What?  Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel.  I was just thinking...
Things do change.
Do you suppose that was our problem? We met before our time?  I think that happens a lot.  People, events, planets all just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks into place.
God, what a fight that was.
God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal.  Do you remember that?
Do the words 'hero fantasies' mean anything to you?  How about 'infantile dementia'?
You're not going after Argon!
Daniel, just forget Argon.  Let's get out of here.  We'll find another way to stop the waste.
The same thing I suppose.
Yes.
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
Did you think I could just leave you...?
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
Argon's private lab.
Oh no!  Argon!  We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot!  We have to get the nanobot!
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
You're not going back to jail.  All we need to do is find the nanobot. Once the meltdown is under control, then we deal with Argon --
Oh no.  They're trying to blame you for the accident.  That means they must not have been able to control the replicators.
Who is he?
Did you go?
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
Like a glove.
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
That's pretty good.
I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
Something else I want to try.
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
How far can you stretch?
The nanobot... it's not here...
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
No problem.
Probably the caffeine.
I'm glad you came to me for help.
Just like old times.
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
Victim my ass!  You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
You have no one to blame but yourself.
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
What about it!
What?  What's wrong?
Is something wrong?
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
That's right.
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
Three days ago it was.
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract.  We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.
Mostly caffeine diuretics.  Help you go to the bathroom.
What has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to Calumet City if we don't hurry.
We don't have time for hysterics.
Daniel!
Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
Yes.
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
I don't know.
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
... just like the mouse.
The nanobot.
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
Daniel, give him the Trix.
You're insane.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
We've had this conversation already, Daniel.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
Nothing really worthwhile.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
It was a long time ago, Daniel.  We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
It already is.
I guess I should be flattered.
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
The big house?
Is that so?
Same old Daniel.
Really?  What have you been doing?
When did you...?
Daniel...
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
What in the hell?
Yes, he might be.
Yes, that is what I was thinking.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
Dexter.
You don't seem to understand that this one's different. He has brains.
Exactly.
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
I think I better go, Stew.
Goodbye, Stew
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
Yes - isn't it.
Indeed? How interesting.
You're acting like a child.
That's ridiculous.
You can't walk out of here like this.
Stewart!
Your house?
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
I see.
Good morning. What does this mean?
That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
Are you crazy?
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
What are you talking about?
Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you?
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
No? What do you look upon her as?
Yes - isn't it?
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
Gallagher!
Oh yes you will wear garters
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
I know that.
You wear them of course, silly.
Do you like them?
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
Oh, I love that nose. It's such a sweet nose.
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
You have the cutest nose I've
Of course I am Stewart.
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
Your place?
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
I'm glad.
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
That's because you're too far away, Stew.
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff
Please go. I'll explain to Mother.
Oh, Mother!
Not if you're going to lose any sleep about it.
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
You don't wear garters!
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
Really?
won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and 
I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
For the letters, of course.
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
Will you step into the library?
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
I suppose you're going to print them?
Where did you get those letters?
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
Just a moment. I don't see how that trash could possibly concern me.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
That's considerate of you.
What do you want?
You may go, Smythe.
Certainly. Right over there.
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
Don't mind Mother.
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
Mother!
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher
Why
Oh, hello Mother!
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
I bet.
Yes.
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
Yes.
No.
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
What other girl?
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
What did he want?
Who was that?
Sorry, boss
It'll be ready in a minute.
Yeah?
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
Very good.
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
Here you are.
What could I be?
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
Conrad.
Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
Then how do you expect to write about it?
To Old Madrid.
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
How far have you gotten?
Yes - and I'd love it.
Okay.
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
Hello, Stew.
Yes.
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
My mistake - she's glaring.
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
I dyed one and washed the other.
Nothing.
Say, who's been tying your ties lately? It looks rotten.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
There you are!
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
How is her family going to feel about it?
Sure - I think so, Stew.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
My error.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
Not since you broke into society.
Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
It's the smoke.
I hope you'll be very happy.
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
I didn't run away.
Well!
And the rest of us are truck horses?
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
Of course I haven't got a nose.
Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.
and that
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
You what?
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
The boss is getting hoarse.
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
Well ...  ... Your father would never do anything like that.
What?
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Okay.
Yes.
You sure you want to know this?
Ah.
... Sex.
No. I want to know.
It doesn't matter.
What?
Yeah ...  That--and ...
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
What do you mean?
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
Sure.
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah?
Mary Sue?
Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
Thanks.
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
I love you too.
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
I had to say goodbye.
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
Thank you.
What?
And they won't be able to tell?
Does it look okay?
In my handbag.
I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
Like a drum.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
But I really should get home.
What is that?
No ...
I've got to go ...
Yes she is.
She's crying.
She's crying.
Bud?
Where'd you get this?
I think it looks nice.
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
I'm sorry ...
Hello Bill.
I'm gonna go now.
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
No I'm not sweetie.
I don't want it to go away.
I don't want to put on some make up ...
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
No I'm not.
I told you, George. I'm not going.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
I told you where I was.
Oh, George ...
Oh darling that's wonderful!  I always knew you could do it.
How was your day?
I said, NO!  ... I've read like one book in my whole life and I'll be damned if I let you throw it on that fire ...
Don't! Just let go.
I'm busy.
Oh.  I can't.
So.
What are you doing?
Trust me ...
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
... Why?
Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to.
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
... Lover's Lane.
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
You want to get out of here?
Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
Oh, gosh no.
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Really Biff? The keenest?
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
Um ... It's ...
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
Right here.
Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
I told you. I'm like positive.
What?
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
How come I'm still in black and white?
Can I ask you a question?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
No. She really liked you.
Yeah ...
Sure.
So what is it?
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
Nothing?
What's wrong?
But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther.
Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
Not directly anyhow ...
I had nothing to do with that fire.
Me too. Sounds swell.
Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
Well if I don't who will?
Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
Nothing.
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
So what's the point?
What do you mean?
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
I could like kill a guy with these things.
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
I got lost.  Oh here ... look at this!
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
No way.
Can we do any better?
Those are my friends.
Hunh.
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Who's that?
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
Play along?
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
You know him?
We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color!  Oh God ...
I still don't see why we're doing this.
All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something.
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
Neither do I.
What's going to happen?
Noooooo!
Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty!
What did you do?
What happened?
YOU get lost!
God, David. Just give it to me!
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
Lemme see that.
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
Pleasantville Marathon?
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
What are you doing?
I like calling you David.
You're gonna forget about me.
Where are they?
Can I open it?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
What do we do?
Real rain?
What's going on?
Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you.
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
You want some berries?
Mmmm.  Boy. It's hot up here.
What's that like?
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes.
How?
Out there.
So what's it like?
You don't know?
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
Sure ... Where would we go?
Oh ... Hi.
Keeps going ...
No. I baked them for you.
No. I baked them for you.
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
That was sure swell ...
Oh GOD ...
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
What happened?
Free?
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
Yeah ...
TV repair?
Cool.
So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Hey.
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Tell me why.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
No she didn't; that's a lie.
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
You're so scared.
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
Hey. What are you doing?
Call me later.
Why's it here?
What's all this pudding?
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
You're being weird again, see. Come on. Please don't be weird.
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
Are you gonna do it?
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
It's not cool?
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
Why?
This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
You look nervous.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
You just said very food.
Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
I'm trying to be your friend.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
She's really cute and she's really nice.
So it's ok if I bring her.
That's your fault not mine.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
Why?
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
So you're coming tonight, right?
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
So here we go.
You can't do that.
You left me at the hospital.
What is this?
I'm fine are you ok?
It's ok to ask that.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
Yeah.
I think maybe over a hundred.
For work.....
Where do you have to go?
Yeah.
I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.
...what...?
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.
Yeah.
It's so nice.
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
yeah.
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
About six months ago. Why?
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
Yeah?
Hello?
Thank you.
Ok.
...I don't know what you mean....
What do you mean?
Ok.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
This is Lena.
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
You don't think you'll go --
If you come to Hawaii --
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
...yeah...
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
Oh that's great.
Are you learning how to play it?
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
Did you pick it up from the street?
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
Did something happen; are you alright?
Ok.
What did he want?
What happened?
Is everything ok?
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
So that was your pudding?
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
Yeah, no, I see --
Yeah.
Yeah.
You were talking about the promotion --
Yeah?
Yeah.
No, no. I did.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
About six months.
Yeah.
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
Who is it?
....Hi.....
Ok.
Yeah.
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
Do you want to pick me up?
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
-- well, if you're gonna go --
Really?
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
Oh My God.
What do you do with all this pudding?
It's terrible, no.
No. I'm the exact opposite --
I saw a picture of you.
Business is good, you're busy?
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
Hi.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
There's a piano in the street.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
Do you know them.
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
They're not open yet?
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
You want her to call you Jack?
No one will know your name.
It's ok, take your time.
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
And your Social Security number.
And your name?
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
What do you mean?
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
Hi, is this your first time calling?
Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
Don't puss out.
I'll see you there.
Yeah but I'm serious.
You can't just stay in your house.
Seriously.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
You can't be late though.
Seriously.
I'm serious.
You can't be late.
What time are you gonna be there?
Right now, you're doing nothing?
What are you doing?
Are you going to the party tonight?
What are you doing?
Ok.
I'll just see you when you get back here.
Should I call you later?
I think he's weird, but that's me.
I'm sorry. You're right.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
He did seem a little strange.
You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
It's fine.
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
No.
So...did my brother call you?
Ok.
Just tell him to call me.
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
Ok.
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
Bye, Barry.
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
Are you ready?
Are you coming to eat with us?
You ready?
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
We should be going --
Sorry.
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
It's not bad, it's ok.
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
Yeah.
Are you sure?
I'll go pay for my car.
Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
It's ok. That's alright.
It's fine.
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
He's a writer, not a madman.
Once or twice.
No one's forcing you to listen.
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
You'll hate me now, won't you?
What? What've I done?
Why not?
Mother's not half so blind as you.
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
If I wasn't such a bad woman on the page, Abbe, I'll hazard I couldn't be such a good woman in life.
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
Ow!
It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
Yes, Abbe?
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
I'll be waiting.
I'll pass the word on, then.
Here it is; the last chapter.
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
"Well worth the dig!"
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
"A habituè of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
...yes, I've got that bit...
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
It's only been described to me. In your books.
They've taken your clothes?
I don't believe it!
What have they done to you now?
What's that then?
You demand a lot from your readers, you do.
It's a long story, this one.
Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
Is it terribly erotic?
Is it awfully violent?
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
There's something else I want from you.
I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
Don't start --
And why not? My fortune, siphoned away. My reputation, past repair. I've nothing left to lose.  Silence my husband, or you'll come to know an infamy to rival his own.
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
Once... long ago... in the folly of youth... he made me love him.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
I am eternally in your debt.
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
Oh, but I am!
What thought is that?
It's tainted money, Doctor.
I am not a wealthy woman.
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
Give me back my anonymity, that's all I ask! Let me be invisible again!
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
How was I to know, my darling?
Forgive me, I beg you --
....shame on you, truly...
She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
Don't insult me with your cute press quotes Save it for Louella.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
You're just scared.
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
So you ever gonna do a picture?
Last week would this be?
But I am That's the killer, honey.
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
Uh-huh
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
Sure
I did my best but, well, you know me
And he did.
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
He needs me here.
Sure you can, just--
I can't
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
Mm.
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down.
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
God, these parties are the worst
Houdini mice.
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
I don't want you to--
I just want to understand--
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
You will not walk out on me
But why? Just so you can show it all off -- just so everyone can see what a b-b-big man you are?!
There's a different between want and
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
Then you explain it to me?!
I am not that woman.
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
How much?
How much?
Pops
How bad is it?
Don't
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
Nuts. She only cares about the money. She thinks I'll make you cut her out of the w-w-w-w...  will.
There. That's right.
This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself--
There certainly is I There certainly is! Aw, to hell with you!
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
Thank you-
Yes.
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
Can't you get the money from your friends?
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
But they don't have a case against you.
What are you doing?
All right, just don't make any noise.
The kids are sleeping.
Are you drunk?
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
I'm leaving you Jake.
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
Why don't you just call him?
I don't know.
No, not that.
Why don't you just call him up?
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
Jake --
Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
Nothing is what I said! Go on, kill me.  Kill me.  I'm not afraid of you anymore. I don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. You're a sick animal.
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
Yeah, I sucked his cock.
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.
I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy was there.  Stop it. I just had a drink, that's all. I didn't do anything wrong.
I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
Jake, no --
I am answering...
What're you talking about?
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
"Father of the Bride."
I went to the movies.
I got bored so I went to the movies.
I took the kids to my sister's.
I went out.
What's the matter with you?
Jake...
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
You're hurting my arm.
All I did...
What did I do?
Positive.
I never noticed his face.
What did I say?
Nobody. I love you, remember?
Yeah, what?
Yeah.
What?
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
No, I'm not.
I'm not interested in him.
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
I was just...
But, Jake, I was just...
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...
Oh, Jake.
I like the gym smell.
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
Jake...
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
You said never to touch you before a fight.
Are you sure we should be doing this?
Jake...
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
What does that mean?
Can you see it?
I can't find my ball.
Should I hit it?
It feels real good.
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
You don't talk very much.
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
I just wanted to say hello.
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
Like disposing of their wives?
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
I got twenty or so in my purse. Give me what you've got.
Ten here.
How much do you think you'll need?
What do you need money for?
Unless he's dumber than I think, he won't wait 'til his lease is up.
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
Smart? She'll be arrested!
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
There's probably one in the basement.
Got a shovel?
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
I wonder.
Thank heaven that's over!
You shouldn't have let her do that! If he ever --
There's something buried there.
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
Mrs. Thorwald?
I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
You called the police?
Police?
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
A Federal offense.
In this heat?  They're up now.
What about this morning? Any developments?
But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it.
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
Isn't he a salesman?
He and his wife splitting up?
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Keep your mind off her.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.
Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
Intelligence! Nothing has caused the human race more trouble. Modern marriage!
Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
You're never going to marry?
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
Is what you want something you can discuss?
She's only perfect.
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
That's abnormal.
That's normal.
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
I knew it!
Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
You've got a hormone deficiency.
It crashed, didn't it?
I predicted it.
Well, I only quote from the best.
Shut up. I'm all right.
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
How?
What for?
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
Wasn't that close?
It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
Is he cleaning house?
But you're not?
Do you like it?
I'll rephrase the question.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
I hate funny exit lines.
Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
The same.
Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
I do?
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough.
You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small?
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
I have the whole weekend off.
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
Don't rush me. We have all night.
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
We'll agree they saw a woman -- but she wasn't Mrs. Thorwald. -- That is, yet.
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
Women aren't that unpredictable.
It doesn't make sense to me.
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
I wonder where he's going now?
Someone not his wife?
What about it?
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
All right -- but what's he doing now?
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
125 West Ninth Street.
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
Don't you see how silly you're being?
And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
There's nothing to see.
She could be under sedatives, sleeping.  He's in the room now.
Maybe she died.
A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
What is it you're looking for?
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
Something too frightful to utter.
I wouldn't dare answer that.
Nothing, thank heaven.
Homework. It's more interesting.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Tell me about it.
I have one now.
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
Without any future?
I mean what I said.
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
Three.
Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.
Of course not.
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
It's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people.
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
I think it's enchanting.
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
For yourself -- and me.  I could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow... fashion, portraits --
Yes.
Make the one you want.
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
She looked very cool. She had on a mint green --
Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.
What a day I've had!
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.
Big enough?
What would you think of starting off with dinner at the "21"?
I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
Only because it's expected of her.
Anything else bothering you?
And you love life?
And your stomach?
How's your leg?
Good luck, Buzz.
Feel okay?
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
I'm glad they let you out.
A new disease.
Steady Marlon!
Frank!
Is he there?
Open it.
I still think you should go down.
Are you going down there?
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
Frank?  I'm frightened.
That's right!
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
No!
I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
I was talking to Jim.
Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?
Really, Frank?  When was that?
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
Do I have to spell it out?
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
Why should you be the only one.
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
Good Lord!
And you wanted him to make a list!
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
How!
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
Goodbye, dear.
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
All right, darling.
That's a fine way to behave!
What?
They're killing him!
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
He needed you, maybe.  So do I.
After he tried to shoot you?
We have to go back!
I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
I never felt so clean before.
You smell like baby powder.
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
You don't need to do that.
Are you?
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
Hi.
I don't know.
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
You can't talk underwater!
See, we're very modern.
There's just one thing.  What about--
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
You decide, darling.  Remember our budget.
Oh, Jim!
I feel as if I'm walking under water.
I'm never going back.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
Why did you do that?
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
Why?
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
No.
Neither can I.
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
I'm numb.
No--I was just--maybe--
It doesn't matter to them.
They'll be looking for you.
Goodbye!  See you!
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
The kids take me.
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
Dig the square wardrobe!
You going there?
Won't mother be proud.
Who lives?
Where what was.
"Life is crushing in on me."
Now that's true!
Bully for you.
Hi, Plato!
It's all right.
Plato, where's your father now?
Talk to them!  Heavens!
Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
What's he like?
Is he your friend?
You said you'd call my father.
My mother?
What?
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
I'll never get close to anybody.
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
No.
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
I don't think.  I know.  He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world.  He doesn't like my friends--he--
He hates me.
He hates me.
Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?
Why?
I guess I just don't understand anything.
I was talking to Dad.
I didn't want to stop.
Didn't you forget something?
Good evening.
Daddy--
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
Are you and Mom home tonight?
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
How did you know that?
Gabriel!
Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
To all those cons...
He wants... your "sister"...
No, baby. He wants me.
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
NO!
You promised me!
Gabriel, you promised!
YES!!!
Please, Gabriel, don't...
Don't hurt him...
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
Gabriel!
What are you doing here?!
Gabriel, let him go --
Gabriel, what are you doing!
Gabriel -- !
Thank you.
I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
You said it a million times!
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
What are you talking about?
What?
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Rudy.
Who wouldn't.
You shouldn't have.
You... you... YOU --
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
They all are. Football's on.
No.
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
How are we gonna do this, Nick?
He says he wants it now.
He wants to see your map.
Part of... with them?
Nick, what are you talking about?
I don't know...
What?
I love you, Nick...
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
I saved you because I love you, Nick.  Why'd you save me?
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. You haven't had cranberry buns in two years.
We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
Nick, the ice is --
Nick, what happened --
That guy knows you?
So does it look a lot different?
Nick...
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
They're truck drivers.
What?
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
Not without you.
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
No!
I thought we'd have a few more days.
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
Jack. Jack Bangs.
Gabriel!
Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
I love you!
No, Nick, no --
Nick, please, it's me --
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
He'll kill you.
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
Nick, I love you --
Nick, what are you --
Nick --
Nick, no --
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
Nick...
NICK!
No, lover. I'll see what you can do.
Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
We could live it up and --
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho.
You forget where I work?
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!
You need a COAT!
Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!
Then he shoulda signed his name.
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Yes it was all you --
Not bad. Just regular.  You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
I told you, Nick. Remember?
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
No, c'mon --
No --
What.
No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
You are to me.
Saw me --
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
Radio said.
Yeah.
Radio said negative five.
I haven't got the job yet.
Why?
To the other side of the street.
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
By the way, if you ever go past the Wyatt ranch, have another talk with Elaine.
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.
Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
I won't have you fighting over me.
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
All my clothes --
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it.
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
What does a man usually tell a girl?
Tell me, darling.
You don't mean that Clay.
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
Don't you trust me?
You're not going out to look for them?
Are we leaving?
He knows his alphabet.
Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
But the rest is right.
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking.
You should know. She's in your dream.
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
You could have treated us like they did in Aspen. No. You wouldn't do a thing like that -- it isn't in you to be mean or cruel.
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
I suppose it is.
No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.
We can't stay here!
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
So that was why she tried to run away.
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
They're stragglin'.
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
He's learning his letters.
Like what?
That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
There's a nice boy.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
Where do you keep the can opener?
But you eat, don't you?
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
So am I.
And this is Helen Carter.
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
Our kind of women?
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
You can't leave us here.
They won't be riding in the wagon.
As far as -- Sonora?
And this is Helen Carter.
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
That's right -- you go back to sleep. Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different. Don't you worry about anything -- Mary's going to talk things over with your folks --
Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.
You're sure there's more where this came from?
Then why stay in the hills.
I like it.
You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
The way you act, it must be something pretty secret.
What is it?
That something I shouldn't see?
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
Goodbye and thanks.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
I don't care what he thinks.
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.
That's it then.
I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
Maybe you are. I'm not.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
We might as well start a fire.
Please. Maybe he'll take a good look at you and stop thinking so much about his horses.
What's the use.
Go on. Have another try at him.
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
Maybe I better start working on him.
How many ways can a man say no.
You're not giving up?
What are you waiting for? Do something.
He certainly could. About a month.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
We don't want to go there.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
There's still tomorrow morning.
And we're running out of that.
I tried my best, but these things take time.
Quit worryin' about Elaine.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
Now where's she goin'? --
You think that's all we busted -- You should see...
Maybe in Sonora.
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
I don't know -- I don't know.
Up the trail.
Clay Phillips.
Stop it --
Everybody knows --
If you need me, I'll be --
Goodnight.
Steve --
Thanks, Steve.
For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
Let me do that.
She was only teasin'.
But you're his brother.
You were supposed to be reading words.
And you've got me all figured out?
Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
Well, Steve?
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
Would they be good to eat?
No.
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
That's the end of the line.
No. We're not stayin' --
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
Good night, Steve.
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
Maybe I could start you out.
Would you like to learn them?
Don't you even know your letters?
But he just never troubled to have you get any schooling?
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
Alex, what are you doing?
I think he wants me.
I found a picture of his wife.
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's...
That's always tough. How long were you together?
Are you okay?
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
Hey, I have an idea...
It's coming!
Oh my God! We're dead!
Help!
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Psychology.
Thanks.
Really? That's amazing.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Hot dogs.
What should we get?
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
Then what are we going to do?
Oh.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Listen to me I --
I know, but I've been thinking --
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Feel that?
Can you feel that?
He's here.
What about you, Buddy?
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
Hugh Kane.
Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
It looks like the furnace.
Alright!
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Shhh!
Buddy...
Okay.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Hi Buddy.
Okay. See you later, friend.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
No. I never date outside my race.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
But he'll kill her!
She killed herself a week before he died.
Okay, I get the point.
Thanks, I'll be fine.
What, you think I did this to myself?
I think so.
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
Where's Shorty?
Right behind you.
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
How about these buns?
I am. So just do me a favor and stay away from me.
Oh, right.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
Noooo!!!
This can't be happening?
Both of them?
It was you...
Stop! --
Not in a thousand years.
Stop touching his brain!
Hanson, please.
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
I'm Cindy.
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
Alright, let's take a vote...
I'll go.
What are we gonna do?
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
Just wait, you'll see.
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
No, my friends are right here!
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
Yes, we made it!
Father!
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
Are you?
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
You better go get Dwight and the Professor.
Did you do that?
That was a great idea, Shorty.
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
Am I cool now?
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
Yo! That jacket is tight.
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
Oh.
Huh?
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
You could use the grade, huh?
So, do you think you made it into the class?
Don't touch me!!
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
I think she's starting to suspect something?
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
I wouldn't go that far.
Got a problem with that?
There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
What are you getting at, Professor?
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
I got it!
Got my camera right here.
Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
Professor, what's the history of this house?
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
This is so silly.
But, Chip...
Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
CHIP!!
CHIP! You know how much I hate the brown word!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
Can we watch that scene again? You know, where he rips out her heart?  PLEEEASE?
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies.
You kids. Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
Chip, honey?
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
Oh, honey!
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast.
There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee! He's here every morning for breakfast.
Oohhhhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Ooohhhh!
Oooohhhh.
Oohhhh, Eugene!
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
We can be real quiet...
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
Don't I get a kiss?
I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli...
Chip, your ride is here.
Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
That's nice.
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
...People who don't mind their own business.
Yes, I did.
What a mess.
I know Dottie!
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house.
NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
I certainly did.
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
So you admit you just lied?
Socially... I'll have a beer.
So you do drink?
One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
I certainly was not!
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
No, I don't.
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
I didn't do it!
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
What did you just say?
Are those pussy-willows?
It's not fair!!
Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
COCKSUCKER!
MOTHERFUCKER!!
GODDAMN YOU!
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
Yes, I am... I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson... It's driving me crazy... I've changed my number twice already... Please help me!
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
Who is this?
I beg your pardon?
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
FUCK YOU!
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
You bitch!
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Hello.
You got your wish.
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty.
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
We all have bad nights.
And who may I ask is Carl?
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing...
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
Who wants fruit salad?
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
Who on earth would want to harass poor Dottie Hinkle?
Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Certainly not!
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
He's a good boy.
Bon Appetit!
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
Right here!
Murder, honey.
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
Yes you are.
You forgot something...
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
You could go and open the door.
No.
It's only a little way, Mr. August.
No.
Yes.
Which room is it?
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
Can we go there now?
You think my sister is there?
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
Where?
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
You can?
What is it?
I ought to know.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
Thank you.
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
I guess most people are.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
She's a pretty good sort.
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
Redi's all right.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
But I like teaching school.
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
I'll try there.
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
"The Dante?"
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village -	"The Dante."
I can't understand it at all.
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you - had your picture in her office.
You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone, and you don't know where she is?
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
Hello, Frances.
Why, Mary --
Yes.
She showed me a drawing.
No. She asked about the trademark.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
Nothing.
I did her hair.
No, I'm glad....at least I've heard you say it...
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you - you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister  whom I had lost and have found again....
Yes.
Gregory   you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
Good night.
You'd love that, Jackie. Remember that last summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener.
It will all be over in such a little while, Jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. Drink your coffee.
Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
We've tried so long to find her.
What things? Why?
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table  the one at the feet of Dante.
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
What have you done about Irving August?
Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
What brought you down here, Greg?
Yes.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
I'd like that.
A job?
But you have treated me that way.
He was a kind little man in his way  and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
I saw him on the floor. He was cut -  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him  white  and the men holding him up between them.
But you do believe me?
Thank you.. .goodnight.
But I reel guilty. It doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone.
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
Weren't you afraid?
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging - waiting  I feel as if I'd never known her.
Why?
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
You'll be all right?
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
Please, Jacqueline.
I understand.
I keep telling myself that.
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.
He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
And Gregory -- he loves her.
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said - it fits in with what I saw - she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
It's because of Jacqueline  I can't go on looking for her --
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
I have to go -
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
But it's a small room, Jason.
I can imagine.
Devil worshippers!
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
I'm at sea, Jason.
I don't know.
I don't think that's so revealing.
But you're always at the library.
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
I want you to look for Jacqueline.
And you knew he'd be here.
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
Were you going to make a suggestion?
Would they hurt her?
It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
Cloven hoof?
You know where she is?
Dr. Judd?
This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it  your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
I never thought you did.
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
Is it about Jacqueline?
You're very flippant and perhaps wise, but not wise enough to see the truth, Louis.
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
I was a great dancer...
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
I haven't said anything of the sort.
I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
It seems right to us.
One believes - it's like any other religion...
I don't believe it.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
Why?
I'll be out in a minute.
Yes.
I'm afraid not.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
I didn't know.
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing -with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
Could you let me see that room? If it is hers, there might be something there to help me find my sister.
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
But she was here?
Yes  yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
Of course.
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
What did he say?
Please.
She's very beautiful.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
Because I have something very important to do.
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
It won't hurt.
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell -
We haven't even begun tea yet.
Graham...
I want to touch you.
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
I want to know why you are the way you are!
You're not answering me.
Why are you ashamed?
Come on!!
I don't care.
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
Why not?
Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Like maybe a big part?
But that was part of it?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
But you're planning to be?
You mean you're still in contact with her?
Who? Elizabeth?
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
But I don't understand --
Why not?
I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you?
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
But if you were?
If you were in love with me, would you?
You're really never going to make love again?
Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!
God, I m so mad at him!!
I'm babbling.
Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
Don't you get lonely?
And now you can?
How come?
So you lied to her?
What was the problem?
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
Who was the last person you had sex with?
So you have had sex.
You said you weren't always impotent.
Can't or won't?
Why not?
On tape?
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
Have you fantasized about me?
Yes.
I fantasized about you.
Yes.
I know. Deep down, I know that. It just bothers me, when I have feelings or impulses that she has.
Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!!
Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
No.
I guess not.
Yes, I have. I will.
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
Yes.
Is he going to see this?
You don't know what I'm thinking.
Sometimes. Afterward.
When we're making love?
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Yes.
What will you do when the money runs out?
How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.
Then do it.
What do you have to do to get ready?
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
What difference does it make why I do it?
Don't you want to make one?
Why not?
Why didn't you tell me?
How did you know?
You know?
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
Yes, I do.
This is just... so...
I don't... why... why do you do this?
To you?
And they just answer them?
You just ask them questions?
Like what?
What about sex?
About sex?
What... what are these interviews about?
Why not?
Can we look at one?
All of these are interviews?
You went out with her?
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
Who's Donna?
What kind of personal project?
I can see that. What are they?
What are these?
Somehow I imagined books. I thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time.
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
Are you in the middle of something?
Hi!
So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.
Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
Of course not.
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
So you don't believe in therapy?
Aren't you?
My therapist said that --
What?
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
Does it bother you?
You are?
You're what?
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
Kids? What about them?
Yes! Yes! I think that's very true. Very.
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
Okay. I think... I think sex is overrated. I think people place way too much importance on it. And I think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap. I m not saying women don't want it, I just don't think they want it for the reason men think they do.  I'm getting confused.
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
I feel like they do.
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
Okay, I will!!
Would you mind?
What's the first?
Who's Elizabeth?
Younger.
Mother, father, sister.
Thank you.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
Why'd you drop out?
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Nine years?
How long has it been since you've seen John?
You mean like "time flies"?
Oh, uh-huh.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
...free-lance. You know.
Well... well, the cliché about the security of it, that's really true. We own a house, and I really like that, you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some...
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
You play an instrument?
No, not really.
Well...
No, I think you look... fine.
Oh, uh-huh.
Graham is an unusual name.
No. Why?
Television?
Oh.
Do you have other things?
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
Oh. Well, please sit down.
That was quick.
Yes?
Yes.
I have thought about it, yes.
Not very often.
He does.
Yes.
Yes!
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
I want out of this marriage.
I want out of this marriage.
I know.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
Loud.
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.
You've made your point.
Always the lawyer.
Why don't I believe you?
But I'm not.
Is that supposed to comfort me?
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
Well, are you?
Are you having an affair?
Who'd you have lunch with?
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
I called you Tuesday at 3:30 and they said you weren't in. Do you remember where you were?
John?
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
You did that?
I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
Because all she thinks about are these guys she's after and I just hate her she's such a little slut I thought that in high school and I think that now. Why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what's the big damn deal? I mean, it's okay and everything, but I don't understand when people let it control them, control their lives, why do they do that?
I hate my sister.
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
Yes.
Not really.
Yes.
Yes.
I guess.
What do you mean? I don't understand.
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
I guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything. He's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with. I'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? It's just boring. I don't know, he was just different. And he's really on about truth a lot, being honest, and I like that, I felt comfortable around him.  After he left I had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room.
What do you mean, like physically?
No, he left last week.
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
What visitor?
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
Well, kind of recently, I guess. But not too recently.
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
God, no.
What do you mean?
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.
Yeah, I know.
I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.
Yeah, so?
What do you mean?
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
Bye.
Bye.
Okay.
I get real busy between two and four.
No.
Do you have my work number?
Well. I can't stay.
Thank you.
Thirty-two dollars.
So what's my share of the dress?
Hold on.
I was just trying to --
It does not.
It looks like a tablecloth.
It's a sun dress.
What is it?
Here it is.
Then why do you keep asking about it?
I don't want to discuss it.
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
You are in serious trouble.
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
I feel like I do.
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
You couldn't do it, period.
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
Why?
I can't believe you did that!!
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
You are in trouble.
In front of him, Ann, yes.
You touched him?
No, but I did.
Did he touch you?
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
You don't know that for sure.
He wouldn't do that.
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
I wanted him to see me.
But why did you want to?
Because I wanted to.
Why did you do that?
What!?
Cynthia!
Yes, I did.
Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
Apparently.
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Questions about sex.
What kinds of questions?
He just asked me questions.
I don't know.
Then why'd you call me?
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, what, then?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
No, it's nothing like that.
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
No!
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
Well, why?
Because I never got around to it.
Why not?
No, I didn't.
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
I was thinking maybe I shouldn't be in therapy anymore.
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
Fine.
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
I just thought it might --
Will you stop? Jesus.
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
What's wrong with that?
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
Lose something?
And... do whatever it is you do.
And what?
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
Let me talk to him first.
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
What are you talking about?
But he won't.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
He doesn't have a phone.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
I have a pretty good idea.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
Well, I wonder why.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
I say it because it's descriptive.
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
What?
Do you have to say that?
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like.
Why, so you can go after him?
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
Why?
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
Is he? Strange, I mean?
No, not at all. Actually, I don't think John likes him much anymore. He said he thought Graham had gotten strange.
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
I don't know. He went to school here, then he was in New York for awhile, then Philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around.
So will you, someday.
It was busy.
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
Did you take your clothes off?
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
So make an exception.
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
I can't talk you into it?
No? Not even one more?
I'd like to make another tape.
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
Hi.
He doesn't have to tell me.
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
Prettier than Ann?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do you like the way I look?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
He said that my hand felt good.
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
Very much live.
When I was fourteen.
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
Do I sit or stand?
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
How long will it take?
And you ask questions, right?
How do we start?
Would anybody else see the tape?
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
And that's all?
You just want to ask me questions?
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
About what?
Doing what?
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
She still is.
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
You want me to leave?
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
No, John, things are getting real simple.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
I know. Will you please leave now?
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
Who?
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
How about straightening up the living room?
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
It won't. I trust him.
No.
Hung up.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
Why not?
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
Right.
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
I like the way he dresses.
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
What's so stupid about it?
Look, I'll call you, okay?
I don't think my sister would agree.
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
Hello.
Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
Right now.
I want to see you.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
Not today. I've got other plans.
Hello.
John?
You are scum. I'll be there.
Hello.
Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm looking for. Then I won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.
I'm intrigued.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
Afraid of getting caught?
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
I did.
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
Why?
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
He was a President.
Indulge?
Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
Are you spoken for this evening?
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
Everything's free there.
Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?
Shove it, Ralph!
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
Well, in that case...
No, we're paying for the wine.
You are not.
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
Anything I'd know?
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
Are you a writer too?
Highliner, please.
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Yeah.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
Were you ever going to say anything?
What rehearsal dinner?
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
About two-thirty.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
You too.
I had class.
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
Goodnight, Miles.
Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
Okay. See you around.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
Yeah.
Like what a fraud he was.
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
What about me?
Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
Well...
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Oh. You mean... today?
What's the title?
So what's your novel about?
Yeah, weird. But great.
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
Yeah, same here.
You got kids?
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it.  Right now. Hurry up...
So what gems do you have in your collection?
Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
Hey.
Are you all right?
I'm having the salmon.
I know. I love that.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
Twelve months in oak.
Try it.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
Good for you.
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
Sure.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
See you over there, Miles.
I'm pregnant.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
I guess.
I am.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
So what's happening with your book?
So how're you doing?
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Ken.
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
Where are you?
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Miles?
Hello?
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
She's not in an ambulance Father.
Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
You take care of yourself...  Graham.
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
Is anything missing?
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
Okay.  So he was tall?
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
No Father, they're edgy. On alert. Like they act when they smell a predator around... Peeing on themselves and everything.
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
Second thing this week I can't explain.
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
There are none.
The footprints.
Sorry.
What's that?
It's the strangest thing Father.
I've got a place I can hide her.
He can't hurt me if he's dead.
How about you?
I'm ready for that.
Some people think because they're stronger -- or meaner -- they can push you around. I've seen a lot of that. But it's only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it.
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.
What is it that I can't figure?
Where's the dog now?
You really are a gambler.
That's the good stuff.
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
Here he comes right now.
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
Me too. What's wrong with us?
You like a good saloon?
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
Stella.
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
I run the place. What can I get you?
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money.
I wouldn't worry about that.
That was my plan.
I'm glad we talked.
Okay -- for you.
Simone, I recognize the shirt you're wearing.  I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
My God, are you alright, Simone?
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
How much wine have you had?
-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
You?
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
I want you back too, Viktor.
-- And she was positively glowing at the awards.  I should be going, she'll be here soon --
I just read somewhere --
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
Is Simone back to earth yet?
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
When is she coming over?
Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
I can imagine.
... Simone.
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
It's a crowded summer.  We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get.  Good night, Viktor.
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Really?
She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
You're so good to protect her like this.
Viktor, you should have said something.
-- I don't think that's necessary. I think it's perfectly clear.  I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public...
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will.
-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
That's true.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
Viktor, I have a feeling.  One of my feelings.  There's something about her I don't trust.
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
I'll walk you out.
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
Well, shoot it on the last day.
Even the fall from the plane?
There isn't one.
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
Hair and make-up?
Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
Viktor, it's my studio.
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Why not?
I can't wait to meet her.
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
Why isn't she with you?
Where is she?
Even if you find her, you know the problem with unknowns, Viktor.  If they're good, they get known.  And then you're back to sorting their candy... and worse.  I'm sorry, Viktor.
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
The picture's dead.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
-- Christ, Viktor, look around. What do you think pays for all this?  This is about investment and return.  Those days in New York... that's... it's over.
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
-- It's called a projector.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
The public decides who's on that list.
-- What's wrong with that?
-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Excuse us.
Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
Where are you?
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
Hello?
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Well, I --
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
Thank Simone for the tickets.
Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
I have to talk to her.
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.
He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
Cole, please stop.
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
What?
I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
...I don't know.
They talk to you?
You see ghosts, Cole?
Dead people?
They?
Cole, you're scaring me.
Where is she?
You can see her?
Oh my God.
They did?
Yeah.
Communicate?
I'd give anything to have been there.
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
So who moved it?
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
Did you move the bumble bee pendant?
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
It was Grandma's. It's not for playing.  What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.
Lots of things.
They're right here.
I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
Cheese. It's a kid's place.
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
...He doesn't get invited places.
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
Not lately.
The band.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
...You any good with those?
Hi.
Which street corner?
Someone actually... employs you?
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
Bitch.
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Tramp.
Slut.
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
Carl, what are you doing?
Come on --
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
No shit.
Dammit, Carl!!!!
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
Looks like the alternator.
He's right. You were behind.
Amen.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
You got something against farm people, Keith?
Down boy.
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
The audience!
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
I almost thought for a second...
...no... Mac... p-please...
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
No. Not without you --
Mac... let's get out of here.
No Mac, please... I --
You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
It's you. You and your father.
You're... limping.
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
You never had trouble communicating before.
Mmmm -- so can I...
I don't think so. Keith's about to use the rooster for target practice. Besides... you didn't seem too interested last night.
Getting ready.
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
I bet if he were still alive, he'd like to watch.
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
So?
What's wrong?
What about Jeremiah?
Then why go back now?
About what?
You never told us you grew up on a farm.
Yeah?
What'll we do?
Why bother?
Last night... he tried to get it on with me.
Carl.
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
-- Where have you two been?
Second verse!
Like your guitar break.
Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod?
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Spider.
Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
And this is mine.
You took Bill.
Okay.
Aspirin.
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
That wasn't a good night, no.
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it.
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
How about Brenda?
No. What?
Grant, where'd you go?
I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
Oh, yeah?
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
Just checking out the lights.
Whatcha' doin'?
That's not funny.
Brought you munchies.
Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt.
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Where's the old half--Mexican?
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
Who's the lucky fella?
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
Sure thing, killer.
Meat.
Grant, you're sick!
I loved you. I loved --
Grant, no!
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
I'll get if for you.
Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
It's just one of my students, Grant.
Who's that?
You're pretty.
What are you doing?
I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
Okay.
You're my princess, aren't you?
My present?
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
Welcome home.
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
I never danced in a towel before.
Out.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
Where are you going?
That's disrespectful.
Flip.
Sure you do.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
It's just a work thing.
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
Through a wound on his stomach?
What other stuff?
See ya, Bandit.
What are you thinking?
Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable. But believe it or not, he once looked great in Levis. That's why my mother married him. But like all good things...  I know what you're thinking.
I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
He's just exhausted.
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
Well, thanks for the lift.
One to five?
Why are you stopping?
What are you gonna do when you get home?
What kind of a guy is he?
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
My very words.
He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
Ummm?
Yeah?
You take the front, I'll take the back.
How do you know?
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
Uh-oh.
-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
Like what?
You might have said no. I have trouble handling rejection.
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
Yeah.
I would've come back for you.
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
He's after us again!
Ciao.
Jesus!!!
Enjoy your Kenworth.
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
Eleven.
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
We lost him.
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
You know, you're not a bad driver.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Can I ask you something?
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
What the hell's going on?
You just passed your nemesis.
Guess what?
Seriously?!?
Where you from?
You have a great profile.
Driving, talking to me...
Is this fun?
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Well?...
So tell me about yourself.
Eyes on the road.
An existentialist.
But you could get killed, right?
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
Who'd want to?
Why? You have a bowling date?
Why're you driving so fast?
Kate McConnell.
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
Bandit two, you read me?
How's your twenty?
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
What's he...
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
Who's Fred?
Smokey was on our tail. We had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu...
This is Bandit I. Over.
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
Like a mafucka.
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
Well, if it's any comfort, I's goin' in to there to act a fool baby.  Straight rockin' heat and slayin' niggas --
Got hit twice.
You love her?
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
I DON'T KNOW!
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
...What are they doin' right now...?
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
What?
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
Security's locking down the elevators.
What's wrong?
-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
What'd you say?
Fuck you.
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
What!?
Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?
Fuck that nigga. Let him go woof on some other scrub. We got one another, s'all the love we're ever goin' need.
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I wish they made this more sheer.
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
It's just a little casino inspection, don't trip, he's alone.  Alright, let's set this spinnin'...
A Fed? Like FBI?
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
Wait, I'm getting some fucked up feedback off that earpiece --
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
Why?
What are we talkin' on the split...
We gotta lay something out, strategy- wise. Somethin' tight. Y'go in there ad-libbing, it's y'ass.
What's the time frame?
What else did Padiche say?
And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?
Bulllllshit...
Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
You must have been dreaming.
When?
I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God.  Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it.  It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that.  A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.  And us?  We would have to have "an arrangement".  An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How can I not hate something that does that?
I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
What are you taking?
Am I really her?
I can't --
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
I want to stop taking those pills.
But then I would be dead now.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
You're lying.
What do I have to do to stop it?
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
Chris --
You never said you wanted one.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
Then you'll die.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
I'm disgusting.
Don't call me that.
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive.
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
What's happening to us?
You said he was dead.
What's wrong?
If you're here.
Do you want to stay here?
But that's what happened before.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
You don't want me.
I'm just as human as you.  I see, I hear, I touch, and I feel just like you do.
You're the coward.
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
I love you, too.
Was she right?
Why did she do it?
But we fought.
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
Sartorius.
That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
You don't love me.
I'm glad.
Do I really feel like... I am...?
It was obvious from the way he first looked at me.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
He has a point.
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
What does Snow think you should do?
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
You know, I've decided: I'm just gonna believe what you believe about this whole Solaris thing, it'll make life so much easier; the little wife agreeing with her big, strong husband. You must get such a headache thinking about those Great Big Problems all day.
I like that too.
Good.  Because I want you to know. I really like fucking you.
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
Why did you say those things?
What happened to us, exactly?
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
When I saw you were gone I got scared.
What happened?
As I said, then it's God, right?
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
You still don't believe in God?
Then it's God, right?
Is it intelligent?
Is it a planet?
Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
What do you mean?
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
You talk like an actor.
You go home.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
You want to fuck her?
Better.
I wasn't.
Not a very happy poem.
My Thomas is a little rusty.
Book?
I want you inside me right now.
We're taking a flight?
To calm my anxiety.
What are they?
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
Don't.
I'll go with you.
Yes.
Occasionally.
It's terrific Win.
It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
You didn't like him?
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
Hello, Win.
Say goodbye, Mike.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
I'll miss you, Mike.
I think it's probably still a good idea.
I don't know...
So.
Everyone's all right...?
Mike...?
... Mike.
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
"To"... Forget about you.
Long enough.
... Don't explain.
I know.
I know.
Yeah.
Let's do it.
Do you?
What a memory.
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
I'm going away after that, the next morning.
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
Oh God, that's great!
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
What do you want to do?
You told her?
Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
They called here after you left...
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
Let go!
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
And then what?  I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country!  You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail!  And you knew that all the goddamn time!
You put me life in danger.
I can't open it.
What do you want?
Good night, Mike.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
I'll miss you, Mike...
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
Tell it like it is.
You don't like him, do you?
But "nice".
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
And "is"...?
So it was "love".
Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
So, this could be your last night, huh?
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
You were reading my Renoir.
Didn't do very well, did you?
Urdu and Hindi.
Hmm...
Right.  How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...?
He said he'd kill me.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
Listen, that was my fault.
Yeah.
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
I think I can probably do that on my own.
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
Let's get a drink.
People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.
You can touch me, I won't bite.
Put it on my account, please.
Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.
Would you pick one out, please?
Are you nervous?
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
My father founded a music school there.  The Milton Gregory School.
You live in Manhattan?
What did he say?
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
There's a phone in the car.
Can we go then?
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
Straight ahead.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
Just putting in an appearance then.
Not if you don't want me to.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
And I'm making mine.
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
... I don't want to talk about it...
Tommy...!
Absolutely.
I don't know Tommy.
Sure we are, let's go!
Nothing.
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.
I'm all right.
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
He'll live through it.  They all live through it.  What a world, huh?
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
What's the difference?
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
I watched TV.
I'm not saying it's your fault.
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar!
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
What was that?
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
Did you hear what I said?
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
Mike, take it easy...
What?
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
Coming to bed?
Why?
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
She took you shopping for a tie?
It's not your taste.
Where'd you get the tie?
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
I'd identify him.
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
She's got to identify him.
Honey.  You got him.
What shit, honey?
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
It's twenty bucks in the bank.
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
I can still use a gun.
For how long?
So how'd it go?
Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
My ass is falling.  It is.
My ass if falling.
Mike?
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
Too kinky.
Let me see.
Be nice.
Well, look who's dressing for success.
Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
Flash, get lost.
Hm.  What a lump.
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
What if the world ends tomorrow?
What if you get hurt?
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
Even if they're not clever.
Some things you should say anyway.
He knew.
Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
I don't think he wants me to find him.
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
Why?
Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
Peter?
Her cleverness, that hard edge-- maybe they're the weakest part of her. The strong part is what's underneath.  The part she was protecting.  There's no reason to protect it... I think she's just finding that out now.
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
I know what you mean.  I...
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
Do you mind if I come too?
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
Oh, don't do it on my account--
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
Sit down and stop being such a child.
What's your problem?
Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
Oh. Maybe I should, too--
What are you doing this weekend?
Hurry up, Flash!
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
Some prep school thing.
You should write that one down.
God, Flash can be such a jerk.
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
I hate people with alliterative names.
Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
Uh is a good start.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Peter, you're bleeding.
See?  You big dullard.
Use a fork.
Absolutely no class.
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.
It'll shut itself off.
Yes.  Do you have a date?
Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
Oh, Peter. A zit.
Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
That's the understatement of the year.
I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.
Yes, where would you go?
Why would you want to leave?
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
Wherever he wanted to be.
All of us.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
You're in the Nexus.
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt.
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.
I'll go...
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
... How long?
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
And how many have paid the price for your impatience? How many have died? How much damage have you done... And what is yet to come?
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
Did your collaborator know?
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
Why?
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
I have already made one transmission too many...
That may be difficult...
Logic indicates that is the case.
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
Spock's burial robe.
But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
David --
My readings indicate great instability.
Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
... Or <u>who</u>.
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
Same sector. Metallic mass.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
... Fascinating.
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
Captain, what's happening?!
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
None that I can detect, sir.
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Do you have an explanation?
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
I'll try to remember that, Captain.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
Much is at stake...
. He will remain always as he is.
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
The Genesis planet is gone.
Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
Oh, I believe it.
The Admiral's son.
Only half of you would get there.
Aye, sir --
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Admiral on the bridge!
Understood, sir.
Aye, sir.
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Aye, sir.
Power levels quite low, sir.
All stop, sir.
At what.
That was close --
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
But the damage report -- we were immobilized...
Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...
<u>WHAT</u>?
How?
On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
Admiral?
Stage Two of what?
It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied.
Indeterminate life signs.
Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
On screen...
Reliant's command...
Who?
Energize defense fields.
Yes.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
I failed to resolve the situation.
I did not think so.
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
May I speak, sir?
It is still regulation, Admiral.
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
... No, sir. It has not.
Because... there was no way to win.
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
Any suggestions, Admiral?
We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
Prepare for warp speed.
Course heading, Captain?
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
You lied.
By the book...
Aye, sir.
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
Aye, sir.
Never, sir.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Aye, sir.
He's very human.
He's not what I expected, Sir.
Fire all phasers...!
You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
Why don't I?
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
Yeah.
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
Fine. Just fine.
Just a couple of kooks...
You sure you won't change your mind?
You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
So you were at Berkeley.
I suppose they told you that...?
Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
Why does it have to be goodbye?
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
... What does that mean?
Oh my God, we're too late!
You need me.
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
Kirk. They're gone.
But Kirk...
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
It's true... what you said...
Here... In the park?
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
So. There we are.
Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
I'm all ears.
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
... Who are you?
Wanna try it from the top?
You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?
What's that?
Let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived.  Problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... So that, as they say, is that.  Damn.
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
Where could you take them?
I told you: I'm a sucker for hard luck cases. Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you Admiral.
Thanks. Cheers.
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
... You're very perceptive.
Just lucky, I guess.
Good.  A large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions. And a Michelob.
Do you trust me?
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
Or believe, I'll bet.
Then --
All right. Who are you? and don't jerk me around any more. I want to know how you know that.
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
It means that they will be at risk from whale hunters -- same as the rest of the humpbacks.  What did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the Institute about extinction?
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
Go ahead.
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
You've already been that. C'mon.
LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
I buy that. What about him?
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
Soon... It's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them... This way.
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
I'll be here.
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice.  Would you be his friend Gal'na?  I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
What's the rush?
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
Jak'tahla?
There are caves in those mountains.
For someone so young.
I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
But not you.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.
I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
Deceive us?
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
Why?
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
Yew-cheen chef-faw... emphasis on the 'cheen' and the 'faw'...
... Population three hundred million...
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
I never kissed you with a beard before.
Augh.
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
... I believe you...
You're in quite a mood today.
Why don't you try sitting up?
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
Whatever makes you comfortable...
Come in.  Hi.
No children?
Was I doing something to your neck?
What...?
Why would we be involved with these people?
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
You should feel right at home with them.
What are they interested in...?
"Environmental concerns", again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind...
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
That might not be so bad... at least for you.
You think they're still up there?
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
That'll be interesting.
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
Are you saying they won't help us?
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
At least four hours.
Do it.
Can you configure it?
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
Vulcan?
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...
Isn't it better like this...?
I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
I'm your creator now.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
More lies.
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
What a cold description... for such a beautiful gift.
Do you know what this is, Data?
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you.  Don't stop now.
Why?
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
You're leaving, aren't you?
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
Or...?
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
Friends from Cornell...
We?
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
You're lying.
'Fraid not.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet?
"Money." So you can get dome money...
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
Did you need something?
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
Thank God this plate was already fixed.
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
Soon then.  Ill save the last dance for you.
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant.
That was another time.
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
Is he very much like you were?
He turned out all right.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
You're working late.
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out. Level one medical emergency.  Theres no crying in Starfleet.
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
It'll serve you right.
But how can he? He'll kill you.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
How can you be certain?
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
I don't know.
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
And I you.
I don't believe that, sir. Weve shared many disappointing journeys.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
Do you have a moment, sir?
With pleasure, Captain.
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
No.
You're not here.
You sick bastard!
This isn't real.
No!
I'm only half human.
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
We're only going to be here a few hours...
Credit card.
I'll take that.
You have one with two beds?
How much are your rooms?
Thank you.
Where's that?
What was your last stop?
Where did you stop last?
Where did you stop last?
No!!! No!!!
I won't let anyone hurt you.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
I will.
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
Well...
I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.
Where do you think you're going?
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
Where?
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
How long will it take you to get home?
Yes.
Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
I'd like to...
This is yours...
We can.
What will you say about us?
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass.
The cook again?
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
What for?
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
But...
Yes, they are.
Oh, you're pretty...
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
You don't forget anything, do you?
Good morning.
Nothing.
You're damn right I am.
We'll get a ride in the morning.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
What are you saying?
What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
No one's traveling in this weather.
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
Where did you learn that?
We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
Where are you going?
Come on.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
No. Get in.
Hurry up.
You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
Put that back.
Yes. Sing some more.
That was beautiful.
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
Do you have music up there?
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
I don't know.
Nobody knows.
Yes.
What are you doing?
It's bad.
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
The captain...
Yes.
You did? That's funny. So did we.
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
You thought we were a different planet?!
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
What happened?
It's a kiss...  Goodbye...
Goodbye.
Yes?
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
Well... I'm going to go now.
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
No.
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Not every car, but... a car will stop... Maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen...
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike...  You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
Then don't be smart.
You want this ticket?
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
The driver will...
Say it.
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
No... The closest...
Eh... yes...
Yes.
The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you.
Then let me go. You don't need me.
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
Sun...
How will I do this one?...
When do you have to be here?
Why are you going here? What is here?
You better.
You didn't even see it.
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
Music.
Horses.
What's the matter?
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
You want to try it?
A drink.
Candy.
Yes.
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
Okay.
In your pocket, please...
Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You're worse than a parrot!!
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Shit.
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
My... husband.
I know.
Closed.
Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
Are you from up there? Space?
That's a big help. Where are you from?
Who are you?
I am Jenny Haydn.
Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
You'll see.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
Yes. Very good.
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
This car runs on gas.
No gas.
You're full of tricks, aren't you?
What are you doing?
Minneapolis.
Yes.
Smile.
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
Money.
X...
Pancakes.
Coupons.
Flashlight.
Which way?
Good.
Eh... police.
Dashboard.
Gear shift.
Steering wheel.
Steering wheel...
Ah... no...
What?
Which way do you want to go?
Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever...
Don't... don't do this... please...
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
Help me!!!
Call the police!!
He's kidnapping me!!!
Help me!!
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Sure.
It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
What? No, of course not.
I don't know where he is.
I told you I'm looking for someone.
Slow down, slow down.
You sure this is your car?
I live for the moment.
Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
Fuck you.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
You said you were going to get her out of this.
I made my choice, Lenny.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Leave him alone, Tran.
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
'We might as well make the best of it.'
Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
My God.
Jesus.
You can't just... kill him.
What're you going to do?
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
What a nightmare.
You think Tran killed her?
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
We should talk alone.
Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.
What's going on?
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
Who did it?
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat?  Because they always say "The End." You always know when it's over.  It's over! Now please leave.  I have to go on again in a couple of minutes.
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
Damn right.
Maybe.
He has his uses too.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
You talked to Iris?  When?
You have to go.  I mean it.
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
No, Lenny.
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
Cut it out, Tran.
Make me forget it, baby.
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
Yeah.  See you there.
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
Are we under arrest?
Yeah, right.  Fucked.
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
That's the original.  There are no copies.
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
Uh unh.
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
No, it's not.
You never told me.
No.  It didn't.
I guess.
Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
I'm not going.
Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
Who's Strickland?
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
How long does it last?  Oh.
Why?
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
Well, look at the plus side.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
Tell me.
You sure?
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
Fire's out, isn't it?
This is bad.
It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
Lenny, give them the tape.
Something in your car...
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
What is it?
Where we going?
Whatup Lenny?
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
Sure.
Now you're really getting paranoid.
That's where it gets a little strange.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
So the guy's not a sicko.
Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
But that doesn't add, does it.
It's not your fault.
No more, Lenny.
Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
So that gives you something.
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
And gives it to you.
Are you sure it's real?
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
My God, Lenny.  What is it?
What is it?
What's that?  Present from Faith?
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
Forget her.
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
Sure, Lenny.  The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.
Jesus, Lenny.
Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
No, you're just trying to get off.
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
Get it.
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
Are we having a bad night?
You will not live to see the morning.
What the fuck are you doing?
Fumitsu.
Define love.
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
Driving Mr. Lenny.
Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Sleaze to peddle.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
Well give me some then... I'm starving.
What is that?
Are you going to make me beg?
Just Lenny.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
Take the tape to the cops.
Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
But I mean isn't he Faith's new--
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Please.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
Serial killer killed. In Ft. Myers. Cut up in his van. And this time we got a witness.
We have another one.
Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.
Maybe cause he's smart.
Just an observer.
What happened?
How are we going to find him?
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
I...
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
All the same killer?
It's quite advanced.
What's going on?
You okay?
Tom, you okay?
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
I'd be real careful if I were you.
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
Does one exist?
And you're working with him?
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
What's going on?
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
Suspect Zero.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
Hello?
I just need to go a little slow.
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
And nobody else can do that?
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
Then there's the other issue.
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
Maybe we should back off a bit.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.
Sue Ann Hanson.
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
We did find these, however.
No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
Not yet. Not about this, either.
Just routine stuff.
He's called a couple times.
I've been thinking about this.
It's a no-no.
There are Agency regulations about this.
Because you asked him to, stupid.
No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
Huh?
Don't be too harsh.
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
What's this country coming to?
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
Sex.
And one other thing.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
You got a point there.
This is some serious shit.
"Gone live?"
They're all criminals?
You want to have dinner?
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
Don't even go there. What's up?
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
It explains a lot.
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
A very sexy case.
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
Doesn't fit.
This is a sexy case.
Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?
Not especially.
Five months. I love it.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
None taken.
Thanks for the ride.
I'll be back.
Turn around. Stretch your arms over the seat.
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
Mack must think Zero has a police band.
Sit back.
Kulok.
Mike...
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
Anything?
To do what?
What else?
Like what?
How?
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
I thought I was going to die.
You too?
Well, I left someone very special behind.
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
Why? You're not a real man?
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Yes. Like the quiche.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Hi.
Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
I can call back...
Are you on the other line?
Hi, Mike?
...well, it suits you...
...Which one...?
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
Well, I should be getting...
Hey, at least it's not Goofy.
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
It's not going to well?
I'll have to come see you sometime.
You're a comedian?
Let me get a pen out of my car.  Do you have something to write on?
I'll be around.
Me too.
Well... This is it.
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
Will you give this letter to Michael.
Will you give this to him.
Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I come in to call another one?
What was that?
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
Is it true?
Tell me!
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
Will you?
Connie and Carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy.
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
Your sister wants to ask you something.
Wake me up when you come to bed?
Don't you want dinner first?
Oh Michael.
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
OK.
Please say it.
Tell me you love me.
Can you say it?
I LOVE YOU.
I love you.
How is your father?
Michael...
Michael?
Would you like me better if I were Ingrid Bergman?
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
Hello...this is Long Distance.  I have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr. Michael Corleone.  One moment please.
Michael, what are you doing?
Michael.
What time do they expect us?
What will your father say?
Just you.
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
How do you do.
He's coming over here!
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
Michael, I love you.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Michael...
Al Capone!
You know I love spaghetti.
Yes.  Tell me.
Who is he?
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
They're talking to themselves.
Michael, what are those men doing?
I've never seen anything like it.
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
Oh, it was.
Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
I don't like you.
No, I like him.
Okay, darling.
It's vile.
I'll come down.
Hi Tom.
I don't get it.
What? What?
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
Shut up!
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
Well, we ate everything without you.
You just woke up!
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in danger of turning a little pink.
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
How do you do.
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
Such as?
I just don't believe that!
Where's Mr MacCarron?
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
What are you going to do now, Tom?
I don't believe a single word you've said.
I don't believe you.
Why? When?
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
You've got Dickie's rings.
I found Dickie's rings.
Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
Tom?
Poor man.  We were knocking on that door for ever.  I think I've broken my strap.
Did Dickie's Dad go?
Very.
To the manner born.
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
Tom.
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
Where does Dickie live?
What?
Dickie?
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
Did he kill Freddie?
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
You were going to Venice.
Is he really not here?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Oh my God. Tom.
He hates being confronted.
How long's he staying for?
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
What does that mean?
Ha. Did he say why?
Where's Dickie?
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
I'll go.
Dickie!
Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out --  Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
He's not even aware of it. When you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world. That's why everybody loves him. Other times...
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
Are you okay?
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
Frances?
Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
I never said that!
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
What's going on?
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
How would you know that?
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
I told you! I knew it!
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.
A hotel would've been fine.  We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched.
This is spectacular.
Golly. Who's paying for this?
Is this you?
He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
So you found Peter...
I hope so.
Do you know Tom?
I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
No glasses.
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
So -- are you travelling under R?
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
You're kidding.
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
What?
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
Dickie, my God!
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
Beating you away.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
Okay then, you're crazy.
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Show me the other one again.  I like them both.
I've never admitted that to anyone.
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
Right.
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
Which is?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
Hello.
I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall.
No, it's just -- you are American, aren't you? -- no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating.
What's your secret?
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
Travis?
Thank you, Travis.
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
Hello, Travis.
Keep it.
I'm getting a taxi.
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
My God!
I mean porno movies.
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
I'm leaving.
What's wrong?
But this is a porno movie.
What are you doing?
So you haven't heard this record yet?
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
Kris Kristofferson.
The singer?
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction".
You know what you remind me of?
You must be rich.
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
What hours do you work?
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
The DMZ?
You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
Huh?
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
The moon?
That's really something.
What did you do?
Really?
What kind of people?
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
Where do you live?
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
Thank you, Travis.
Yes?
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
I don't know...
Why?
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
Well, we're all working tonight.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
You want to canvass?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.
What is it? I'm busy.
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
He's Black, OK?
No, why?
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
Oh, are you all right?
This I gotta see.
Try holding the match like this.
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
Have you been noticing anything strange?
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
Alright, now. You want to know why CBS has the highest ratings? You think their news is any different from NBC, ABC? It's all the same news. Same stories. Same order usually. What, you thought they had good news for people, right? You thought that's why people watched CBS? I'll tell you why people watch CBS. Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not the news, not the issues, the man. If Walter Cronkite told people to eat soap, they'd do it. We are selling cars, goddamn it.
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
Just what?
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
Oh, Tom, please.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
What do you mean?
You don't have to.
I sure hate to go alone...
Sure you don't want to come with me?
Do you really think I should go to the commune?
You're not much with girls, are you?
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
How?
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
What should I do? Call the cops?
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
Yeah.
You a narc?
What's so important?
Why?
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
Why not?
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
Who's a killer?
God, you are square.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
Pittsburgh.
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
Well, you want to or not?
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
That's not hard to do.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
I can leave anytime I want.
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
You can do it in my mouth.
Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
Oh, come off it, man.
I musta been stoned.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
You want to make it like this?
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
I don't remember.
No.
Why? Who are you?
That's what you think.
Iris.
I don't like my real name.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
Easy.
It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
A girl needs protection.
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
You looking for some action?
And  I love you, Pete!
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
Did you bring along something to read?
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
You've got everything?
Whatever happens.
I am, too.
Forget about all that.  You want to do the right thing?  Then defend your name.  If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so.  I know the law, and the law's on your side.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
I believe you.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
Hi.
Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.
You mean,  me?
... including me.  Right?
Dad...
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
I think  it's worse  now.
No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "Your  honor, I  object!"
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
Dad?
No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
I see...
What... do you remember?
It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
Your dancing's very good.
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
Oh.  Okay.
Now, did you remember that, or...
Exactly.  And he got good.
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
When did you start smoking?
Well, there's got to be a way...
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
Nine hundred...
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
... and It's just... well, deja vu.
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
I'm  fine.  Really.
Nothing.
Yes.  Hic!
Yeah...
No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman.  And we were on the debate team together.  But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much.  And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
And why not?
After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it.  The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall.  Everyone finally got tired of the fighting.  So they stuck it down here.
Right here.  "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others.  I knew them all.  So did you.  We went to school with most of them.
Through the door.  It comes apart.
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
Be a gentleman.  You have to help me down.
You first.
You must not remember anything. Come on.
Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
You look... different.
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
Do you... remember me?
Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
Look.
Is anyone there?
Then go.
Yes.
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
That's up to you.
Do you think I should go?
It seems so pointless.  I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day.  My luggage.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
And the second?
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
I did.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
I see.
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
She already has a daughter.
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
I don't understand.
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Because she was afraid.
Then why did she object to you?
Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
Then what was it?
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
And what had you done?
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
A trifle.
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
Different?
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
When was this?
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
What do you mean?
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
I suspected as much.
I guess you knew that, anyway.
Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.
How'd you happen to come here?
San Francisco.
Where are you from originally, Annie?
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
I despise it.
How do you like our little hamlet?
I think so.
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
Thank you.
All right.
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt?
If you have some, I'd...
Would you like some brandy?
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
Yes.
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up?
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
Yes?
I was wondering...
Yes, I did.
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
Thank you.
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
Lovebirds.
Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?
I guess that's where everyone meets him.
Yes.
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
Yes.
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
Actually, it's none of my business.
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
No. Just a few hours.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
It's a lovely garden.
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
No, not really.
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
Which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place.  Did you want to see Cathy about something?
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
Cathy?
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
Yes?
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...
Yes?
Miss Hayworth?
Take them.
They're birds!
No!
If your father were here...
Yes, I did.
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Cathy!
No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand.  You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?
He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
I don't know yet.
Darling, of course I do!
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
I know.
I don't think your mother would like that.
Oh, I suppose so.
Your brother told me.
Well, I suppose...
Yes?
It's Alice.
It's Alice, ain't it?
The little Brenner girl.
It's nothing.
How much for the phone calls?
Can I have the boat in about twenty minutes?
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
Thank you.
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
Yes?
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
I need her exact name, you see.
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
Are you sure?
Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
Yes.
The little Brenner girl?
The little girl's name.
Yep?
I wonder if you could tell me...
Okay.
Daniels.
What name?
Thank you.
D'you want me to order one for you?
Of course.
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
Where would I get a boat?
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
It's a surprise, you see.
Mmmm.
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
Mmmm.
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
I see. How do I get down there?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
The two kids?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
That's where the Brenners live.
And the white house?
Yes?
See them two big trees across there?
Yes?
See where I'm pointing?
Where?
Right across the bay there.
Yes, but where?
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Where does he live?
Yep.
Do you know him?
Yep.
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
Try my best.
I wonder if you could help me.
Morning.
Good morning.
I started to say... inside...
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
If they are?
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
But they'll be back.
I mean. I want to...
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
I know you can.  But I'd like to.
Oh, my God, look at her!
Mitch...
I'm sorry, Mitch.
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
What happens when we run out of wood?
Where will we go?
When?
Maybe we ought to leave.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
When do you think they'll come?
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
Tell him about the party.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
Yes?
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
She was selling birds.
In a bird shop.
How long have you known her?
And certainly pretty.
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
Never mind the law. Cathy, you can start serving the soup.
Whose side are you on?
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
Lovebirds, I see.
You did say birds?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Oh. I see.
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
A what?
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
Please.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
And locked it.
Did you close the door?
That's the last of it.
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
I don't mind, really.
I couldn't ask you to.
Would you like me to go for her?
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
And if you don't?
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here.
I wish I could be that way.
Yes.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
No.
Do I sound foolish to you?
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
Cathy. At the school.
What?
Do you think Cathy's all right?
What good will they do?
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
Then he saw.
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
Where's Mitch?
Oh, thank you.
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
No, not exactly.
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
Oh.
Sixty...  Oh.
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
Well, where did he go?
Well, I...
Monday?
That's all right.
Yes.
Can we turn back?
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
No... wait.  Hold me.
Mitch...
I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
You must be exhausted.
What time is it?
When will they stop?
Santa Rosa?
Where are they heading?
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
I keep thinking of Annie.
How long have they been gathering there?
The town looks clear.
Don't let's take any chances.
At Annie's house. She's all right.
Yes. I was just taking her in some tea.
...everything I know.
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
I'm frightened, Mitch.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
After the gulls attacked.
It was like that yesterday.
With my little sparrow leading team.
Mmm?
You have nothing to lose but your feathers.
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
Certainly, of birds.
It's an uprising.
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
I think I should, don't you?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
I'll get it.
No, thank you.
No, I have my things in the car.
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
Yes.
You'll think me very bold, sir.
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that.
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
Yes.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
I do different things on different days.
I have several jobs.
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
Cheers.
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
But not for me.
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
Why?
I don't give a damn what you believe!
I told you what happened in Rome!
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
Yes.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
I wrote the letter.
Yes, I was lying.
No.
No.
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
Yes.
Yes, but...
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
Without any clothes on?
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
Oh. That. Rome.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
Will I be seeing you again?
Oh, yes.
What?
Why did he shoot her?
Famished.
Maybe.
I'm sure.
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
With... with Annie, of course.
Certainly, but...
Yes, but...
I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
Look, Mr. Brenner...
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
Yes.
Oh, no you don't!
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
We... we went to school together. College.
Yes.
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
Why...
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
Ouch!
Only violators and practical jokers.
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
What kind of law?
Do you practice here?
So you're a lawyer.
What's that?
What made it...
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
I think you're a louse.
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
What are you? A policeman?
I didn't break that window!
When?
We never met in court or anyplace else.
How?
I don't know you.
Hey, wait a minute!
But how... how do you know my name?
What did you say?
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
Some of them are.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Doesn't what make me...?
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
No, of course not.
I understand completely, sir.
Well... yes, sir, there are.
Lovebirds, sir?
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
What?
That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie.
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
How soon?
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
Do you have any lovebirds?
Yes, certainly.
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
Have you got a pencil?
I have no idea.
That... that... who was that?
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
There we are!
Well, all right, but...
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
Oh. Oh, well, all right.
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address.
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
Yes.
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
And he'll talk?
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
You said three o'clock.
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
What do you suppose it is?
Hello, Miss Daniels.
Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?
Maybe! Is it impossible?
I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
No one called it a war!
I don't know why.
To...  To kill them.
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
What were the crows after at the school?
These weren't a few birds.
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by.
Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please?  Yes, I'll wait.
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
They're different, Daddy.  Thank you.  I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them.  Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right.  No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope...  I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by.
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
He's not home.
It's a gift to my people -- and I see MacFarlane and Gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and I would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
They did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the Kings Counselor pressed him hard -- how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
I'm cold as ice.
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
Is it a great man whom Gray can order to his bidding? Is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife so that I must play maidservant for the world's sake and his success?
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
You must leave this house.
You've been with Gray again.
You're not going to Gray.
I'll get him.
Crony indeed!
No great lady will ever take my place?
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
Aye --
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
I don't know. I found him lying there.
It's not. I can't take it.
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
My father.
So you're going to kill him?
I don't want to see!
Yes I do, I really do.
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
Yeah, I know.
No! Why are you haunting me?
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
You killed Lauren! You killed her!
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
You killed that cop Dutton.
Daisy. How did you know?
Stay away from me! Dad! Dad!
How do you know?
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
Yeah, no kidding.
I know her friends.
I do. Every day.
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
You killed my daughter.
You mean Alex.
I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
Please. Come inside.
I don't believe you.
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
Sweetheart...
About them. You've got to leave it alone.
About you.
They killed her because she found out.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
Stay away from me! Stay away!
No.
You killed her!
It's not what you think.
You're in with them.
Looks like you have them both on.
I think I dropped an earring.
He said he'd prove it.
It still doesn't mean...
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
What? What is it?
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
What is it?
What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
Are you ok?
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
What were you yelling about?
Watch out!
Erin!
It's not that. Really. It's just... now that he's gone, I think it's time.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
Honey. I just can't.
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
Just hold on to me.
Why are there so many?
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
He gave these to you?
You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.
Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Tell me what?
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.
What do you mean, dear?
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
Of course, dear.
Professor Barnhardt.
I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps there's some mistake.
Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
Did you have a nice day, dear?
Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
I'm not going to marry anybody.
I feel different right now.
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
Is that what you're thinking about?
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
What about him?
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
Is it real?
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
I will be in just a minute.
Hello--
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.
It was a wonderful day.
There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it.
No. That's all finished.
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
But how -- how long--?
You mean he has the power of life and death?
I -- I thought you were--
"Klaatu barada nikto."
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
Where is the meeting going to be?
Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
Where are you going now?
Yes -- Just exactly.
You hold great hope for this meeting.
Why not?
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
Just twelve.
What happened?
What is it you want?
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
Yes--?
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
Oh -- hello--
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
Naturally I think so.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
Jittery is the word.
I don't know how to thank you.
I will, David!
Look.
Leave him alone.
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
Yeah.
For a ride.
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
I told Max eight o'clock.
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
I can't sleep with the closet door open, either.  Not even a crack.  Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared.  I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the <u>closet monster</u>!
When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
I like Michael.
Promise me you'll keep it that way.  You're not like the others, Laddie.  You're like me.  I can still remember, too.
You didn't tell David?
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
Who, Laddie?
This is Michael.
Michael!...
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
Okay?
Grandpa has plans of his own.  Michael, I want you to do this. Everybody has been bending over backwards for you.  You come home late.  You sleep in to the middle of the day -- Sam is always alone. You do exactly what you want... tonight do what I want for a change.
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
Michael, are you still in bed?
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
Oh, no, you won't.
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
He's just a deep sleeper.
For everything.
Still mad at me?
What happened?  Is everybody all right?!
Ohmygod...
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
Not funny, Sam!
What did you say?
Oh, no.  Now what?
Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
In here?
Where's Michael?
Sam!  What happened!?  You had me scared to death.  Are you all right?
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Sam.  Is everything all right?
Lights out, Sam.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Soon.
You've heard this story before?
Not that poor.
Tell them to get something to eat.
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
Guys, I know it hasn't been easy... the divorce and now the move...  but I think you're really going to like living in Santa Carla...
Ocean air!
We're getting close...
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
Max... what are you talking about?
I thought you said they needed discipline?
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
I hope so.
He doesn't walk all over me.
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
I'm really sorry, Max.
Max!  What's wrong?
Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
I hear this is the decade for cute.
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
You're cute, Max.
Hi, Thorn.
Do I look that needy?
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
Lucy.
So do I!
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
Save Laddie first.
Take laddie.
David's looking for me... I have to go.
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
Because I love you...
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
No... no, everything's different now...
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
Okay.
I guess you're new around here.
Michael's great.  I like Michael.
Me, too.
What do you mean?
Star.
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
Okay.  Talk.
Did you want to talk to me?
Are you following me?
Let them.
Alex... people are staring.
Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
Heavens, look at that now!
So it's astronomy now, is it?
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
We took a walk three days ago.
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
Alex, it's just the zoo.
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
Alex...?!
Alex, what is it?
All right...
Let's walk through the park...
All right...
Darling.
Alex, what is it?
Trust me...
Dance with me...
You're late.
A moonstone.
You know, the moment is rather dying here.
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
You're getting warmer.
Admiration?  My my.
All right, what is it now?
... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?
Talk away, Professor.
Well there's something new.
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
You promised me flowers.
Trust me...
Dance with me...
You're late.
It was different then.
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
No!
Kalen...
Please, I beg you.  Take him away from here --
Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
Go back to your own time?
So you can use it now?
It's undamaged?
I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
Is it?
Someone you loved very much.
You lost someone.
You know this?
Alexander...?
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
It must have been safe.
Did you have fires at night?
Learning was important?
You liked it there.
I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done.  I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them... our place in the world.
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
I don't understand.
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
The mud carriers.
Yes.
Thank you.
We share everything.
Every night.
We all have that dream.
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
Good night, then.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
You seem fascinated by the stars.
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
I'm going to sit with Kalen.  Keep the fire burning if you can.
Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
Why would you do that?
Why?
How long ago?
That machine --
Oh, that explains everything.
Then you can speak slowly.
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
You're not from beyond the valley.
He's gone to a better place.
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
Mm.
Is there a lot of illness?
Yes.
How long did you travel?
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
Kalen, look at me.  There's no one here but us.  You see... I'm here, you're here, Alexander's here. There are no Morlocks.  It was just a dream...
No, you're safe --
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
We'll see about that.
What's it like where you come from?
That's quite enough, Kalen.
Kalen...
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
What should they be looking for?
It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
Why?
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Mom, he just fixed our car.
How you doin'?
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
Ok.
Ok, I guess.
I've been ok.
Then, where are you going?
112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you?
What?
Ok. Ssh. Rest.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
To the hospital.
Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you.
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
William, you're not making sense.
It's Sunday.
[Beat] I don't know.
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
What? What are you thinking?
[Beat, lost] No.
They're not here.
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed.
How long do we have?
Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
You think Lorenson kills you?
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
I know.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.
[Beat] You bled to death.
But no one knew until after...
It was banned, you know... and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients...
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
Please...
I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
I looked it up.
His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine...
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
Well, you belong in one.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police.
What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
What for?
What're those?
You're just gonna walk?
Yeah.
But I like it I guess.
Jackie.
Yeah, but I don't know what.
Our car won't start.
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
I still don't either, even after all these years.
I don't understand.
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
How?
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
What are you talking about?
Who told you this?
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
I do believe you...
I'm not gonna let that happen.
What for?
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
You have nothing to fear, William.
Yeah.
You told me this was how it happened.
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
How do you know about Eugene?
William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
And how do you know that?
Why not?
Why don't you help me?
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
What about the world?
The future doesn't look different?
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
Well, what time is it?
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
What do you mean?
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
I was working with a boy named Eugene.
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
My God you look exactly like him.
You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.
So it's helping?
You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
You were convicted of the crime.
You're not crazy.
I guess I'd ask you why.
Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
I'm sorry.
So you never knew your mother?
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
You remember it?
Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
[Beat] Real is overrated.
Well, good for you.
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
[Beat] I do it.
Yup. That's me.
This is pretty good. Considering...
You want a drink?
No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
What's this?
You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
Do you have a motel or something? Money?
Well, how'd you get here?
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
Of course you don't know.
Well, where are you from?
You don't have anywhere to stay?
Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options.
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
Good.
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
Go fuck yourself.
Darryl.
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
You want anything special for dinner?
Hon?
Have a good day at work today.
Hon.
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come out alive?  I don't know. Let us think about that.
No!
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
Hey.
Sure.  Maybe over coffee sometime. I'll buy.
We're both fine.
Yes, sir.  I know.
I've been better.
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
I'm spinning.
Stop.
Oh shit.
Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan!
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
And smooth, boy, you are smooth.
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Tell me.
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
How?
What?
You're a bank robber?
What did ya do?
What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?
J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
Louise, is that you?
This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
A regular outlaw.
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
I don't know.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either.  But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.
Why now, Jimmy?
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
Maybe.
Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!
It's nothin' like that.
Maybe.
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
It's me.
Hello...
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
What?
And what's the mysterious code word?
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
Who did it?
Is that how you answer the phone?
Okay.
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
Tell me now.
Can't it go to any office?
Not yet.
Wire it to the Western Union in Oklahoma City,
Do you love me?
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it.  I need that money.  Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.
Fishing.  Look, Jimmy... I need you to help me.  This is serious.  I'm in trouble and I need you to help me.  Can you do that?
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
I am funny.  I'm real funny.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Am I in trouble?
In the back?
Yes.
Oh yeah.
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
You, too, sweetie, the best.
You're a good friend.
Go?
Go.
What are you talkin' about?
Then let's not get caught.
We're not giving up, Thelma.
Now what?
All this for us?
God!  It looks like the Army!
It's grand!
Isn't it beautiful?!!
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
What in the hell is it?!
Way up ahead!
Where?!
What in the hell is that up there?
What?!
Louise!
How do you stay so positive?
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
You too, sweetie, the best.
You're a good friend.
You're crazy.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
Why?
We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
Oh.
What?!  What d'you think?!
What?!
Shit!
Did you see that guy?!  He was right in the middle of the road!
Shit!
How long do you think that'll take?
About two hundred and fifty miles.
How far are we from Mexico?
Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
Yup.
We've gone insane.
What?
You know what's happened, don't you?
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
Does that mean suck my dick?
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting!
Pass him!
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!
You're drivin'.
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
It would have to be pretty damn good.
It'd have to be pretty good.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
We can live in a hacienda.
We can change our names.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
Wide awake.  I don't remember ever feelin' this awake.  Everything looks different.  You know what I mean.  I know you know what I mean. Everything looks new.  Do you feel like that?  Like you've got something to look forward to?
Good.
Me too.  I feel awake.
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
You awake?
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
No.
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
Eeuww.
He said they're charging us with murder.
I know.  I know what you mean.  I don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
Thelma, that is not an option.
I can understand if you're thinkin' about it.  I mean, in a way, you've got something to go back for.  I mean Jimmy and everything.
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
What do you mean?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
Yes, Thelma?
Louise?
Whatever.
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
I said all that?
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
What?
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
What'd I say again?
You know why.  You already said.
I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police.
Are you alright?
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
Yeah.
Yeah, you want it?
You do?
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
I don't care what the damn pioneers ate.  You just keep that shit away from me, now I mean it.
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.
Just asking.
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
Yes.
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
I believe you.
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
Hit it.
Ready?
Sorry!
Sorry!
Shoot the radio!
What?
I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
I am really sorry about this.
About how fast was I going?
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
Please, God, please don't let us get caught.  Please, please, please...
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
What do we do?  What do you want to do?!
Okay, Louise... It's okay.
I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better drop it right now!  I don't want to talk about it!
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
Suck my dick... Boom!!
Thelma!
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
Now, Thelma, that is not...
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
What?!  What about him?!
Harlan.
What?!
What?  What's not funny, Thelma!
Nothing.  It's not funny.
What?
We should have just ignored him.
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
Just ignore him.
Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.
Well, you got it now.
I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.
Gosh.  It sure is.
This is so beautiful.
Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
I can see that.
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
Like a Chihuahua?
You know those little dogs you see people with?
What little dogs?
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
Before.
You mean now or before?
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
Yeah.
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
I'm not suggestin' that!  I'm not goin' back.  No matter what happens. So don't worry about me.
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
Whaddo we do?
Now what what?
Now what?
I always wanted to see New Mexico.
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
Idaho?
Just past Boise City.
Louise?  Where are we?
You're right.
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
You told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?!
I... I...
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
What.
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
Let's get it over with.
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
Alright, Louise!
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.
No physical evidence.  We can't prove he did it.  We probably can't even prove he touched you by now.
Why not?!
It won't work.
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
What for?
I want you to call Darryl.
Yeah.
Thelma.
They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.
Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?
Litterbug.
Try to.
So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?
Yes!  I believe I am!
You're disturbed.
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
You think you've found your calling?
Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
Lemme see the map.
Holy shit.
Well, I just...
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
What happened?
Drive!  Drive away!
No.
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
You left that guy alone in the room?
Taking a shower.
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.  It got messed up.
What happened to your hair?
Have another drink, Thelma.
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
How do I look?
I won't wait up.
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
You are so sweet to that guy, you really are.  Imagine not wanting to drag him into this.  He is a lucky man.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
So what are you gonna tell him?
I heard that.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
Thelma kinda took to him.
Yup.  That's him goin'.  I love to watch him go.
He's a real piece o' work.  I wish you could meet him.
She thinks he's a pig.
That's puttin' it mildly.
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
He's got a lot to be proud of.
No, Louise.  How come you never said what happened?
Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
He said "Okay, Thelma.  I just wanted to know you were alright.  I hope you're havin' a good time.  You sure deserve one after puttin' up with me all the time.  I love you, honey."
What did Darryl say?
I wish we could've brought him with us.
Louise.
It's probably not a good idea.
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
I don't know.  I won't be.
Will I be?
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
Call him?
Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
But you think he fools around.
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
I think better when I drive.
Did you finish thinking?
Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
You're not touchin' that car.
Give me the keys.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
You could help me try and figure it out!  I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
Actin' like what?!  How am I supposed to act?  'Scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody's head off!
Why are you actin' like this?
What do you mean?
Just what the hell is wrong with you?
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.
I'm cash poor.
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
So this is all my fault, is it.
It means shut up, Thelma.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
We have to think this through.  We have to be smart.  Now is not the time to panic.  If we panic now, we're done for.  Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.  We're still okay.  Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
It means you don't talk to anybody. You don't draw attention to yourself in any way.  Do you understand that?
Yes.
We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
Which part?
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
Louise.  Where are we going?
West.  Left.
Shit!  I... I, which way?
Get the car!
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Get the car.
Oh my God.
Ready when you are.
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some!
Exactly.
Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Well, just relax, will ya.  You're makin' me nervous.
Maybe.
So what if he was?  It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
Yeah!
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Thelma!
Isn't this fun?
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
Then what difference does it make if we stop?  Come on.  I never get to do stuff like this.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
Well, he has never let me go.  He never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun.  All he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing God only knows what.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
'Cause I didn't ask him.
How come he let you go?
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
Whose place is this again?
We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
In case of what?
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it, how hard can it be?  I'll see you later.  Be ready.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
Okay.  I will, too.
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
I'll call you right back.
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
Are you going to apologize or not?
Say you're sorry.
You got that right.
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
We been seein' you all along the way.
Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
Where you goin'?
We're fine!  How are you?
Hi!
Stop it!
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
I'm asking you to leave.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
You sent that?
Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
Sure.
Are you okay?
Warren!
Forget it. It was... fun.
All set.
Turn it up, Magda.
Huh... that's strange.
Come on, what were you going to say?
What?
I guess.
So...
Yeah.
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
A fucking moron.
Have you seen it?
You're a movie buff?
Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
How about -- ?
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't this stuff great?
I know he's around here someplace.
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
We will, but first I have a surprise.
Here you go.  What's that smell?
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.
That sounds like fun.
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
-- He's in a cage?!
No, I mean
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
I beg your pardon?
What's that?
Are you... an architect?
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
How'd you know that?
Don't you want to know my name?
By the way, what's your name?
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
Thanks.
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
You own a home there?
Nepal? Have you been?
No thanks.
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
Ah, she's okay.
I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
No I'm not.
What's that supposed to mean?
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the bathroom.
Where's Puffy?
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Magda!
Puffy, get over here.
Holy shit...
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
An old flame?
Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Why?
I'm buying bananas tonight.
Healy.
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
Bundt cake?
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
That's exactly why I don't watch 'em anymore -- it's bullshit! Why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid?
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
I don't watch the new ones.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
What's a mook?
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
What's he like?
He's no Steve Young.
Good lookin'?
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
So who's the lucky guy?
No time, Magda, my show's starting.
Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this -- some cop's staking out this broad's apartment.
Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep, huh.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
Meaning?
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Have you been up all night again?
Oh Jesus...
You mean he's not a criminal?
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
What...?
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
What's up?
Can I pour you one?
I appreciate you looking out for me.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
Not long at all, but I really like him.  Okay, I know he's a little different, Tucker, but that's what I like about him. He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, too. And that's okay with me.
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
Pat does projects all over the world.
Pat's an architect, too.
Really.
Get over here.
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
Ted...?
You forgot your keys!
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
Go!
Please leave.
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
What did you think, Ted? That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone I could... really go for?
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Get out.
Toy poodle!
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
Why not?
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
I don't know... My friends think I'm too picky. I think I'm just a weirdo magnet. I did come close once -- just last year, in fact. There was this guy he lived in San Francisco.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
So you're a writer?
Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
We've got a lot in common.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
I agree there should be more.
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
Twenty-two.
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Oh great, I ran out.
On your ear, you've got something.
What's that?
Thanks.
Hi, Ted.
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
By the way, how's he doing?
That's weird. I talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times.
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
And did everything -- ?
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
Who's that?
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
Ted, are you okay?
Are you all right?
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Hi, Ted.
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
The prom -- you going?
So who you taking to the prom?
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
Oh, are you on the team?
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
Thanks a lot, Ted.
I live here, remember?
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
Well?
I think I have... I could be wrong. I have been before. Just remember one thing. If you're not Top Gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot... You're gonna have to act like the rest of us. You're gonna have to master humility. For you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all.
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
I know exactly what you mean.
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
We'll say it together. On the count of three...One...two...
Looks like a tie.
Your watch.
And that's one!
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.
That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
That's up to you.
Take something off.
True.
The big one. The one that's most on your mind.
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
Want to play the game?
Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
I like to play "reality".
I sit. I think. I play games.
Everything passes. Immutable law of the Universe.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
You don't believe that.
Of course the line's just imaginary. You can cross it twenty times...nothing really changes.
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
What?
What do you want?
I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
Do what, show you a good time?
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
You knew it. You all do. It's part of it. Maybe the most important part.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
That's what you get flight pay for.
That's not what I hear.
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
This is it, then.
...they say you're alright.
Where'd you get it.
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
Doesn't it ever bother you?
Danger?
I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.
I'm still second best.
In that order?
I'm a professional. You guys are in my line of work.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
I want it understood.
You always get what you want?
And now?
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
Where?
You're totally insane.
It's just as I thought.
Are you really that brave?
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
Winston Churchill.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
Does it bother you?
You ever think about killing another human being?
You don't have to kill it.
You're horrible
No!
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
You're an animal.
Why'd you do that?
Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.
Make what?
I'm starting to sense that now.
Used to what?
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
What about the plane?
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
How about what?
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
Uh hum.
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
Lieutenant...
I can't.
Yes. I'll give you that!
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
There you go with those moves again.
Apology acknowledged.
For what?
And far too aggressive.
You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
No.
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
It never came up.
The what?
Two miles.
If you were directly above him, how did you see him?
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
Where were you?
Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.
It's what?
Where did you see that?
You saw a MiG 21?
Why not?
I beg your pardon.
That's all!
How did you know this was my car?
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
Yeow!
I'm with someone.
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
And on to a bigger one with you?
How so?
That's a big comfort to me.
It isn't?
Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.
Yeah. Hold this. It might be safer.
I'll bet!
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
But maybe you can change all that.
Shut up and drive!
The Last Resort!  Quick!
Doug, don't!
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
I love you.
I'm here at Rekall.
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
It's time you found out.
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
Beats me.  I just work here.
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
Implanted.
It was implanted by the Agency.
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
I'm not your wife.
Doug...
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
Oh God, Doug.
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
You went to those brain butchers?!
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would "spies" want to kill you?
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
What are you doing?
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  Okay?
Well...What do you say?
There's lots nicer places than Mars.
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
And you believe him?
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
Do what?
Yeah, sweetheart?
...You mean it?
Let me go!
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
Tell me!
Nobody?!  What's her name?
Who is she?
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Poor baby.  This is getting to be an obsession.
Is that better?
Then kiss me quick...before you wake up.
What's wrong?
Enough for everybody to breathe?
Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
You sure about this?
Aliens?!
Where's this "reactor" come from?
People are dying, Quaid!!  Stop!!  We've got to get air!!
What reactor?!
Where are you going?!
I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
You two-faced-bastard.
Oh, since when?
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
I used to model for 'em, why?
Jump!
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
I said get out!
Get out!
I'm not falling for it.
I think you better leave.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
Wait, did you say wife?...Are you fuckin' married!!?
This is too weird.
Hauser, you're lost your mind.
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
What are you talking about?
...What?
You couldn't get me a message?  You never wondered what happened to me?
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
I think it's still hungry.
Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
I love you.
Well, yeah!  There's going to be major research up here.  First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up.
You're really leaving, huh?
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
Nope, there!  That's one.
Could we make it to the mountains?
We're not going over there, right?
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
Oh my God.
Well, we can take my truck then.
The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
Well, I was wondering if we could...
I might have an idea...
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
It worked!  There they go!
Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
You guys do all the odd jobs.
Yeah, they're confused.  They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
Why do you all keep asking me?
It does.
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
Ready?
Let's assume that it is.
Yeah.  But I'll tell you, if you ever wanted proof God is a man, this is it.
Darn it!
Yeah, well, I'm getting what I refer to scientifically as "weird vibes."  every sensor I've got is giving me strange readings.  I mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this.
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
Right, geology.  And you have to be Val and Earl.  I've heard all about you.
Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
Eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and --
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
You don't drink "booze".
Right.
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
A number of them are dead, three are in prison, one's a waiter... Two -- you'll enjoy this -- two are actually members of the Chamber of Commerce.
Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
I was never politically correct enough for Comrade Dowd.
I'm kicking myself, Eddie... Right out of here.
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
Eddie, I'm not working on this case. You boys have fun.
You're doing a murder case?
No -- leave him be. It's better for everyone.
It's okay. It was always like that.
But they've still got Laura Gordon -- and she was the closest, about 20 feet from the killer.
You getting this?
So what'd this guy do? Snitch off a dealer?
My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes. One's in Butte, Montana. Other's at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric.
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
No.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
NO! GOD, NO...
Go away. I am not talking to you.
No... No, go away.
Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.
Bobby...
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
What was?
You killed Mike.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
Here he comes.
Don't be late.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
I'm nearly out.
Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
Get lost Bobby.
I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
Cause I like it.
Why do you do it, Laura?
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
But I love you, Laura.
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
I can't help you there.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
WE got it back, that's all.
How did the car get back here?
What can I tell you?
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
No.
You're not mad at me?
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
Laura, I am your friend.
No, you should forget about last night.
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
Not you, Donna, not you.
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
Jacques, help me get her home. NOW!
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
Nothing.
What are you doing?
Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
Dancing.
You mean Fred and Ginger?
Where are the Cookies?
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
Come on, Laura. I'm your best friend.
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
Where are you going?
No, you're the muffin.
Goodbye, Muffin.
Donna, you are a muffin.
You want a muffin?
If I can smoke it.
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
No, I want to smoke.
Do you want to talk?
You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
What is it Laura? What's wrong?
Of course...
Donna, are you my best friend?
Laura?
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Call me.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Maybe I better start our homework.
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. He's a goon.  James is the one.  He loves you with that "lasting love"... "true love".
Well, why not?
Oh god, Laura.
Maybe.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Are you going to see James tonight?
I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
I don't know what to do.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
He probably wanted to drive over.
The usual, 9:15.
When?
James called me last night looking for you.
Thanks.
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
Noooo...
You didn't do your homework?
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
Oh, yes... yes...
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
Bob is real. He's been "having" me since I was 12.
The pages are gone. That's real.
Bob.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
I already made you two tapes.
I'm not.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
Let's go all the way.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
What? She asked about my father?
I am The Muffin.
Hey, Jacques...
Right. Open your eyes, James. You don't know me. Even Donna doesn't know me. Your Laura disappeared... It's just me now.
You want to see...
Bobby killed a guy.
When he finds out.
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
You mean the ones you pity.
"Oh, Laura..."
Everything, but everything.
You know it and I know it.
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
I can't tonight.
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
Not now.
James...
How can I be together if I'm not together?
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
Okay.
James...
Good night, Mom.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Where's Dad?
I hate asparagus.
Mom, take it easy.
Mom... what are you wearing?
I'm sorry, Mom.
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
What were you doing in my room?
What?
I forgot my books at school.
Can I take the car?
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
Stay away from me.
I was down the street.
Oh, I thought I saw you.
Did you come home during the day last week?
Dad?
Are you sure you're okay?
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
No.
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
A friend from school.
Dad...
Not really.
...school's fine...
Fine.
But my name isn't Leland Palmer.
Dad.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
I thought I would need it.
Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
That's not my handwriting.
I do. Yes.
They lied.
I...
I... yes.
I...
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
I wouldn't do it.
It's a crime.
Yes.
I did.
Yes.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Yes.
Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes...
I used to be a nurse.
Mrs. Simmonds.
Who told you that?
Thank you.
How old is he?
You live in the neighborhood?
Hi.
I have to talk to you.
What are you going to do?
Is it over?
Yes.  We've all got to let go.
You're pressuring yourself...
Joe...  Joe...
What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure.
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
Not if you don't grow up...
Maybe I'll tell you later.
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it?  I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
Well, then what are you doing here?
And it's over...?
You're talking like a drunk.
Isn't there something you...
Yes.
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
Why don't you get some rest?
Do you want me to go...?
...and is that serious?
What happened...?
Is this a bad time.
Would you like me to leave...?  Is this a bad time -- ?
And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
Maybe what?
And are they going to get it?
I think I will.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
Laura.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Yes. It was, actually.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
And what are you? A cop?
The TV didn't work.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Still looking.
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
What does it mean?  I... I mean we, you have other tactics...
We just can't do it anymore.  This is our chance to get away.
He saw her at the Northern Care...
...But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson... and they called him up and said to come out. He's a good man. He's only trying to do what's right.
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
...You saw her?
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
It's locked.
Me, too.
Huh.
The Big Boy did...?
Yes.
Should I?
How'm I doing so far?
Don't let's lose each other.
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
I wonder if they're going through this too...?
How'd you guess?
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
They've blocked it!
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
It was...  ...one of them!
Hours.  I've been so scared...!
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
Don't you live at home?
Where are we?
Is that... machine...?
I never noticed before - that's a cowboy tie....
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
Can you handle one of these?
Would you like some coffee, General?
You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
How does it happen cars are running?
They've all stopped at the same time.
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
What's he like?
How can you say that when you don't know him!
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
It hit sideways and skidded in.
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
Did you see it come down?
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
They don't do much of anything...!
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
It was nearer than that.
Like weird calls, by any chance?
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
Yes, but...
What?
And I...I've got other things happening.
So I don't know about horror.
I don't know, Bob.  I'm flattered and all, but I've got a kid, now.
You mean that was a...
Can I read it?
The nightmares.
Which means he's having nightmares again?
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
Don't speed, Chase.  It's not...
Yes.
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
Like Freddy.
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
He's had some sort of...episode.
Chase, it's Dylan!
Chase, you'd better come home.
Chase. Hi...
Guess so.
Just be careful, okay?
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
What if it isn't over?
No, you don't.
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
More or less.  Dylan, time to get dressed.  I'm late.
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
One of mom's cups got broken.
No biggie, really.
Chase...
He sleepwalks, you idiot!  He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.  Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
You don't understand.  If Dylan falls asleep,then...
I want my kid out of here now!
DO you mind...
Everything is not fine!
He was just here!
Doctor...
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
Oh my God...
Is he all right?
Like what?
Does he have to stay here over night?
No...
No.
No.
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
What...what is that?
Dylan, where's the man?
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
Promise.  Cross my heart.  But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
That's right.  So I won't be long. Meanwhile Julie's gonna be right here with you.
Tell you what.  I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now.  You know home isn't far from here, right?
I know he is, sweetie.  We'll both go get Rex right now.
You okay, champ?
Home, that's right.
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
And...what's the man doing?
Your bed?
You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
Mommy's fine, Dylan.  Just had a bad dream.  What're you doing out of bed?
Right.
He's on his way.
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
Who?
They were safe and could sleep.
Tomorrow night.
Time for sleep.
This is going to give you nightmares.
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
Rex?  Who's Rex?
Dylan, I gotta go.  Forgive me?
What?
Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.
You have a fever, sweetie?
When do you think it'll be done?
Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
Yeah...how'd you know?
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
In what, a romantic comedy?
I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
I'm fine.
Fred Krueger did it.
I know how Chase really died.
Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
You really think Dylan's okay?
Really?
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
Freddy, for all I know.
I've never mentioned it to him.
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
What...happened?
I want to see for myself.
I want to see the body.
Yes.
Yes?
I just can't.
I'm sorry, I can't.
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
Choice?  What kind of choice?
You know damn well it's more than that now!  How can we stop him?
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
That was Nancy, not me!
Me?  Why me?
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
Then what is he doing?
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
Like the Genie in the bottle.
Captured?  How?
Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
What's that?
Robert?  I...
Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.
My child?  No...but...
No, not really.  I...
I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
Black's fine.
Coffee'd be nice.
Now?
Uh...sure...when?
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Yes?
Real soon... I'll be makin' the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
Why? He's right in the groove.
Fuck me.
No way... GET OUT!!!
Get out.
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
Well... Yeah - okay.
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
Twenty.
What's Cao Ben?
You won't of missed much.
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
This 'bout the fifth time?
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
What is it, Johnnie?
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindu's lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin' down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin' dope up her arms.
Maybe I was there, but I didn't see anythin'. All I know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby!
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.
Don't talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut. I know what volition means, and that's why I want Sailor Ripley off the planet! He's pure slime and it's leakin' all over my baby. Maybe you could push him into makin' some kinda move and then kill him dead. You'd only be defendin' yourself, and with his record, nobody'd fuss.
I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there'd be trouble. He's just got some kind of influence over her I can't decipher. There's somethin' wild in Lula I don't know where it comes from. You gotta find 'em, Johnnie.
Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.
Why, honey?
Thinkin' a second, baby.
Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
And?
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight?
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.
Don't give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain't the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.
SAILOR!!!!
How can you say that, Sailor?
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
Shake hands with your daddy.
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
He's the kind liked it.
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.
I mean tomorrow.
Let's leave here.
Sail?
So where'd you say you was?
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
You been drinkin', huh?
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it.
Sailor? You know what?
No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.
Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.
Come sit by me.
A little, I think... Darlin'?
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
You find any work?
That you, Sail, honey?
I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired.
This ain't exactly my most thrillin' notion of startin' a new life.
Sailor?
Now what?
And no AC.
No radio or TV...
Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?
I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
You think she's gonna make it?
Sailor, what are we gonna do?
SAILOR!!!
Oh God, Sailor.
What's that?
I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
If you say so.
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin'... I saw mama up in her room with Santos...
No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...
Yeah, I'm here.
How'd you know my daddy?
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
Oh shit...
You knew my daddy?
You're scarin' me, baby.
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
How much we got left, honey?
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
You think she's pretty?
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
We'll find out in a hurry.
Maybe there's a place we could hear some music. I feel like dancin'. We could ask someone.
I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
You think he saw us?
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
Who do?
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
What was this one?
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
You certain?
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.
It's just another case, Sailor.
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
Honey, we're goin' to bed now and it's time to change the subject.
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
Say what? Honestly, sugar, you can talk more shit sometimes?
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
What's that, honey?
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
Got anyplace special in mind?
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
What kinda trash talk is that?
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
We got through two states already.
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
You mean like pedal pushers?
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
What'd you say to her?
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
You still got plenty energy for me, baby.
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
Sailor!
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
Yeah, I suppose. But you know somethin' baby, hair does make a difference.
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
It ain't so funny now, though. December before Christmas? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him. He was missin' for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin' dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit.
...are followin' him around.
One time - real late - like about two thirty a.m.? She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin' sandwiches in the kitchen.
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
Dell disappeared. Dell was learnin' a hard lesson. What I learned from observin' Dell is I think people who are frightened want to disappear. He'd startin' behavin' weird? Like comin' up to people every fifteen minutes and askin' how they were doin'?
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
...I hope you appreciate my spendin' six hundred dollars, not countin' what it cost us to get here and back... This man's the best damn abortionist in the South.
She got me an abortion...
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
Sailor?
That don't seem fair.
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
What's that honey?
What you have to get personal about so quick? All I mean is you could possibly read a book.
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.
I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin'. Seems to me the government could do somethin' about it. One of these mornings the sun'll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray.
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
No, he picked me up.
Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.
Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin' her hair dyed? And I was alone in the house.
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
What brand'd she smoke?
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
Hey baby...
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
Damn!
I'll bet.
Mama... if you get in the way of me and Sailor's happiness, I'll fuckin' pull your arms out by the roots.
What if I told you not to?
Wouldn't make any difference.
What if I asked you not to?
Really, mama, I gotta go.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Got any plans?
Six.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Course I am, mama.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
Mama, Sailor's in deep trouble here. I just can't leave him.
You're comin' home, precious. Santos' gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
I ain't that dumb, mama. Sailor and I been on a crime spree? Knockin' off convenience stores all across the south? Ain't you read about it?
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Just a place.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
Like hell.
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
Mama???
And jus when my baby's out on some Texas road with a killer.
Oh God! What does that mean?
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
Please Santos... Where's Johnnie?
Where we goin'?
Santos... What's happenin' here?
Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?
No...
Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
Someone's gonna see us.
What?
You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
Santos... I can't...
No... But...
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
See! I knew you had it all under control.
Yes.
Yes.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
Yes.
In the head.
No.
Yes.
Shoot him.
Santos...
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
That's your business... I don't care how.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
Yes... Get rid of him.
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
Yes.
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
Santos... It isn't.
That's not why I called.
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...
Well, she wants to fuck you.
Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?...
...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again.
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.
No, it's not that, it's...
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
It beats 'What's your major?'
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
Who does?
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
I don't know -- maybe -- I don't think so.
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
Grady!
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside.
James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...  Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
I just mean, I -- I guess Emily isn't going to be there when you get home.
So what are you going to do?
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
James'll know about George Sanders.
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
Just checking.
I think so... What about you?
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
I know, but sometimes...
Did you just make that up?
It didn't come up.
I told Walter.
Some times...
Oh?
Dozens. It's very sad.
And you're old.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
I said it didn't sound like you.
He told me.
And what do you think you might have said?
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
Are you sure you parked it there?
Grady.
And the jacket?
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
What's he doing out there?
Who's that sitting in your car?
That... and you.
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
All right.
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
I'm kidding. Hello?
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
Did you confess?
You heard? How?
Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too.
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
I love you, Grady.
Pow.
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
Who's gun is that?
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
Neither do I.
And? Are you going to tell him?
Has he asked to see the book yet?
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
Is that Cristaile?
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
She's left before...
I think Walter would find this a little more than surprising.
I'm sure.
I'm pregnant.
You go first.
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
I got the message you called.
Professor Tripp.
I haven't heard of half of those.
Just a few then. The big ones.
Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
Are you riding with me, James?
You want to keep him happy.
I doubt it, darling.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
Robin.
What does that mean?
I'm not pretty.
I have friends.
It's my bird book.
See anything interesting?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
I have to go.
Were you watching me?
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
You should hear the bird.
Something like that.
It's a bright sound.
I can't.
It's hard to describe.
Their sound is quite musical.
You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
I don't like starlings.
They're starlings.
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
There's a million birds here.
What are you looking at?
If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
Have you seen Walter?
Well, Mary, you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don't you?
Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
Why's that?
What?
Will I see you again?
Can't I stay a little longer?
I don't mind.
Do you still want me to sit on your lap?
Walter?
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
How do you know?
But will he... ?
What will happen if I do?
I can't.
Ms. Kramer.
Yes.
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.
They sound like finches.
Do you want me to sit on your lap?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
No thank you.
What?
Yes?
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
It sounds like you were banished.
How come?
Do you have many friends?
I will be in three months.  I can't wait. I hate being eleven. It has to be the stupidest age in the world.
I'm twelve.
Yeah, like the bird.
Not when they fly.
Fucking liar.
You okay?
Do you want to talk about it?
What's going on?
What's your fucking problem?
Do what?
Prove it.
Don't be scared, Walter.
You're such an asshole.
Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.
What's it look like?
Fine.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
Who doesn't?
Just think about it.
I think it's a fucking good idea.
Move in with me.
We should live together.
Neither am I.
You're scared.
What?
Not ever.
Are you serious?
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
I love my brothers.
All three -- in chronological order.
I got poked around... here and there.
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
What odds?
I know.
What?
Bullshit.
And what do you tell yourself now?
You really believe that?
They seduce you?
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...
Why young girls, Walter?
My father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave.
My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.
I'm sorry, Walter.
You mean the time you're locked away?
Yes! I want to know.
What was prison like?
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?
Walter.
Hey, I'm not --
What?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
Twelve years in prison?
How young?
What did you do to them?
How many girls did you molest?
You're not joking.
Molested little girls?
So, what did you do?
The worst?
Because I like you.
Hey, there.
I sleep like a dead horse. Anything else?
Is that all?
Did I say something wrong?
Well, Walter, this is going to sound off-the-wall, but I like to sleep with a man after we fuck.
I thought I'd stay the night.
How about in the morning.
Tell me about it.
Since you've had sex?
Do you?
What's the problem?
No you're not.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
Hey, that was... intense.
Not tonight.
Are you going to tell me your deep dark secret before we have sex?
So?
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
So... what's your dark secret?
I'm not easily shocked.
Something happened to you.
You're damaged.
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
Yeah, they could.
What about them?
I go backpacking a lot. Lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two.
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
Doesn't it get noisy?
Is that a school?
You plan to drink both those beers?
You should buy several. I've got shitty light in my place, but my plants don't seem to mind. Light's important, but it's not everything.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
Southern light.
What do you think?
You never spoke to me before.
They're all assholes.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
You're quiet at work.
Guess I'm not like most women.
What's weird about that?
Very weird.
Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?
Yeah, you.
I'm talking about you.
There's something wrong with this picture.
It's fucking freezing out here.
Want a ride?
Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.
What?
Hello, Brigman.
No, Bud, no... not you.
I've been better.  Next time it's your turn, okay?
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
Tell me later.
It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
We've only got one suit.
How?
Calm down, Bud.
I don't know, look around.
You see where it's coming in?
They'll come out after us.
Well, that's that.
Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--
You noticed.
Yeah.  So sue me.
Not in this thing.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
You owe me one, Virgil.
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
Now what?
They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control.
It's trying to communicate.
He's got the shakes?
You dumb jarhead motherf--
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
Bud, something really important is happening here.
I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something down there.  Something not... us.
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
Cute, Virgil.
I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!
But what did he see that made him panic?
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
No.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple. Aren't you clever?  You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name is Michael.
I haven't worn mine in months.
What are you still wearing that for?
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
That must be it.
Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
Not for long.
Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up to fight.  You--
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
I can't believe you let them do this!
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
You better not say you missed that.
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
How many are there?
Copy that.
Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS...
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
Let's go for it.  We could get lucky.
Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
A non-terrestrial intelligence.
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
What's you depth, Cab Three?
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
Would we see the flash?
What kind of light?
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.
8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
This one is gorgeous.
I didn't know one could sleep so well on a yacht. It lulls you ...
Did you sleep well?
What! After giving us such a run around...
If I had a man waiting for me for half an hour and whom I hadn't seen for a month ...
But where are you going?
Maybe you'd better ask him.
Somebody must live here!
There's no comparison.
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
How wonderful!
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
Well, what?
At what?
Sounds like the name of a fish -- merluzzo, basiluzzo...
What is that one over there called?
I deserve it.
Tell me once more.
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
Late, very late.
I'm too sleepy.
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
Oh, Sandro... I want everything you do. But...
What are you saying?
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
No reason why...
No, Sandro... Please...
Sandro ...What's the matter?
Okay. In a few minutes.
So, you wonder why?
And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...
Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...
But why am I so infatuated with you?
So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
What! Get married?
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
And why did you drop them?
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love you," I would believe you...
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
Don't think that I want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. Please, Sandro, do try to understand me... It would look like I was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable...
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
Any news?
Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
Oh, Sandro...
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
Yes, you should go.
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
Yes.
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening.
Occasionally, but always with affection.
Yes, very much so.
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.
But why don't you tell him?  A girl who was with us has disappeared.
And how do you explain that?
I... I don't know... I didn't think it was worthwhile... She was laughing over it...
As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.
Find anything?
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
There's nothing much to laugh at.
How should I be ... arrogant?
That seems to apply to you also...
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get back into bed.
But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
Would you please see if Sandro is with him? He's not in his room. I'm sorry to disturb you.
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
It means being without money.
What do you mean by sensible?
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
But then why did you bother changing?
I'm not coming.
No.
Do you consider that a compliment?
You say that just to flatter me.
It's divine!
It was futile. We went all over.
But where did you finally end up?
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
To do what?
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
Have you ever been in love?
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
Better dead.
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
It couldn't be any clearer.
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
But for what reason should I come there?
To the shark.
Yes, yes, of course.
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
Ettore...
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you?
Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
Oh, no, not at all. And then you know very well that he'll forgive you anything; just as long as you admit to him that you're a worse driver than he is...
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Did you manage to find good rooms?
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
I don't see why I should mind.
But you have to  consider all possibilities, Sandro.
Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...
Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you getting so impatient?
You know, I don't love anybody.
Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
Why have we stopped?
That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets.
I don't know... I don't know...
For what?
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
Should you see a doctor?
It's not my time of month.
What do you mean?
It's not that... it's not that...
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
Say it!
Yes, Mother.
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
They were stained.
Why?
I burnt them.
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
No.
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
It made them holy.
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
Why?
Yes Mother.
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
Dear Jesus...
I don't know.
Why?
I'm being punished.
Yes, of God.
Of God.
My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
No I don't... the host is enough.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
I'm not hungry.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
But she watches... she listens.
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
Who?
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
Oh my dear child.
No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
That's not what he meant.
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
Who tells you these things?
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
Agnes...
Look at the statues, they're thin.
Why?
It's a sin to be fat.
Who told you this?
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
He loves you the way you are.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
Because...
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
I'm a blimp.
Agnes...
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
Because I'm getting fat.
Who?
No.
One of the other Sisters?
She'd punish me.
Why?
I can't say.
Who?
Yes.
Through someone else?
No.
He talked to you Himself?
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.
H... how?
I put her to sleep.
What did you do?
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
Yes.
You saw it all didn't you?
Yes.
She took the baby in her arms?
Yes.
Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
I don't remember.
It was alive wasn't it?
It was dead.
Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
Agnes, who did this to you?
I hate him.
Who?
For what he made me go through.
Yes.
I hate him for what he did to me.
Of course you do. Who was it?
I hate him...
Agnes who did you see?
Not your fault...
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
No...
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
Stay away from me...
Agnes... Agnes...
It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop.  Let go of me, I wish you were dead.
Yes.
Are you frightened?
Yes.
So she sent you?
From the belltower the day she before she died.
Where?
She'd seen him too.
How did she know about him?
Him.
Who?
So I could go to him.
Why?
Yes.
And the passage to the barn?
The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.
What did she mean?
She said Michael.
I want you to remember if you can a night last January. The night Sister Paul died. Do you remember.
Yes.
Agnes, can you hear me?
Yes.
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Yes.
Do you remember what just happened?
Frightened.
Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two three...  It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel?
No... don't hit me please...
Is someone in the room with you?
Go away, I don't want you here.
Who?
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
Why isn't anyone coming?
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Of what?
I don't know which one
Which one?
I have to throw up...
What do you do?
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
What do you feel?
Yes.
Are you ill?
For me to get sick in.
What do you think it's there for?
No.
Do you know who put it there?
A wastepaper basket.
Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
A crucifix.
What else?
My bed.
Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the baby?  Alright Agnes, I want you to see your room as you saw it on that night.
Sister Marguerite I think.
Who?
Someone's following me.
What is it?
I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
Hm hmm.
We went to chapel for vespers.
And then what happened?
I hate them.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
I ate.
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
I'm afraid.
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
She made me promise not to.
Will she be angry?
I can't tell you that.
Did anyone else know about the baby?
No.
Would you like to tell me?
Yes.
What made it grow?  Do you know?
It grew.
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
May I open my eyes now?
Why?
Yes.
To be a mother?
Because I wasn't worthy.
Why were you afraid?
Because I was afraid.
Why?
No.
Did you want it to come out?
Yes.
Did you know what was going to come out?
It came out of me.
How did you have a baby?
I had a baby.
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
Of telling you.
Of what?
I'm frightened.
What kind of trouble?  What kind of trouble Agnes?
Because I'm in trouble.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
To help me.
And why am I here?
Doctor Livingston.
Who am I?
Yes.
You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.
As much as God loves you.
As much as Mother Miriam does?
I really love you.
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
You're a mistake.
Yes I am.
Are you intelligent?
No I'm not.
Agnes, you're stupid.
Yes.
Are you pretty?
No I'm not.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Alright.
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.
I'm afraid.
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
What?
And then...
Oh, yes.
Her headaches.
How does she know that?
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
Why?
She says my whole body's a mistake.
That you're a mistake?
Yes.
And that you're stupid?
Yes.
She tells you you're ugly?
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
Yes?
... makes me...
Yes?
She...
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
She watches... she listens.
How?
She can.
She can't hurt you any more.
Yes.
She's dead isn't she?
I can't.
You can tell me.
No...
Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
I breathed!
What did you do?
I'm always bad.
What did you do?
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
Sometimes, yes.
Answer me!  You never answer me.
Agnes...
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
And you're unhappy.
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
But you're troubled... aren't you?
I'm not sick.
Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
Agnes...
Everything... I don't have children.
What the child?
I was a mistake.
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
Not my fault.
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint...
Is that what she said?
A mistake... it was a mistake...
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
A mistake...
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
Like you?
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
Because I don't want one.
Why not?
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
Why not?
I could never be a mother.
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
Yes.
Agnes, did you love your mother?
She'd get angry.
Why not?  Mmm?
No, but I can never tell her that.
Do you believe she really saw them?
No.
Do you?
No.
Did your mother see angels often?
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
You'll laugh.
Agnes...
I don't know.
Who?
Somebody told her.
How did she know that?
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
What things?
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
You have trouble sleeping?
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
Where did you go?
It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
Like what?
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
What else did she tell you?
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
You liked Sister Paul?
I don't know.
Why should I?
No... do you?
Do you know a Marie?
Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes.
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
Where do you think babies come from?
What?
One.
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
No questions.
Does it bother you?
Why do you smoke?
I've stopped menstruating
Why not?
I can't have them any more.
Would you like some?
No.
Do you have any children?
Not at the moment, no.
Would you like to be?
No.
Are you married?
Martha Louise Livingston.
What's your real name?
Anything.
Anything?
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
What do you mean?
Would you like to ask them?
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Agnes...
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Then let's talk about something else...
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
Don't you know?
Agnes, how are babies born?
I... I don't understand.
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
From God.
Where'd it come from before that?
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Is that where they say it came from... ?
From their heads...
The baby they made up.
What baby?
Where did the baby come from?
Yes.
In the middle of all the pain?
I fell asleep.
And then what?
I got sicker.
And what happened?
I went to my room.
And what did you do?
Down... there.
Where?
Yes.
Did it hurt?
Something I ate.
How were you sick?
No. I was sick.
Do you remember the night they said it came?
I don't know.
Why should they?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
Would you like to talk about it?
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
In the confessional.
Where do you meet?
Oh, yes.
And you like that?
At least once a week.
Often?
Yes.
You've been alone together?
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
He's told you?
Oh, I know he does.
Do you think he loves you?
Oh, yes!
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Oh, there are so many.
Who?
Yes.
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
I love you.
Uh huh.
Right now?
Well, who in particular?
Everyone.
Who?
Yes.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Love.
Second thing that comes to your mind.
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
First thing that comes to your mind?
Yes.
Anything... may I sit down?
I don't know.
What would you like to talk about.
Let's talk about something else.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
No I'm not.
Was it Sister Marguerite?
That wasn't me.
I just heard you.
No I don't.
You have a lovely voice.
Yes.
Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
Sister...
What?
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
Why?
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
Eve, she strangled a baby!
Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
Thanks.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
Larry...
I don't know.
Something they... that they overlooked.
Larry there's got to be something missing.
Larry...
Thanks...
Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
I can get you new evidence next week.
Next week.
I'll have it.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
I'll have a decision by next week.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
All I want is one more week.
I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
What about Roger? He's free.
I... I'm Martha, Mama.
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
Marie's dead Mama.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
It's your favourite...
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
Uh huh.
The one up on the third floor?
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
How do you survive?
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
What business is it of yours..?
Who told you this?
What does this have to do with..?
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
No.
Wasn't it!
Oh, don't do this!
What happened to the baby?
She can't remember.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
That's enough.
Then she's a liar.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
I left it with her and I went for help.
Before or after you killed the child?
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
You tied the cord around its neck.
No!
And the baby.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
That's a lie.
You wanted that child out of the way.
She didn't want any help.
You went to the room to help with the birth.
The scandal...
The baby?
I don't know... too late to stop it.
Too late for what?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
For what?  An abortion?
I didn't guess until it was too late.
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
Yes.
Did you know she was pregnant?
Is it because she's a nun?
Was it you?
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Who knew she was pregnant?
My God, but you're determined.
I have a few more questions to ask her.
Hasn't she had enough?
Where is she?
This is permission to take her apart.
If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
I'm concerned about her health.
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
Why would I lie?
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
Somebody told her.
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
That's what I have to believe...
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
She is an innocent.
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
But how did it happen?
You're saying God did it?
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
This is insane.
A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
Well give me a reasonable explanation
Don't be ridiculous.
How  ?
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
My God, you're as crazy as...
Why must he be anybody?
Who is he?
The father!
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
She's been touched by God, yes.
You think she's a saint?
For Agnes.
For the Church?
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you.
You're what?
I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
Then let's begin.
Of course.
May I be present?
No.
Would it stop you if I did?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
Begin what?
I'd like to begin.
Listen to her singing.
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth.  No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles.  Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
Become?  One is born a saint.
Do you want to become one?
Yes I do.
Do you think they ever existed?
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
And Saint John would chew tobacco.
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
Mary Magdelen?
Right...
Pipe!
Saint Peter?
Even Christ would partake socially.
Hand rolled.
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course
Long, thin and filtered.
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Fine thanks...
All right?
I'm out of prac...  ... practice.
I'd love one.
Would you like one?  Huh?
No, it reminds me.
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles.
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
And what has that to do with it?
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
Stupid woman... and that's all?
It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said?  She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.
What have we done to hurt you?  And don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do?  Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh?  You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin?
Nothing...
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
You just said...
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
Bullshit yourself!
Bullshit!
Because I am a moral person.
Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh?
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
An unhappy woman...
I know you don't.
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
Her spiritual health.
The woman's health is at stake.
I haven't decided yet.
Don't deny it!
We'll see about that.
I'd like yours too.
And my permission?
Oh, God.
Because I didn't know...
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
I knew that after the fact.
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
Oh God, if only I'd known.
There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.
Oh, dear God.
She molested her!
I don't think I care to know.
Do you know what she did to her?
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
Listening to angels?
Yes.
Like keeping her home from school?
And Agnes' father?
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
Your niece!
About what?
You lied to me
Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
Sister Paul?
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
When was that?
Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...
What sheets?
The sheets...
What is it?
Oh, Dear God...
Was the child full term?
There's nothing here.
Take at look at it.
Yes.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Nothing.
Visitors to the convent.
Earthquakes?
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Oh, some time in January.
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
Answers.
All right, what do you need.
Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
How?
Aquittal.
What?
There's another choice.
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
I am...
Then help her.
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud.
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
???
And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
She is not a child.
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
I'm only interested...
How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
It's my affair too.
How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
The Catholic Church...
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
Nuns... you hate nuns.
What?
You hate us don't you?
And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
Not simple, no.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
She has it now.
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
About two years before.
This was before her pregnancy?
She stopped eating completely...
And what happened?
I was appalled, just as you are now.
And you weren't shocked?
Shortly after she came to us.
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy. No-one. Not even Agnes.
That possibility never occurred to you?
That's absurd!
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
Who?
It's possible isn't it?
You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
I've already told you what I thought.
And in your eyes?
No... not in the eyes of the police.
So, someone else could have done it.
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
That's ridiculous...
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
I believe Agnes is different.
What's your opinion?
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
And I am not from the Middle Ages. I know what you are!  I don't want that mind cut open.
I am not with the Inquisition.
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
The science of psychiatry.
Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
Why do you think that?
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
Look, someone gave her the baby.
She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
Why haven't you asked her?
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
And you didn't try to find out who?
Obviously there was.
Could there have been anyone else?
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
What's his name?
Yes, but I...
Was there a priest?
None as far as I know.
What man had access to her?
I haven't a clue.
Who was the father?
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
How did she hide it during the day?
Yes.
Is that normal?
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
No-one.
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
Unfiltered.
I can beat that.
Two packs a day.
You were a smoker?
You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters.
... Thank you.
You can call me Sister.
Yes... I...
I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
Of course.
Yes.
Pity.
And what do you do about it?
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Is she?
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Why selfish?
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
I bet you don't sound like real people.
What are you?
They ought to be.
But that's not like a real person at all.
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
The big hammer?
What's that mean?
Yes.
No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
I'm not ...
Thank you.
Gear?
I see.  Do you like the play?
Are you pulling my leg?
Oh, it's the way you talk.
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
Are you supposed to be here?
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Oh!
I knew I could rely on you.
Is it? Is it really?
What have you heard?
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
I would have said so.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
Oh yes.
Oh you do, look.
Well, you look like him.
You are.
Oh you are, I know you are.
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
Hello.
I call myself Phoebe.
Phoebe.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
I'm tired. I want to go home.
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
No, it's not.  It's for this.
Because I don't want to.
I don't think I'm going.
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
Yes, Addison.
Yes, Addison.
No-no-no...
That's not true!
I had to get in, to meet Margo! I had to say something, be somebody, make her like me!
She was a liar, she was a liar!
She never proved anything, not a thing!
What of it?
What of it?
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
... taken it for granted? That you and I...
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
I can't believe my ears...
What have you got to do with it?
What do you mean by that?
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
Champion to champion.
I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I-
I never intended you to be.
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
I don't know what I take you for anything...
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
She doesn't know.
Addison, won't it be just perfect? Lloyd and I - there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me, I'll make them be great!  You're the only one I've told, the only one that knows except Lloyd and me...
You have no right to say such things!
I'm in love with Lloyd!
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
I didn't mean just the Theater.
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
Addison...
Lloyd and I.
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
Why'd call me a killer?
Why not?
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
What time?
Stars.
You know me better than that.
It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
Aren't you?
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
Just like it.
What a day - what a heavenly day...
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
I don't think that's funny.
Just like that.
Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
Just some coffee.
You take charge.
I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you...
Eddie...
Yes. The Shubert.
Yes. I do.
That's right.
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
Please do.
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
Margo.
You were there? At the play - last night?
Then you've heard too.
Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast!
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
How nice.
I take it she read well.
Was she that bad?
Just slipped your mind.
How... how was Miss Caswell?
Of course I knew.
Eve! My understudy...
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
It's good luck before an audition. She'll be all right once it starts.
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
Amen.
Then you two must have a long talk-
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
I do not. How do you do?
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
Everything... everything's so funny...
When? When are you going to do it?
I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'...
We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?
Good luck, genius...
Right here. A minute ago.
You've already met.
This is Eve Harrington.
Bill!
Bill-
Bill...
A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen?
A married lady.
You know what I'm going to be?
Groom.
You know why I forgive Eve? Because she's left good behind - the four of us, together like this, it's Eve's fault - I forgive her...
There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
I want everybody to shut up about Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's all I want. Give Karen more wine...  ... never have I been so happy. Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub Room. What a lovely, clever name. Where the elite meet. Never have I seen so much elite - and all with their eyes on me. Waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle. But not tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve... there they go.
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
Pass me the empty bottle. I may find her... why, look. There's Rasputin.
"Please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion - but it's most important that I speak with you. Please" - it's underlined - "meet me in the Ladies' Room. Eve."
Something simple. A fur coat over a nightgown...
I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
Glory Hallelujah.
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
Hear, hear...
Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve?
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
I wish it were.
It's not nonsense.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
Don't be condescending.
Well, I am.
It's obvious you're not a woman.
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
Tell that to Dr. Freud! Along with the rest of it...
Paranoiac!
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
I will not calm down!
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
I mix what I like.
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
I must have frightened her away.
The kid. Junior.
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
So full of meaning, fire and music!
You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell?
Eve?  How enchanting...  Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell?
What's all over?
Everybody has a heart - except some people.  Of course I've got bicarb. There's a box in the pantry. We'll put your name on it. Max Fabian. It'll say there. Always. Just for you.
If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
Thank you.
Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
- guilty.
For instance - you!
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
Twenty minutes!
I don't think that's funny!
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
She's a girl of so many interests.
That never stopped you before.
I had no idea you were even here.
I thought you were going to be late-
Remind me to tell you about when I looked into the heart of an artichoke.
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?
This is my house, not a theater! In my house you're a guest, not a director-!
Happy little housewife...
It won't play.
You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?
I love you too. Good night, darling-
I'll check with Eve...
Okay.
Yeah... I will.
She did...?
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
Many happy returns of the day...
Happy birthday, darling...
Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
Sing it?
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
When - when are you coming back?
That I am...
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
Call me when you get in...
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
Bill...
Take care of yourself out there...
All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
Byron couldn't have said it more graciously... here we go-
Can't keep his eyes off my legs.
Where's my coat?
Oh well...  ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught-
Heaven help me, I love a psychotic.
I'm a junk yard.
Show me a human and I might have!
Thank you so much.
Find out.
You hear all kinds of things.
You think?
- and for you.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
Don't run away, Bill.
Everything.
So am I.
Is that what you want me to be?
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
Are you proud of me, Bill?
Yes. Yes, it does.
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
Of course not.
I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.
Every day.
I read George Jean Nathan every week.
So few come back...
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
I just asked a simple question.
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
Is it the money?
Why you have to go out there.
Why.
I just wondered.
You said forty-seven minutes. You'll never make it.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people...
What did you expect - live sables?
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
But she just got here...
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.
Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie.
No thanks, Birdie.
Lemme fix you a drink.
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
Don't be dense. The party.
Late for what?
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
You all put together?
I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
How do you mean that?
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
Like an agent with one client.
She's loyal and efficient-
Night an' day.
She works hard.
Now you want an argument.
Why not?
No.
An answer.
Do you want an argument or an answer?
You don't like Eve, do you?
Hmm?
Birdie-
She's got two things to do - carry clothes an' press 'em wrong - an' just let anybody else muscle in...
Oh-oh.
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
Well?
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
Behind in your dues? How much?
If I may so bold as to say something - did you ever hear the word "union"?
Just because you can't even work a zipper. It was very thoughtful, Eve, and I appreciate it-
Adorable. We now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop.
I couldn't get into the girdle in two an' a half hours...
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it.
See you home...
Kill the people.  Got your key?
Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
If I haven't, I'll find something till you're normal.
I'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, Birdie dear.
Miss Coonan...
Oh, brother.
And this is my good friend and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.
Oh, brother.
How do you do, my dear.
Well. I guess a real tight girdle help when you're playin' a lunatic.
Of course!
The same size?
Buy some.
You need new girdles.
I never played Fort Sumter.
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-
You rest. I'll get it...
That's the door.
I don't care if I never get home.
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
How long does it take?
Subway.
How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
Don't bother.
I'll just pick up the broken glass.
The maid'll fix it in the morning.
That spilled drink is going to ruin your carper.
I might.
You're going to Hollywood - aren't you?  From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time.
Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn. Barbara Stanwyck, Susan Hayward - of course, they're just movie stars.
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
I've heard of them.
About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
What report? To whom?
It was for my report.
Probably not.
You probably won't believe me.
What for?
That's all.
You were just looking around...
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
How did you get in here?
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!
I - I guess I fell asleep.
What are you doing here?
Miss Harrington...
Who are you?
Thank you, Karen.
Congratulations, Eve.
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
She knows enough not to be here.
I'd do much more - for a part that good.
A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
That won't be necessary. Addison knows how Margo happen to miss that performance - how I happened to know she'd miss it in time to call him and notify every paper in town...  ... it's quite a story. Addison could make quite a thing of it - imagine how snide and vicious he could get and still write nothing but the truth. I had a time persuading him...  ... you'd better sit down. You look a bit wobbly.  If I play "Cora," Addison will never tell what happened - in or out of print. A simple exchange of favors. And I'm so happy I can do something for you - at long last...  Your friendship with Margo - your deep, close friendship - what would happen to it, do you think, if she knew the chap trick you'd played on her - for my benefit? And you and Lloyd - how long, even in the Theater, before people forgot what happened - and trusted you again?  No... it would be so much easier on everyone concerned, if I were to play "Cora." And so much better theater, too...
Over my dead body...
Addison wants me to play it.
I don't think anything in the world could make me say that.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
Something most important you can do.
I think I know...
Give yourself time. Don't worry too much about what people think, you're very young and very talented...  ... and, believe it or not, if there's anything I can do-
I wish I could believe that.
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
I'll never get over it.
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
He can help you.
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
- an understudy's performance.
But the raves about your performance-
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
I'm not crying.
Eve... don't cry.
You've really got a low opinion of me, haven't you? We'll I'll give you some pleasant news. I've been told off in no uncertain terms all over town. Miss Channing should be happy to hear that. To know how loyal her friends are - how much more loyal they are than she had a right to expect me to be...
Let's not get over-dramatic.
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
Why shouldn't you?  Please sit down.
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
Oh, but there is-
There can't be very much-
I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
Can't we sit down? Just for a minute...
I don't intend to be.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
Don't get up.  And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
I was wondering whether you'd come at all..
Nothing definite yet - it's just to have lunch.
They certainly don't waste much time.
We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
Please...
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
May I have your coat?
No, Eve, I won't forget...
Karen...  ... you won't forget, will you? What we talked about before?
Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
I seem to be forever thanking you for something, don't I?
I won't forget.
You won't forget it?
Of course.
Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it?
They'll do as they're told.
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
I think she would cheer.
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
The show must go on.
Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
Well... Miss Channing's affairs are in such good shape... there isn't enough to keep me as busy as I should be, really - not that I've ever considered anything that would take me away from her... but the other day - when I heard Mr. Fabian tell Miss Channing that her understudy was going to have a baby, and they'd have to replace her...
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
Karen...  ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
Karen.
Mrs. Richards.
Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
Tell me, Eve - how are things with you? Happy?
Hollywood.
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up...  ... whose is it?
I'd like that.
Not just that way. As a friend...
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-
I think I'd better. It's been - well, I can hardly find the words to say how it's been...
You're not going, are you?
It couldn't possibly interest you.
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
Well...
Try...
If I only knew how...
My husband...
Hello, Miss Channing.
Not at all.  Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
I thought you'd forgotten about me.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan...
She's got to meet you-
Oh, no...
I'm going to take you to Margo...
Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
Oh, no. I see the play.
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
He's the best.
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
Not at all.
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
Why should you think I wouldn't be?
So there you are. It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
Farmers were poor in those days, that's what dad was - a farmer. I had to help out. So I quit school and I went to Milwaukee. I became a secretary. In a brewery.  When you're a secretary in a brewery - it's pretty hard to make believe you're anything else. Everything is beer. It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home -  and there was a Little Theater Group... like a drop of rain in the desert. That's where I met Eddie. He was a radio technician. We played 'Liliom' for three performances, I was awful - then the war came, and we got married. Eddie was in the air force - and they sent him to the South Pacific. You were with the O.W.I., weren't you Mr. Richards?  That's what 'Who's Who' says... well, with Eddie gone, my life went back to beer. Except for a letter a week. One week Eddie wrote he had a leave coming up. I'd saved my money and vacation time. I went to San Francisco to meet him.  Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee - the one that came from Washington to say that Eddie wasn't coming at all. That Eddie was dead...  ... so I figured I'd stay in San Francisco. i was alone, but couldn't go back without Eddie. I found a job. And his insurance helped... and there were theaters in San Francisco. And one night Margo Channing came to play in 'Remembrance'... and I went to see it. And - well - here I am...
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
Well... it started with the play before this one...
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
I'd like anything Miss Channing played...
No, thank you.  Yes. I've seen every performance.
How do you do, Mr. Richards.
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
Why not?
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
Really, Eve? Why?
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
How are you making out in Mr. Fabian's office?  I don't want you working the child too hard, Max - just because you promised. As you see, I kept my promise, too...
Hello, Miss Channing.
Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start? Oh, hello, Eve...
I had no idea you knew each other.
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
Of course.
Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
I'd like to hear it.
I wouldn't like.
If you'd like.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
Mr. Sampson's birthday. I certainly wouldn't forget that. You'd never forgive me.  As a matter of fact, I sent him a telegram myself...
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
Right here.
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
I've got it.
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
No trouble at all.
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
While you're cleaning up, I'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-
They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
The curtains. I made them myself.
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
Performance number one thousand of this one - if I play it that long - will take place in a well-padded booby hatch...
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
What - again?
I won't be a minute.
Well - if I'm not in the way...
Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk.
The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
No, don't go...
San Francisco. It was the last week. I went one night... the most important night in my life - until this one. Anyway... I found myself going the next night - and the next and the next. Every performance. Then, when the show went East - I went East.
Did you see it here in New York?
Not with you in them. Not by Mr. Richards...
There are other plays...
Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.
Of course it is.
Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
You'll be there, won't you.
I remember.
Very classy stuff, lots of technique-
Check.
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
With tears.
With tears?
Well... all right.
Karen, in all the years of our friendship, I have never let you go to the Ladies' Room alone. But now I must. I am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there...
The little witch must have had Indians runners out snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up... well, she won't get away with it! Nor will Addison deWitt and his poison pen! If Equity or my lawyer can't or won't do anything about it, I will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down Mr. deWitt's ugly throat...
Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
In this rat race, everybody's guilty till they're proved innocent! One of the differences between the Theater and civilization...  ... what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance!
I can't believe Eve said those things!
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
I just can't believe it.
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
About what?
Margo.  Margo, I want you to know how sorry I am about this...
Let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. To so many things I want to be for Bill... funny business, a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. Sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. Without that, you're not woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman...  ... slow curtain. The end.
Well...
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
Isn't that what they always say?
Not to you. Not to Bill.
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
Why should he - and why should you?
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
He's in love with you.
What about Bill?
What about Bill?
And what is that? Besides something spelled out in light bulbs, I mean. Besides something called temperament, which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice... infants behave the way I do, you know. They carry on and misbehave - they'd get drunk if they knew how - when they can't have what they want. When they feel unwanted and insecure - or unloved.
You're Margo. Just - Margo.
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
I detest cheap sentiment.
It doesn't matter.
Do you want it on?
Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas.
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
Not many car either, not much chance of a lift...
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
Three or four miles...
How far to the station?
Roughly ten minutes.
How much time have we?
Peace and quit is for libraries.
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...
I'm so happy you're happy.
Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
Please don't play governess, Karen, I haven't your unyielding good taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter...  I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR should I say "ain't I"?
Margo, really...
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't you sit down?
Harrington.
Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
The heave-ho.
She's just outside the door.
You've what?
Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you.
They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
They're your fans, your audience-
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
Ain't it the truth?
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
It's the tight girdle that does it.
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
Hi.  Hello, darling-
Then tell me this isn't true! That your concern for your play and career is one thing - and that poor frightened hysterical girl another - and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either your play or your career!
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
I'm a human being, I've got some!
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
Nothing...
Not much.
Nothing much. She apologized.
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
What are you going to wear?
Margo!
Such as?
They'd die without each other.
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
It strikes me that Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious!
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."
With gestures, of course.
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
I'm beginning to catch up.
I'm trying hard to follow you.
That's quite a change of subject.
I wonder why.
That was a pity...
Eve?
Where'd you get all that information?
Don't joke about such things.
You'll break your neck on that ice.
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
Lloyd, be careful...
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
What time is it?
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
It's going to be a cozy weekend.
Margo hasn't done badly by it.
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
It's just possible she didn't...
That's on time for Margo.
Margo, again...
Lloyd, what happened...?
In a minute...
It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.
If you'd only see her, you're her whole life - you must have spotted her by now, she's always there...
You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-
The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
Loud.
It means I've finally got a life to live! I don't have to play parts I'm too old for - just because I've got nothing to do with my nights!  I know you've made plans. I'll make it up to you, believe me. I'll tour a year with this one, anything - only you do understand - don't you, Lloyd?
Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
I mean really, deeply angry...
She is a louse.
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
Yes, sir.
Too bad.
Thank you, Lloyd. Godspeed.
How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on.
It's not important whether you do. We are wearing long underwear.
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
It's right to the point. Also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you - so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them!
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
To you, too?
I'm sure.
I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...
It seems almost inconceivable that I haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. So Eve is not working for Max after all-  - Max you sly puss.
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
Don't be evasive.
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
How's the new one coming?
When you do, let me in on it.
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
Shucks. And my autograph book is at the cleaners.
Who's left out there?
Where is she?
What is he talking about?
... Among so many quiet qualities.
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
Would you, really? How sweet-
Within your time, buster. Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts. Write me one about a nice, normal woman who shoots her husband.
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
I placed...?
That's right, but I don't understand-
Call, what call?
Hello..
My dear Horowitz. In the first place, I'm paying you union scale. Second, it's my piano. Third, if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine, they can get off the vine and go home. "Liebestraum."
"Liebestraum."
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
Play it again.
"Liebestraum."
Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
I didn't hear you.
Answer my question!
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
That's my Max.
Promise.
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
You get quick action, don't you?
Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
Anything to help you out, Max.
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
When's the audition?
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
Miss Caswell?  What?
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
I love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.
Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
The ones who could disburse the money.
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
...No... never in so many words...
One minute but then--
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
You've really got to go.
Then don't.
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
Well, that's what your friends call you.  I mean...I feel like I'm one of your friends now...and also...your girlfriend.
Oz, it's okay, I know.
This isn't any better, Chris.
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
What's that?
You're missing the game for us?!
What about the game?!
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
You can't sing at the competition.
...yeah.
So we're gonna be close next year?
Sure.
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
What?
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
That's nice.
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
Stifler told me.
Hi...
Yeah?  Well you can't fake your way through this.  You better practice.
Why are you doing this?
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
I'm glad you think so.
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
Okay.  So I had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone --
Come on!  I won't tell.
What's your middle name?
Do I have to?
Um...Chris --
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
Of course, I didn't --
Okay.  I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Not bad, Chris.
Sure.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
...I've never tried it.
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
I think I've had one.
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
He likes it.
Please.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
That's not why we're going out.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
What?  We both have cars.
Yeah right.
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I embellished a little bit.  Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman?
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
Are you kidding?  No.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
No comment.
Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
Do you love her?
Do you?
No.
No you haven't.
You got it, stud.
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
Okay!
Don't you want me to?
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Well, this one time?  At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it?  But it's called spin the bottle?  And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips?  And...
You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Michelle.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
No, Kevin --  That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing.  That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
Yeah.
I love you.
I want to hear you say it.
Okay.
I don't know.  How do you?
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Yeah.
You sure you're comfortable?
Yeah, are you?
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
No...I know the perfect time...
Kevin...  I want to have sex with you.
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
Okay.
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
But you don't love me.
Kevin?  Do you not love me?
Yes --
I think you're so right, Kevin.
Like how?
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
Oh...ungghhhhh!
How?
I think "shithead" really says it.
Not for you.
Let me know.
Tonight?
Oh, Kev.
Kevin, this is serious!
You think so?
Andy...
You too.
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
Well, they are French.
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
What?
No wonder he let her go.
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
I know where he'll go.
We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
We don't both have to die.
You know what. Kill me. Cut out my fucking heart. Go on! Do it!
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
Shut up! You fucking shut up! What do you want? Huh? What the hell do you want?
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
Holy mother of God...
I hope they fucking fry us all.
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
Are you crazy!?
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
They're coming!
I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.
I don't know...
What makes you so sure this will work?
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
Andy! No!
I know. He told me.
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
Are you okay?
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
I'll be right back. Stay put.
Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
A la votre.
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
Don't you want to change?
What about your glasses?
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
Fan-fucking-tastic?
So... you feel okay now?
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
Andy! Holy shit!
You must get out of here. It's not safe.
Andy!
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Uh-huh. Good for you.
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
Salots! Shitfucker!
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
You fucking liar!
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
Andy!
Andy, stop! I think he can help you -
Then come find me.
Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
I have to go now, before it gets light.
I'm not sure but look. . .
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
Poor Meetoo!
Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
Not you. Him.
You'll laugh.
No! I look ridiculous!
You must have.
I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
Who's Sophie?
I'm fine.
Noooo....
Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
Well, I don't have any money . . .
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
Don't let me go!
Dmitri?
I'm glad you	did too.
No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
I'm so scared...
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
Oh! I'm sorry...
I'm sorry.
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
You said you wouldn't laugh!
What a beautiful ship!
The dessert fork!
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
You shouldn't have pushed us!
No!
HUH?!
Forged papers! Now, what?!
Just what do you think you're doing?!
Why?
I'm going to stretch my legs
By pulling my hair?!
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
I have my reasons.
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
And this is my future. This is who I am!
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
Why does everyone have to act that way?
Dmitri didn't want the money?
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
Lyndon Johnson?
Yeah, Earl Warren?
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
We've been through this.
Alvy.
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
Portchnik.
Allison.
Do you feel all right?
Yes.
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
It's okay.
Why not?
Yes.
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
Who are you?
Oh!
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.
I'm late.
Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
You're mad, aren't you?
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
I guess these are all yours. Impeach, uh, Eisenhower... Impeach Nixon... Impeach Lyndon Johnson... Impeach Ronald Reagan.
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
What?
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that.
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
God.
Oh-
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
Oh, good. Okay.
Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
Yeah.
Nothing at all?
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
God, it's so clean out here.
God.
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
Alvy, come on, for your own experience. I mean, you wanna write, why not?
Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
That's sick!
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
Thing?
What thing?
Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?
Oh! My God!
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
What... huh?
Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Oh, darn it.
Yeah, but it's real close.
Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
Holy cow!
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Yeah.
Okay, okay. Okay.
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
Yeah.
Yeah?
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
Was there somebody in your room when I called you?
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
It's for my complexion.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
I think I left it there, I'm sorry.
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Two?
Yeah?
Oh. What?
Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
It was just great!
Yeah.
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
No.
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
There's a spider in the bathroom.
Oh.
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
Life. I said, "life."
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
Will it change my life?
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
and I keep, you know, it's-
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Yeah.
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
M'hm.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
M'hm.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
I'm home!
It's his name.
You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
Who cares? Who cares?
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Well, what is your definition of following?
You followed me!
You followed me. I can't believe it!
It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
Were you always funny?
M'hm.
Well, I need grass and so do you.
Oh, you have my body.
Let's just do it, all right?
U-huh.
No, I'm fine.
Uh-uh-why?
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
What are you doing?
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
It relaxes me.
Well, have you ever made love high?
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
What?  Hey, listen, what-what do you think? Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight?
Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel."
Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
Yes, it is.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
How is it any different?
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh?
Mine.
You don't want me to live with you?
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
I have a tiny apartment.
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
Of course.
I dunno.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
Yeah.
Do I love you?
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
Ooooh!
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
No, I'm not.
You see, like you and I...
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah.
Oh! Italian, right?
Yeah.
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
M'hm.
U-huh.
M'hm.
Yeah.
M'hm.
M'hm.
M'hm.
Yeah?
Yeah?
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
H'm?
What? What?
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
Yeah?
Here, you want some?
No.
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
No.  You're a wreck.
Yeah?
Oh, yeah?
H'm?
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
Oh.
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
We can digest our-
Yeah.
Okay.
Oh, all right.
Yeah.
Really?
What?
Yeah, you know something? I never even took a lesson, either.
Yeah?
Really, do you think so, really?
No, I'm gonna quit!
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
Yeah.
it's my first time.
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
what I mean?
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
I know.
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
Yeah. Oh, God bless!
Fifteen years, huh?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Oh, I see, I see.
Why not?
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
Neat, yeah.
Right. Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know.
Oh, yeah.
M'hm...
Fifteen-aw, come on, you're... yeah, really?
Fifteen years?
Oh, you see an analyst?
Okay.
You sure?
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Well...
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, my grammy.
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
Huh? Oh... yeah.
Don't be funny.
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Huh?
Oh, right.
Oh, you do?
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
All right.
Okay, that's good.
Okay.
Well, where is it? I-
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
Wisconsin.
No, Chippewa Falls.
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
Yeah, well, I'm, but I...
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Me? Oh, downtown!
I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
Oh, no, I have a car.
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God, whatta-  whatta dumb thing to say, right? I mean, you say it, "You play well," and right away... I have to say well. Oh, oh... God, Annie.  Well... oh, well... la-de-da, la-de- da, la-la.
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
Hi. Hi, hi.
Oh, I'd say so. You married-
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
He was creepy.
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
All right. All right. All right.
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
Get him!
Oooh! Here! Here!
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There.
Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
I mean, you've been married before, you know how things can get. You were very hot for Allison at first.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
I-you know, I don't wanna.
Alvy, I...
That movie makes me feel guilty.
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
Oh!
Stop it, Alvy!
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
The alarm clock.
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
Well, stop listening to him.
H'h, that's a polite word for what you are.
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
Two minutes, Alvy.
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
Where are you going?
Oswald and ghosts.
I have a headache.
My head is throbbing.
I can't.
Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
Dammit! I was so close.
Oh, I'm sorry!
There are people out there from The New Yorker magazine. My God! What would they think?
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
Here you are. There's people out there.
No jokes-these are friends, okay?
Commentary.
Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
Why are you so hostile?
I just have time to get the, uh-
You think so? Do you really?
No.
Yes, I do.
Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
Oh, yes, yes.
We really had a good time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know. I don't know.
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
Oh.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
Oh, gosh.
Oh.
Hey-
Yeah.
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
Oh. What about?
No, no, no, not at all.
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
Well, hi!
Oh.
One guess.
You're fucking desperate.
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
Would it make a difference?
Why didn't you come in?
A triumph.  When did you get here?
Honey?
I...wait, what are you talking about?
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
It's always not this time.  If you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone.
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy.
So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
It's alright, isn't it?
My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
It's not going to come up.
Just don't fucking tell her.
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
Why would she care?
I'd love a Xanex.  Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
You want a Tylenol, or something?
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
I'd say it was down.
I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
I'll change back before we leave.
Borrow whatever you like.
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
Oh.
They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
Well, probably.
Didn't I say?
Oh.
To dander.  Otis.
Oh.
He's allergic.
Why didn't you bring him?
What?
Why didn't you bring him?
This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.
I'm not.
Of course.
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
Oh my God, the sitter.
Let's get the kids.
I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
You should have brought him.
So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
What is that thing?
With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
So where is young Jonah?
Really?
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
Really.
Never.
Don't you miss it?
I'm glad that's all over for me.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.
Count on it.
Take good care of it.
Damn straight.
It's not a contest.
And you're not the wife.
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
He's not going tonight.
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
Yeah.
He's gonna miss his flight.
I love her too, Joe.
Would you leave us alone right now?
Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two.  Can you help me with this stuff?
Thanks for coming.
I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag.  You just need to get into a car and go.
You need to call your dad.
She left a note.
She's in ICU.
Lucy overdosed.
Harry called.
Let's go upstairs, okay?
I love you, Joe Therrian.
Escape hatch.
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.
Oh, very jealous.
Just did.  Jealous?
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
Directing suits you.
Sally?
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary, scout.
I never put myself in harm's way.
I'm the hired help.
You have?
Excuse me?
We live next door.
Monica.
Not as a rule.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Hm.  We should do it again.
A perfect night.
Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus.
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah...
Are you my big hard hero?
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?
There's a test, you know.
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
Nice to meet you.
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
Ryan's novel.
Take your time, Jer.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
You're out of your mind.
Scout's honor.
Yes.
Whatever you say.
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
We'll be fine.
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
He's directing now.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
Well, you're a tower of support.
We've only been over this how many times?
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
I adore him.
I love you, you're a genius.
Fantastic.  Out here.
Sure.
I know.
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
Ah...
He's my favorite.
It's a Calder.
Me too.
Me too.
I guess.
Okay.
You don't have to.
I'll be with you.
Everybody hates the messenger.
I know.
Yes.
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
You think this was to hurt you?!  My God, Joe.  It isn't about you.
I wanted you back.
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
Don't.
Anyone else?
Cal, too?
Mac?  Mac says it?  Cal?
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
It's a shit novel anyway.
I don't look my age, Joe.
What are you saying?
About me!
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
And how hard it hit?
It's not like this all the time.
You walked out on a five year marriage.
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
Otis!!!!
Fuck you.
There are fucking coyotes out there.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
She left the fucking gate open.
Don't be so sure.
Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
It's ecstasy, Sal.
Not properly watered.
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
Truce?
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
Still champions.
It's alright.  Be our guests.
Well, not yet.  The gate was open?
Yes.
In the kitchen.
And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
Really?
I'm going to throw up.
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
I mean, you're really back.
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
No.  Did you?
What?
Through the sweats or not?
In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
Hardly...
Happy anniversary, baby.
No luck.
Ours.
The infamous dog?
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
Don't be silly.
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
Lovely.
We have a gift?
I'm so sorry.
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
That's very nice.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
Yes.
Medallions.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
Ryan's really angry with me.
Lemon.
Okay.
What am I, five?
I'm a little in the puke zone.
I've never done this before.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
I will treasure this.
Would you sign it for me.  I'm sure this is inappropriate.
I'll be your best friend.
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
And Ryan works at home.
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
A little out of my element.
I'm a little nervous, so...
Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't.
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
Sally did all this herself?
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
Something soft.
Please, Ryan.
I think there are sixteen there.
You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
Not good.
Well...wow...
I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?
I didn't say a word.
Trust him.
Of course it's alright.
Let's just go home, okay?
Don't go in, Ryan.
All the ugly phone calls?  We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan.  They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH.
Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  Because, God help you if something happens to that dog?
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.
I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  Ryan, you're a great man.
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
I think you need to speak for yourself, Ryan.  But I think you're really nice people...
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
I love it here.  Don't you love it here, Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love tonight.  And I love these people.  And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.  Utterly fantastic.
He always has two or three going...
Ryan.
How long ago was it?
I...
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
I'm so sorry.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
I'm sorry.
I did it.
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
I so wish I'd known.
Yes.
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
Hors d'oeuvres or something?
Are you working on a new book?
Ryan!
Oh?
We could hardly say no.
Yes.  And you've met Joe.
Sally?
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
Very.
Are you asking me to marry you?
If he were still alive, maybe.
Yeah.
Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Do Peter Sellers again.
Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Really??
Oh?
Thank you.
Oh?
No, no thanks.
Yes.
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
Panes?
We're going to have to go back out there.
Thank you, Panes.
That's not an answer, is it?
Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
Thanks.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
No.  Not something new.
I never like to talk about my work.
I don't want to talk about it.
Yes.  Fine.
You're a shit.
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
About five thousand dollars.  With my discount.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
Shit!
Everyday.
You know it's true.
We're just feeling our way back.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
Okay.
Like the last time.
Like the last time.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
Fuck you, Panes.
How?
She's all over him, are you blind?
Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me.
Panes is here!
Will champagne help?
Are you lovesick?
Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
Monica and Ryan.
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.
You're keeping a record, are you?
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
Well, so glad you decided to come.
Relax.  You've done enough.
I don't mind...
You don't need to do that.
What are they?
Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
I'll be right out.
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
No you are not.  You're Sally Nash. Listen to me, you're Sally Nash.  You're my best friend and I love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child.  "Oh now I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director..." English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's probably going to leave you for Skye Davidson anyway.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Why are you doing this?
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
Not nice.  Not kind.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
You don't have kids to keep a marriage together, Sally.  It's only five months since Joe came back.
His sister does.  Big time.  And the New York Times says addiction is genetic -- I'll e-mail you the article.
Neither does Joe.
I don't have a drug problem.
You weren't exactly horrified.
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
And Cal's this massive adult?
Don't try and change the subject.  Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.
Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
What do you mean, thank God?
Oh honey, let's.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Well good.  Thank God.
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
And the food sucks, I know.
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
Oh Soph...
I trust you.
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.
Big time.
So how much do you hate her?
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
The both of you.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
A notch above the storage room.
It's much more personal in here.
I thought it was okay where it was.
So where should I put it?
Hm.
She's such a great photographer.
Yes.
Isn't this a fabulous picture?
Would you like to meet my husband?
Nevermind.
I hope they're watercolors!
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
Like Joe.
Ah.
He's a novelist.
And she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over.  Because you're both, so, what - introspective?  And you should have done it ages ago.  I'm Sophia Gold.  Come meet my husband, Cal.
And here they are!
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
Evie has a little something for you.
Enough about me.
Because...because he's <u>twice</u> the ant that you are.  I could <u>never</u> go through with marrying you.  I'm -- I'm an <u>individual</u>, and when I get married, it'll be to someone <u>I</u> choose.
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...
So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?
General -- we have to talk sometime!
A <u>few</u>?
Z!  what are you doing?
Oh no...
There's something going on, Z --
You held onto this all that time?
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
Come on, Z.
<u>This is all your fault</u>!!!
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire...
Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
Well...no, but --
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
Stop fooling around in there.
Out here I'm just what?
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Wait, I hear something!
Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
We're going to die!
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
Water...water...
That's not a name!  That's just a letter!
Worker!  Come back here now!
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
I <u>didn't</u> choose him.  What kind  of <u>idiot</u> would...  ...<u>choose</u> who she wanted to marry?
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
I order you to find out where we are!
What <u>was</u> that thing?
SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
Quiet -- sshhh!!
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER!
He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
No weirdly...You remind me of someone...
You dance...
No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
Yes.
I'm Princess Bala.
You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
Let me think.  Hmmnn...  Never.  Bye!
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?  Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo!
You're right!
Really?
Are you sure this is a real dance?
<u>What</u>?
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Wanna dance?
Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
And do Princesses do improper things?
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go!
The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
Mom!
Who is that idiot?
Yes...he's wonderful...
You did?
It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
Shut up and deal!
Seven --  -- queen.
I'm going to send him a fruit cake every Christmas.
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
Mind if I come in?
Are you sure? How's your knee?
Are you all right?
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Oh.
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
I guess so.
I never thought he'd do it.
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
How's everything at the apartment?
Fine. How's your eye?
Oh.
I don't?
What?
The dishes?
Cheers.
You usually eat alone?
I see you bought some napkins.
Shall I light the candles?
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
Are we dressing for dinner?
Yes, nurse.
No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
That's terrible.
In the knee?
Where?
No, I don't.
Over a girl?
You did?
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
I really ought to be getting home. My family will be flipping by now.
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
I know so. He's a taker.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
Oh.
Are you supposed to?
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
I don't want to talk to him.
For me?
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
Who'd care?
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
I just want some fresh air.
Would you mind opening the window?
Who was that?
Sure.
Do I have to?
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Why not?
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
You really think so?
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
Was he really upset when you told him?
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
I don't want it.
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
I think I'm going to give it all up.
You don't have to entertain me.
I'm not very good at it.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
Open it.
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
He doesn't give a damn about me.
Thanks for reminding me.
But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
They had to pump it out.
No -- it's my stomach.
As soon as I can walk.
Miss.
Baxter.
I mean -- her apartment.
In his apartment.
Someone from the office.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
No -- I don't want anything.
I just want to go brush my teeth --
You don't want me here --
Where's my dress? I have to go home.
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.
I don't understand --
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
All right. Have a nice Christmas.
Your phone.
I know. I like it this way -- makes me look the way I feel.
What is it?
Here.
I think so.
I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
Why?
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
This is a bad day for me.
Much better.
Of course not.
No -- I like it.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
I thought so.
How many of those drinks did you have?
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
Cheers.
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
You shouldn't.
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out.  'Bye.
Oh.
How come?
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
So I see.
How is your cold?
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
What time does the show go on?
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
No. Like a man.
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
You mean tonight?
Sure.
No.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
Good night.
Fine.  Wait.
I hope everything goes all right.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
Twenty-seven.
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
That makes me feel just terrible.
Oh, I never catch colds.
Say, you got a lulu.
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!
My shoes.
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Good night?
Not so rough, honey.
I'm with you, lover.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
No kidding.
Say, this is Snugsville.
I don't know you at all. BUD Permit me -- C.C. Baxter -- junior executive, Arthur Murray graduate, lover.
Still stuck on her, huh.
You got a girl-friend?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Family?
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
Please -- just let me sleep.
Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.
I don't know.
No.
I took sleeping pills.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Dreyfuss.
Doctor.
Sleeping pills.
Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.
You fool -- you damn fool.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
Well -- thank you.
Will you excuse me?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, I know.
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
The nerve.
He wouldn't.
Baxter?
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
Atlantic City?
All set for what?
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
You'll miss your train, Jeff.
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
Yeah, we better.
Merry Christmas.
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --
I have that date -- remember?
You know I do.
Are you sure that's what you want?
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
Handle what?
Okay. I'm sorry.
I wasn't trying.
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
We talked about a lot of things.
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
Not very -- but I'm going to be there anyway.
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man. Then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains. So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and it all begins to look so ugly --
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
Six weeks. But who's counting?
Yes, I know. You want a lock to carry in your wallet?
That's right.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
Go where?
What gives?
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
I told you -- with my mother.
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
I don't want to talk any more.
That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
How did she..?
Oh.
Had?
My dad was a Navy doctor.
Six months.
Why?
Sam?  We haven't seen him.
Somewhere along the pipeline.
The radio's on the fritz.
-- Corbett's a killer.
I was hoping you had some news --
Have you talked to Eric?
My home is here.  With you.
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
You're hurt.
I'm staying.
So what's the problem?
Where's Corbett?
What's going on?
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
That's my line.
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
Wait a second.
High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.
Not me.  I'm equipped.
Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.  Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  What's that?
Do I want to be with you permanently?  Yes, I think I do. But be with what you do and the way you live?  That I don't know. C'mon, Eric, until I met you, coming back to Alaska was totally
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
That's not what I meant.
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
Was there any trouble?
Did you catch Corbett?
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
The little creep hates it that Eric actually does what the company hired him to do.
I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back.
I bet you haven't had lunch.
Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
Be careful -- there're two of them.
What are you doing?
Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car.
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
I love you.
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
What is it you want? What?
Leave me be! Why are you doing this? Why are you picking at my sores... What is it that you want?... You want what? What's with you? I hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all I want is to not do this has some purpose.  What is it, Mom? No kidding.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
Huh?
Do you love me?
Stay out of this...  Doctor?
No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
Don't be silly. How bad?
They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
No.
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
His home number.
Me. My home number is on this card.
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
It's amazing these things weren't done.
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
No.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
Emergency room only.
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
Yes.
Have they done blood tests on him?
Since forever.
How long has he been having problems?
I'm a waitress.
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.  She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do?
Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better...  and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and...  you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
You know what? I...
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
Okay.
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
Because...
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
I wasn't asleep!!
What are you doing here?
What job?
Grouchy?
What do you want?
What do you want, Melvin?
Okay. Good-bye.
Go ahead.
You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
I can trust my brain.
Yeah... Well...
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
I'll take a bus.
It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
I don't.
I don't want to hear that music right now.
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
To hell with sex.
I'll never forget you said it.
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
Sex with Simon?
If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
Here's the trouble with never.
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
Fries.
And mean it...
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
And?
You wanna dance?
You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
Stop asking everyone.
My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
No.
Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
Hey -- you let him...
Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
Thanks, Melvin.
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
Hi.
Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
Yes.
Hello?
No.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
My son.
I can't. I work.
The stiff one eye?
No, sir...
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
Thank you.
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
What you did changed my life.
Okay.
So. Anything else?
I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.
Getting loud, getting loud.
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
Yes.
Just how grateful I am.
I'm not kidding.
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because...
Why did yo do this for me?
That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
Yes.
Uh, Udall?
No!!! Stay away from me!
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
How do you know about my mother?
My son is sick, okay?
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
What are you doing here?
You all set here?
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
Oh, please...
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
Sorry.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
So what are you doing with a dog?
Spence.
Spencer.
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
What do you care?
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
Okay.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
It's not your table. It's the place's table. Behave. This once, you can sit at someone else's station.
I know. He's just the best.
Will you please take it?
Don't want to. I love you.
One night with me!
But what about...
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
All right, cut me a break.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
Stop staring. Do a vase.
No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
Good night.
Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
Why? What have you been thinking about?
I'm sorry... are you okay?
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
What a nice compliment.
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
Yes. I really would.
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
Oh, God.  I see it!
Was nice.
What?
Okay.
Right.
Shit.
What?
Martin.
I know.  That's why I'm attracted to you.  I mean, you make me nervous. You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all I can really think about right now is kissing you.
That doesn't sound normal.
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
Uh-huh.
When did it start?
Were you attracted to me right away?
Is this becoming complicated?
Was she the only one?
Did you --
What happened to her?
Who was she?
It happened to you before?
Attraction is a complication?
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
Why?
Are you attracted to me?
Am I attractive?
Can I ask you something?
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
Why?
What?
He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl.  I watched my parents have this big fight, really big.  I thought my mother was going to kill my father. Then they went into their room and made up.  And I watched them make love through the keyhole.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
I know.  It makes me crazy.
No?
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex.
I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them.  I wanted to, so I did.
Nobody ever sees me.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
I went into their room this afternoon.
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
Did you think they were newlyweds?
So?
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
I think I got one today.
Do you have ulcers?
Ten years later, here you are again.
You didn't take it.
Was that it?
What did he want?
What happened?
Ten years ago.
I don't believe that.
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
For Nicholai?
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
Except --
Sounds pretty well figured out.
We split the money?
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
That means you won't have a gun.
What?  What if he brings it with him?
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
Okay.  Then what?
But he won't shoot you right then?
Check.
Fine.
They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
Cheap as shit.
Two way?
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
Where did you learn it?
The beach?  It was nice.
Sorry.
Book.  Sunglasses.  Great.
Really?
I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.
What do you think he's doing?
In Costa Blanca.
Do you think he's here?
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
That sounds nice.
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
What happens if you do?
Not even a stalemate?
But you've never figured out a way to win.
Do you think about the game?
Oh.  What do you think about?
Why not?
What?
You were there?
I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say?
About?
Hey, where are you?
Where is it?
Several.
You said you didn't trust it.
No.  Something honest.
Does that mean it didn't bother you?
That's fiction.
Did it ever bother you?
After that?
Are they usually like that?
Because I want to know.
Yes.
Tell me about the first time.
Then you went freelance?
They tried to kill you?
Why did you leave the Agency?
Why?
Why not?
The exotic women.
Ahhhh...
But you knew what they were training you for?
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
You went from high school to the Agency?
Why not?
You were like a boy genius?
Jesus -- why?
How old were you?
The C.I.A.?
How did you get into the business?
Where you wanted to be?
Why?
He was killed.
Why didn't you finish this game?
It looks like white's game.
Had?
Better than playing with yourself.
With computers.
This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other?
Why?
If Bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have?
What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.
No.  Just Electra.
Yeah.
Electra.
Listen -- I don't even know your name.
Oh Jesus Jesus...
How?
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
Why?
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
I don't need the money.
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
Forget it!
And you want to use me to get him?
Why?
He wants to kill you?
Why?
So this is something between you and him?
Someone hired both of you?
Who is that other guy?
What does that mean?
An assassin?
You're one of them, aren't you?
Nikita?
You didn't know anything about me.
Okay.  How did you find me?
You want me to pump?
Now what?
Ten million --
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
Bullshit.
Yeah?
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
Where are we going?
Um, five.
What?
A pleasure doing business with you.
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
I thought it was interesting --
I wasn't watching television.
Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
He wants to talk to you.
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.  Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
Landon --
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
That'd be something.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
You sleeping with her?
Were you with Jamie?
A late night or an early morning?
To see your father?
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
You look nice. I should have dressed.
You going to let him? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
You saw him?
I can't know things if you don't tell me.
Out with Belinda?
It could help with a new car --
Your father dropped off an extra check.
About a job.
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
Why not?
What if they expel you?
Yes.
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
Can I -- go out?
It's not that simple.  It costs money to do this at home.
No.  Maybe I believe God has a bigger dream for me than I had for myself.  Maybe I believe the journey, the big adventure, never ends...
It's gone now.
Better. I was really angry.
That was read at my parents' wedding.
Lower. Same page.
Tired.
You know how to waltz??
I'm not going back to school.
That's what I mean.
I don't want to come here anymore.
That I want you to take me home.
I used to like yogurt.
Nothing.
Nope.
Help me live until I die?
All the time.  I feel like I have no one.
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
I should have told you sooner --
The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.  I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
I'm sick.
Pull over.
No.
I'm not applying to college.
Yes, one of many.
Yes. I try to keep my power.
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
From citizen high to citizen low.
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
Sure.
Me.
I'm always home by midnight and he's always asleep.
Ergo?
Are you trying to seduce me?
You planned this --
Mars doesn't rise until 2:30
So what do you want to see?
In my back yard.  I lied before. It's hardly started. But when it's done, it will have twice the power of this one --
It's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one.
I was twelve.
The truth. I just left you out of it.
What would you do up here?
How do you know this place?
Where?
The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
Twice a year.
That. And less strange.
You make me feel...
I might do it wrong.
I don't understand...
Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
I'm sure. Pretty sure.
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
You're acting like a crazy person.
Where?
That what's happening to you, only faster?
Excuse me?
What are you talking about?
We're doing something -- ?
No.
It's only 7:30.
Is there a rush?
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
I'm not allowed to date.
Yes. But not as a date date.
You.
Like fire.
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
I heard what you did. Thank you.
It means you can do anything.
When I have something to say.
It's a start.
And why would that scare me?
You don't know what you want --
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
Prove it.
All of it.
That sounds like horseshit.
People can see.
You're hardly nice to anyone.
Thank you. So were you.
Healthy as can be.
Then maybe you can read mine.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
That would be the reason.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
Oh. Just not at school...
Yes. And?
You don't miss a thing.
The play's going to be really good.
He doesn't trust you.
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
You don't believe in anything?
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
Don't you?
My relationship with God is my own.
In ten words or less?
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
Looking for something -- someone.
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
That is my telescope.
Could be...
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
Do you think I'm strange?
Because I try to be nice to people?
You think so.
I know. Don't say anything.
I'll get something for us to drink --
And you have to meet my father.
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
It's private.
It's like a to-do list, but for my life.
I'll take a chance.
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.
Kinda. Yeah.
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
So you agree you need help?
Like me.
Why?
I know you don't want help.
-- Your act only works with an audience.
-- I know you don't suck at acting.
-- This play means a lot to me.
'Is it really me?'
'They won't.'
Good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person.
Can't you have a normal conversation?
You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
-- I wear the sweater because I'm cold. I read because no one talks to me. My hair is my hair. What is it exactly that's bothering you?
You don't know me.
Because, growing up, books were my world.
I don't make small talk --
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
By making me ill, he is punishing me!  I just don't know what for.
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me!
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
Dad --
I have expectations, too.
It was a play.
No.
Up to?
Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
Fine. But I need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life.
I'm supposed to always be alone?
By accident --
He wants help with his lines --
Does he bite?
What do you feed him?
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
What'd they look like?
Don't you ever get bored around here?
Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?
I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.
You love him?
What's your friend's name?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
Yeah.
I just don't want to go.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
What?
No.
How about over here?
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
It was going too fast.
I'm serious.
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
That's Montana over there.
"Rumor: Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth are in love... Fact: True, but not with each other."
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
I'd like to get out of here.
Yes.
No.
Don't.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
I don't want a steak.
Yeah.
What'd you put him in there for?
I don't know.
Just looking.
Is he upset?
How's he doing?
I found a lid. It was laying on the ground over there.
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
Why?
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
Are you sure?
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
How bad off is he?
Don't call me stupid.
But it would hurt.
What?
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
Is that all there is to it?
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
I don't care.
No.
My stomach's growling.
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
What a nice place.
Okay.
Just don't... I've got a headache.
Yeah, but I don't like it.
I know.
Well, I got homework.
I don't know.
Something mi trabajo.
Spanish.
Great.
Well, stop the world.
Well, I mean there's nothing he wants to know about it... I've got to run.
Nothing.
Yeah.
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
Can I be honest?
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
That's my father. I got to run.
Doing what?
You still in school?
It's okay.
What for?
Holly.
No.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
Believe in Penny Priddy?
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
Go where?  Where're you going?
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
How did she die?  I wanna know.
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
Oh, my.
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
Any time.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
Which?  The one in my throat.
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
It's kinda hard this way.
The girl I remind you of.
Was she pretty?
You.  Like the papers all say.
Go away.  Let me rot?
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
This is so embarrassing...
Better than him.
What's his problem?
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
Barton!
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-
Before what?
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
Well... THIS.
Well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect.  Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. And sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild.  The studio always hated that. Oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited!
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
Oh, he's... he drifted off. He'll sleep for a while now. What is it you have to do, exactly?
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
Hello, Barton.
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
...Who is this?
Hello.
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
Let him go.
...I know this must look... funny.
Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not just Bill's secretary  Bill and I are... I love. We-
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks  well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational
All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
Stop it, Bill!
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
Bill 
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
What?
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
What are you doing here?
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
I got married.  He was on staff at the clinic.  I was down in Salinas.  It didn't... last long.
She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is.  You're a good cop -- what did she do?  Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant?  Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it.
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
I had him in two classes.
I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too.
I slept with her once in school.  I was just a kid.  I was experimenting.  It was just that one time.  She developed a... fixation... on me.  She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did.  It scared me.
She told you, didn't she?
What do you want, Nick?
I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
Yes you do.  Something's on with you.  You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you?
Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
I hardly knew her.  She gave me the creeps, though.  I don't know why.
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.
Yes.  I care about you.  I did it for you.
Sometimes I really hate you.
Nilsen.
No, Nick, please --
It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
I thought you quit.
We were in some of the same classes.
Catherine Tramell.
What was she like?
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
You don't look so okay.
You okay?
Yes.
How's not smoking?
No?
How about the coke?
How about the booze?
How is your -- personal life?
So -- how are things?
I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
How are you, Nick?
I hate rugrats.
What do we do now, Nick?
The games are over.  You were right. It was the fuck of the century, Shooter.
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
I told you.  She kills him.
I finished my book.
Somebody always does.
Somebody has to die.
It won't sell.
What happens to them?
Really.  What are you writing about.
What are you researching?
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
Come over here and tell me no.
Did you miss me?
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
Liar.
You still think I kill people, don't you?
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
Did you?  What's she doing?
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
Of course I knew.
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
Funny.
What did he say?
I'll convince you.
Do you believe me?
Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
About three months before I met you.
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
You won't believe me.
No more games, Nick.  I'm tired of playing games!
No.
I never have before.
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
Make love to me.
Everybody that I care about dies.
Do you think I told her to kill You?
I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
You're in over your head.
You shouldn't play this game.
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
Fine.  How's your back?
Do you want her to join us sometime?
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
Did you think it was so special?
She's seen everything before.
I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
Why take the risk?
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
To see if he can get away with it.
A boy kills his parents.  They have a plane.  He makes it look like an accident.
Aren't you going to thank me?
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"
It's not the same thing, is it?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
What if I call you Nicky?
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
Please.
Fine.
Not me.
Why not?
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.
Do you?
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
Only in theory.  You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not in theory -- in practice.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
There's a name from the past.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
I don't know.  But you do.
I'd like to ask you some, too.
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
No.  Come in.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
You know all about me.
You see?  We're both innocent, Nick.
Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies.  For my writing.
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.
I'm tired.
Thanks.
You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
That's right.
No.
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
I loved him.  I hurt.
I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
Yes it does, doesn't it?
No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
I have nothing to hide.
Did I miss something?
A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
It won't last.
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
Yes, you do.
Do you have a cigarette?
Only when they make interesting reading.
Are you arresting me?
No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
Yes.
Yes.
About a year and a half.
I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
I know who you are.
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
No.
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him.
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
No thank you.
I'm a writer,  I use people for what I write.  You write what you know.  Let the world beware.
In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me.
Cocaine.
Sometimes.
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
It teaches you to lie.
Yes I am.
Why would I need an attorney?
Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
I don't really feel like talking anymore.
Really.  Maybe that's why you're from Homicide.  How?
How did he die?
I really think you should talk to him about this.
You should talk to him about this.
Aren't they?
No.
Who?
Who is it?
You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
I don't believe it, Jean  they're picking straws.
That is amazing. What year is it?
What's that about?
Pretty much the same.
So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but  whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
Don't you think he's using you?
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
What's that?
Hi.
You're your own baby.
You mean babies with you?
It looks done.
Staten Island would be ok.
I hadn't thought about it.
Well thanks!
Basquiat, don't lie.  This is smack.
Basquiat, what did you take?
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
It's Monday morning.
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
What who's saying?
You don't have any fucking money..
I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear?  How could you do that to me?
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
I do.  I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477- 0496.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
You do! You definitely do.
Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.
I think I could do that alone.
Guess I just got sick of him.
No, don't tell me  you just got fired by your crazy boss.
I need this?
I just don't think you're being fair.
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
... What do we do?
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
I don't know anymore, Bruce ...
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
You first.
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
Nor I, on the second.
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
Sure.
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
And the truth frightened her?
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
Yes and no...
"We"?  You and...
Yeah?  Me too...
No darker than yours, Bruce.
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
-- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight.
You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
I heard on TV, "Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds."  How do these hacks <u>sleep</u> at night?
The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
Treat to be here.
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
Oh.  "Kyle."
Pouring myself into my work.
I'm listed.
Well that's a ... long story ...
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
Yes and no ...
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Have we?
Actually I have to split.  Take a "personal day."  You don't mind? Max, you're tops.
Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
Too good?
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
Not good.
I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Make yourself right at home.
OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?
Hold it.  You never said anything about a wife, frozen or otherwise-
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
You're too late.  Say bye-bye birdie.
Love you?  I loathe your bipedal arrogance, your animal superiority. My only joy is knowing that even now my poison kiss is sucking the life from your ape-like face.
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.
One kiss, my love.  For luck.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
How about dangerous curves?
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
At you?  Polly want a kiss?
Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
My life's an open book. You read?
I don't mind the work. Pity I can't see behind the mask.
Now black rubber.
What is it about the wrong kind of man? In grade school it was guys with earrings. College, motorcycles and leather jackets.
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
Last night at the circus. I noticed something about Dent. His coin. He's obsessed with justice. It's his Achilles' heel. It can be exploited.
He's home. I sent the signal.
I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?
What are you talking about?
What?
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
You do know. Try.
What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
Stop fighting.
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
Touchy, touchy.
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
You want me close but you won't let me near. What's the terrible, dark secret you're protecting everyone from?
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
Why do you do that?
What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
Find anything interesting?
And now....
Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?
What?
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
Well, I met someone...
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Like normal folks.
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
Excuse me.
Would you? I'm not so sure.
That's usually my line.
You understand obsession better than you let on.
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
What do you know about obsession?
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
Exactly.
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
You're right, Edward. I didn't mean to be impolite. Please.
Who is The Batman, Edward?
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Edward...
Chase?
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
What is that?
I loathe bats.
How'd you find this place?
It doesn't protect your head, though.
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that?
... How long have I been out?
... Where are you taking me?
How do I know you won't keep them all?
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
I won't let you have it.
I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
Well -- I think you might consider
... A hundred and eight?
Can't we --
What about the girl?
Shouldn't we --
Look! Police!
WHICH CAR?
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
What now?
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
... Where are you calling from?
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
I wish you'd...
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
All street mimes should be executed.
Mm-hmm.  Lunch.  Not even dinner.
To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
... We could try that.
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
... Terror.
Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
Do you sail?
As far as I know.
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
... Why the mask?
I've seen worse.  Much worse.
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
And you want a --
... Thank you.
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
You okay?
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
Yeah. Deja vu.
It's gone.
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
He's not crazy.
Allie, he's not.
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Alexander... I know you.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
Are they paying you for all this?
You are on drugs.
Oh, Bruce...
His face.  Allie, look at his face.
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Peanuts?
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Yum, yum.
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
No.
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Burned out.  I need a vacation.
How'd you know it was me?
He's not too bad.  I can live with him.
No, I'm fine.
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
About Charles...
Let's get a coffee.
Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?
0 my god.
At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.
Honestly David, you're so spineless.
Meaning?
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
Hi.....  Roses.
Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God-awful.  Why do you wear it?
David, I'm serious!
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
Your face smells like a foot.
Liar.
There were three strawberries.
Go ahead.
I need some time, David.  A little time.  It's not just you.  It's partly me.
It isn't working any more, David.
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
Did you really ask?
Scottish.
It's the last thing we need.
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
Do we know anything about him?
And what did you say?
There aren't hotels?
Yeeees?
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
3:30 I guess.
Just a hunch.
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
You can build another one... with her.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here.  You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers.  If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...
<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?
He might have hurt somebody.
Who did the sushi?
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
No, we don't.  We can work something out ourselves.  We just have to try harder.
Honey.  Let's go.
She's only fourteen...
Maybe we should knock first?
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
Bet... el... geuse.  What an awful name.  I thought it was like -- you know.  The <u>juice</u> of <u>beetles</u>.
What happened?
<u>Betelgeuse</u>!
... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
Here's something.
Then it should be here.
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
You know you're really a pretty girl.
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
I feel really stupid.
God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?
That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh, Adam.
We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
Draw door?  I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
That little girl saw us.
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
Death didn't improve your sense of humor.
We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
No, I'm not putting up with this.
We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
At least we won't have to worry about her.
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
What's she doing here?
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
I don't think we survived the crash.
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
That's how long you were gone.
Two hours.
Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood.
I am sitting.
I'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
Oh... I'm sorry...
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
Adam!
Wave at the lion.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
Oh no.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Oh puh-leeze!
So can I?
I got an A!
I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
Really.  I don't know.
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you?  My father bought this place.  He never walks away from equity.  Why don't <u>you</u> leave?
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.
Is this like a trick question?
<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
Home.  <u>Home</u>.  <u>Home</u>!
Just one daughter.
Just get some people out of our house.
We're...
What about Betelgeuse?
About what?
Our cemetery?
What do you mean?  What's he do?
If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
No.
Yes.
We're very unhappy.
We need help.  We deserve help.
Are you Juno, our case worker?
It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
How'd you do on the science test?
Step... mother.
So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
Life is just... too awful.
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
I want to be dead too.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
No, wait!
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
Tell the truth.
We're practicing.
You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.
'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
And live in what, our station wagon?
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
Your qu...?  But you're...
W... What is it?
... I will.
You've got to help them.
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
God, you're anatomically correct!
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
Beetle!
I don't know what that signal means.
Your fingers are so small I can't see them.  First word -- two syllables.
Three syllables.
Yes.
I... I don't know what your name is.
Yeah.
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
I think so.
I want to get in.
Are you a spirit too?
Where'd they go?
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
Not these people!  They are ruthless!
I think she's in with them.
Just don't tell Lydia.
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Otho'll know what to do.
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
It's <u>Otho</u>!
They're... not here anymore.
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
I cannot believe this.
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?
They're ghosts.  They do what they want.
<u>This is not a joke</u>!  That sheet was full of ghosts.
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
Stepmother's...
Dad.  Do you believe me?
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
I'm lonely.
Stepmother.
I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
Delia hates it.
I'm sorry already.
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
It doesn't matter.  What matters is I've got a roomful of guests down there, who think I'm a fraud.  I am going to teach you something here Lydia.  You've <u>got</u> to take the right tone in things like this, or people -- whether they're dead or alive -- people will walk all <u>over</u> you.  Come on out, or I will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never <u>lived</u>!
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
Tried to convince me that this house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids. Kids!  I love them.
It wasn't a joke.
Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
I saw some ghosts.
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.
Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!  It doesn't matter what brand.
Any particular kind?
<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
I say let's keep it the way it is.
We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
What's happening to them?
Are they still here, Otho?
Look at the tiny figures.
It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
Maybe Charles does.
Attic space.
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
<u>Oh my God</u>!
Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!
Viridian?  What is...?
What do you think?
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
Okay?
What's wrong?
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
Is this the key to the attic?
What happened to the people who used to live here?
<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
Their wedding clothes.
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
The attic.
They don't want to come down.
Otho, that's terrible.
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things...
No more, Robert... No more needles...
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.
Of course! By kid-lawyers!
I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
I wish he were here...
... Do you think we should look for him?
Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
... But he's...?
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
Stay here? Is that necessary?
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
Chauncey! Chauncey!
Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
... But I've never done...  ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...?
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
To watch...? To watch me...?
I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
I feel so close to you, so safe with you, Chauncey...  ... And Benjamin understands that, dearest... He understands and accepts my feelings for you...
It must be the punch, and it is stuffy in here -- I feel it a little myself. You're an angel, my dear - thank God there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
... I guess I may as well be honest about my feelings, Chauncey, as I know you are I am in love with you... I love you and I want you... And I know that you know it and I'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... Until...
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
... Good night, Chauncey.
... I have very few friends, Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older...
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
I know you do - you and your television...  ... Good luck, Chauncey.
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
Chauncey...
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ...
Yes, so do we.
Our greenhouse.
Of course.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get to see him.
Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?
Your leg must be getting better.
Chauncey!
... Good night, Chauncey.
... Why... No, I don't think so...
He does...?
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
I admire that in a person. As for myself, I find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times...
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...
Did you lose something?
Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
May I ask your name?
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
Oh? Certainly...
Would you care for a drink?
Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you...  David, we'll just go on home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know?
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
I hope you're comfortable.
Why, there certainly is. You must see a doctor, I insist on it. Please, let us take you.
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
... I've worked very hard and enjoyed my life... I've known success... and I've felt love... My associates, Chauncey - I've talked with them about you... They're eager to meet you... very eager to meet you... I'm very fond of you, Chauncey... And I understand Eve... Tell her that... tell her I'm madly in love with her...
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
... Chauncey... Chauncey...
Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you must excuse me - I'm very tired all of a sudden.
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
... Maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position, Chauncey... Maybe one day...
Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?
Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for God's sake don't give up on yourself! You have to fight! You can't let those bastards keep you down! I don't want to hear any more from you about the 'Room Upstairs'. That's where I'm going soon.
Bravo!
A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent! Isn't that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard.
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
And I'm Ben.
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
... So am I, my boy - so am I.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
You're gonna need somebody, someone's gotta be around for you, boy...  ... You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance...  But I guess it oughta be an old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good, not with that little thing of yours...  ... You're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you?  ... Goodbye, Chance...
... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'...  ... gotta go now, Chance...
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
Well, ain't that the truth...
Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook?  That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
... Evening, Chance.
... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
... Ben, really...
That's good... That's good.
... Yes, I am, Ben.
I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached...  ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.
Do you need a secretary?
Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?
Do you feel well enough for that?
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
You heard?
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
No headaches?
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.
Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
Good evening, Wilson.
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Hello, Sophie.
You take care too, Bobby.
You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
I'm afraid so.
... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
Yes, I did.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help.  Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly.
I know.
People make mistakes.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
A better friend.
The monkey.
It's Elijah.
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
My God!
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
I need a shower.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
You fell in love with her first.
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
What's that?
It'll never happen, fuckface.
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
You bastard.
Suck my dick!
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
Me and John.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
Yes.
Fuck Maxine.
Us, of course.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
You've always hated the animals.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
What are you doing?
Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. Well smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
Don't crowd me, Craig.
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
I have to go back now.
I have to go back.
I'm scared.
Now?
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
I want to try.
Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.
'kay.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
The iguana.
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
I was worried.
Did you eat?
Hi.
She's very beautiful.
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Seven-ish
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Why, Craig. why?
Why'd you do it, Craig?
Is the trial date set?
The monkey.
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
Let him try.
Lotte? Is that you?
Lotte, this is so good...
A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
I've fallen in love.
You're late.
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
I'll protect you, Dollface.
Sure. It'd be fun.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
What's he been in?
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
It better be.
No.
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
Yikes.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
You're a fag or a liar.
Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
My tits?
The usual, Barry.
You married?
Just.
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Somebody told you.
Who told you?
Who told you?
Why not?
Yeah.
What?
You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
Yes, well...
I wouldn't know.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
Hush, sweetheart.
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
Two hundred dollars, please.
You can be John Malkovich.
No. Don't be an ass.
No.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
Why not? I need to get in there!
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
You bastard!
No.
No, I didn't know that.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
I blew it, Dr. Lester.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
I'm getting divorced.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
One hour.
We have to meet.
Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers.
I have to see you.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
Maxine...
I love you, Lotte.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
When?
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
Yes?
After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it.  Psychotherapy.
Ah.
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
Let her go, Craig. I mean him."
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
Yes, Hi.
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?
Whatever.
Yeah what?!
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
You've got to be kidding.
Bad dream, darling?
Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
Vegas.
It's okay, my sweet.
Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!
No one would ever have to know its not him.
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
Stay in him forever?
You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
I'd love to see your work.
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
You still there, sweets?
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
Lotte called me.
Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Darling!
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Oh, Lotte...
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Do you mind?
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
Thanks so much for coming over.
Whatever you're having.
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
Mr. Malkovich?
Know it, and go on out the yard. Go on.
Then what do I do?
There ain't.
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
You got to go sometime. You got to go out there by yourself sometime.
There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.
No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
Was a time I knew what was.
Not like He punished me.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
No, Stamp. I ain't.
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
I likes yellow.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
That's the last thing they took from me.
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
Well what?
I got a delivery around here. Name of Tucker.
Folks come. Folks go.
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
Those boys didn't even know him. You had six whole years of marriage to my Halle Fathered every one of your children. A blessing. I learned hard that a man's just a man, but a son like that...like Halle..now that's somebody.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.
Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
You best leave that quilt alone. That was grandma's quilt.
THE WHITEFOLK?
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
I WILL PROTECT YOU.
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Thank you.
Yes sir
I don't. I have my own.
At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her.
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
Yes?
I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me.
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
Don't pay to complain.
Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?
They good whitefolks?
In case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad I can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. Anything.  Don't ask me what whitefolks need at night.
In case of what?
Be here. In case.
Fine. But what would I do at night?
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
Ya think?
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
I miss her.
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
Yes ma'am.
You know what? I've been here since I was fourteen and I remember like yesterday when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. Whiteman name of Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin were good friends. That's how she got that house you all live in. Other things too.
Well, come on in. You letting in flies.
Yes ma'am..
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Yes ma'am.
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
What you want'em for?
Oh.
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
What you want?
May I come in?
Yes?
No..No that won't do...
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
No. I mean work work.
I want to work, Miss Lady.
Mama?
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.
Mama let me help you.
But mama..
MAMA!
Morning, ma'am.
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
Won't you be late for work?
She likes to see you off in the morning.
Should I wake her?
That was fun.
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
You know as well as I do, Stamp, that people who die bad don't stay in the ground.
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
And he left when he found out what Sethe did?  What you say casts a different light on it, I guess...I thought-
He knew Baby Suggs?
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
You?
What run him off? Tell me that!
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
Till she showed herself.
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.
Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people.
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
Her who?
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
I don't know him that well.
He ask, I give him anything.
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
He's sleeping in the church.
Better ask Paul D.
Might see anything at all at 124.
You sure?
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
Out where?
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
What?
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
I want a child.
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
Jeffrey--
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
Finder's fee?
What happened to your house?
What do you do for fun?
Uh-huh.
Oh?
Mmnun.
Uh-huh.
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
Jeffrey.
I want you to see him immediately.
Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects.
Do you still have that doctor's number?
So Dieter has the money?
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.
Dieter has been on the fringes of-- well, of everything in L.A., for about twenty years.  Look at my LP's. Under 'Autobahn.'
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Dieter Hauff?
From who?
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
And please don't call her my mother.
She most certainly was not!
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a good man, and thorough.
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive
Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
Take a look at this, sir.
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
You're not interested in sex?
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
Thank you.
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
I want to see the sun rise.
How does it look?
I don't understand.
You're hurting me.
Well it's in mine, too.  I'm a pureblood.  I wasn't turned.  I was born this way.  Just like you.  Am I evil because I want to survive?  What about a wolf?  What about any predator?
Why do you hate us so much?
If that's true, then why'd you save me?
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
Why?
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
Thank you.
Anyone else make it?
"Each day is a little life.  Every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death."
Each day is a little life.
Blade.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
Really?  What are we supposed to do, then?  Starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live?  What about that scumbag you just let off the hook? A nothing.  A drug-dealer.  How do you justify saving people like that?
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
Exactly.  Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified.  Super charged.  And this --
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Minutes.
I didn't know.
What about Nomak?
You're hurt.
What was that?
We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.
The House of Pain.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
No.  They've been training to hunt you.
Two years.
You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
Survival.
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
Maybe it's better that way.
We're locked in.
You experimented on your own, son?
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
His name is Jared Nomak.
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
I know. Take some of my blood.
I'm not leaving without you.
It won't work on you.
Is it bad?
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
Are you all right?
You make it sound like I'm already dead.
I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
Some. It's been slow --
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
You care about him, don't you?
Is he sick?
I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
Blade --
If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
It's dark in here.
What am I injecting you with?
You're hurt --
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
What is this place?
Like what?
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
How can you tell?
You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
I know this place -- it's a blood bank.
Graffiti --
What are you looking at?
You don't know that.
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
What are you doing?!
And that's a good thing?
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
But he's a policeman --
But, he could've --
You used me as bait?!
How did you know?
That's ridiculous! No one's that powerful.
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
What happens then?
Why?
You're joking --
I'm sorry, I --
-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
Sometimes --
What?
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
I don't know --  Look at this blood smear --
This isn't human blood.
Get away from him!
Blade --
You're a monster.
But you use blood banks --
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
You.
LaMagra --
What happens then?
How many of you are there?
What happened to the power?
On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia.
Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia?
All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
I'll take my chances.
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
How did you escape?
He killed them?
Why do you hunt them?
No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
Whistler!
You've been listening in the whole time?
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
So what do you use, then? A stake?
Who are you people?
What -- ?
Nick!!
Bullshit! Talk!
Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.
--my God, Nick???
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
Closer.
No.
Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
Not that I can see.
My eye, is there something in my eye?
What, are you alright?
--Anna--
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
What happened to her, where did she go?
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
What do you mean?
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
Try, please, Anna--
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.
Join the club.
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
Because it means the tree is older than the house.
Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?
Hey, folklore--
--or incredibly fucking naive.
--which she may have--
--and if she ever did--
I just wanna go <u>home</u>.
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
Inside the grave?
What're you doing there?
Domini?
--he's not my husband!
--I'm not staying here!
No!
I guess--
Something was wrong.
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
Why?
--Nick!!
I haven't killed any--
Looks like business is booming.
That's a joke?
We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
Oh, sorry, right.
Not the only things missing, Nick.
So whoever built this--
No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
The Witch's voice.
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
Guess they thought it was safe to put some up again.
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
--Christ almighty--
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
--what're you saying?? I didn't have anything to do with--
Why?
--no, what's wrong with you?
Whatever you want.
--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
I can't.
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
No.
What?
I guess, yeah.
Nothing. I dunno--
Sleep.
--Cotter's--
Get your goddamn--
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
For once could you just sit down, shut up, and give something a <u>chance</u>?
We've looked at half of one tape.
No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
I want to see the tapes.
--or someone--
Yes.
I don't know. Nightmare.
I don't know.
What?
--fine, later, fine.
You feel no need to get married or anything.
Why is there no "our" here?
You don't want it though.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
What is <u>this</u>?
You sure?
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--
What?
She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
It's like traveling back in time.
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
Doesn't say--it's just these pages.
--it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--
--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
Who?
Goes right along with these two.
That's a "j."
--one of us, all of us--I have no idea--brought whatever this thing is back here. We're not going to go out there and spread it around like Typhoid Mary. We're gonna figure it out, we're gonna bring a goddamn <u>end</u> to it.
Nobody's going anywhere--
--before you lose your emotional lunch.
<u>What</u>--
--Domini!
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
--I saw what I saw.
What the fuck--??
It's <u>freezing</u>.
How's she going to know where to--
Where?
Boy Kurth.
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
Cotter?
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
Fire escape??
Where's Domini?
Gimme it!
Where <u>is</u> it?
Still don't see it--
English.
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
Too busy eating us?
--Cotter: shut up.
What about night?
Me, too.
--yeah, a hand or something--
Get <u>out</u> of here!
What're you, crazy??
We should be so lucky.
Try a long walk.
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
No fucking.
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
What I never could figure about the movie?
What movies?
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
Never would've guessed.
Nice tent.
You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.
Shut-up.
I take it back--she <u>wasn't</u> an actor. She's a nutjob.
I do.
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?
--which'd be about ten bucks--
--fuckin' A right--
What're you afraid's going to happen?
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
You gonna be alright?
I know, I know--
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
What?
What?
....I don't know.
Dad...?
Elly Kedward?
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide.
Two-to-one he dusts the keyboard for fingerprints the second he gets back.
Cotter'll kill you.
For a blur?
What'd you see?
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
What's that?
Women miscarry all the--
And what's your excuse for being here?
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
--the marks appear, then you disappear. Like the little Kurth boy, like Domini, as soon as they come to full bloom--and mine <u>are</u>!
Does she, goddamnit??
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
Not this one.
"It's why the witch kills children."
--fuck Anna!
No. We <u>all</u> go.
You're needed here--keep watching--
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
You <u>know</u> what we picked up in the woods--
Put 'em together that's a "k." James Kurth--
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
I can't do it!
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
We are being fucked with here, someone or something.
Spare me.
What?
That feels good. Lower--down into my neck.
--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
Shoot.
Yeah.
--a <u>lot</u>.
I'm sorry.
She's off her fucking rocker--
Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
Whatever--all I know is the persecution's going to start all over again, they keep pumping out inflammatory bullshit like this fucking movie--
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
--she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
--the Sheriff's Office--
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.
--it's urgent!
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
No.
Yes.
What happened to my Dad??
Who <u>is</u> this??
Meurice--
Sort of...
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
No, I--
I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in?
Thanks, Meurice.
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
...So?
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
You broke into the bar. You wanted to get your money. You and Marty had a fight. Something happened...
...But first I gotta know what happened.
...You leaving?
...Where is everything?
...What's going on with you two?
Marty.
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What the hell happened, Ray?
Ray--
Well... what happened?
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
...What do you mean?
...You called me this morning.
Yeah...
Why didn't you get into bed?
...What?
...Ray?
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...You all right?
Ray?... What time is it?
Hello?
Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.
When you don't they're usually nice.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll tell you that much.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
I couldn't believe it either...
Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me...
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
I could've sworn I heard something.
...Well, I'd be okay in here--
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
Well... the couch would be all right...
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.
You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here?
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
What?
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
Where... where you going?
...Drive me to a motel?
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
What was that?
...Ray?
Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. come on. He didn't mean it.
If you want to.
Those are my breasts.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Yes, but.
Frank?
Where are we going, Frank?
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
. mommy's here.
Hello, daddy.
Hello, baby.
No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Oh he forced you, huh?
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Alright, suit yourself.
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Hold me, Don.
Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
They hurt his head.
My secret lover.
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Oh God, Jeffrey. is that you? Oh God.
No.  Hi baby.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
I want you to stay with me.
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
I did. are you?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
I love you Don with all my heart.
Just get outta my bed.
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
I asked first.
Do you love me?
Kiss me.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Beeeee careful.
Does that scare you?
Frank would open you.
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
You like to open me. don't you?
I want you to hurt me.
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
Are you a bad boy?
What do you want to do?
Do you like my body?
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
Yes. Frank-
It used to make me laugh .but.
Come in.
Please. please stay.
. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Don?. Are you in with them?
Falling.
Look.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Who's it, you mean.
I'm alright. go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
Oh shit.
I liked being with you last night.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
Yeah. hurry up though.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
You don't?
Do you know?
I made it go down the toilet.
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
Do you like me?
You can hit me, if you want to.
You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
See my nipples?
See my breasts?  . See?
Do you like the way I feel?
Thank you. honey.
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
Don?
Sure I'm alright.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Lie down on the bed.
Do you like talk like that?
Do you like that?
What do you want?
What do you want from me?
No way.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
THEN WHAT?
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
Shit. You better tell me something.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Yeah.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Yes? What is it?
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
Que va hacer?
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
Surprise.
Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
Are you kidding?
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
You happy, baby?
What is?
Derek!
You'll see for yourself.
You happy, baby?
What is?
Derek!
You'll see for yourself.
Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
You can't sell this to your friends.
It's garbage.
Tuna, this is crap.
Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
You can't sell this to your friends.
It's garbage.
Tuna, this is crap.
Better than you.
George, he wasn't asking.
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Kristina's fine.
Hey, George.  You okay?
She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.
Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
What do you want?
Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say something like that.  Always thinking about yourself.
You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.
That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me.
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer the question.  What do I spend?  What? How will we live?
What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!
Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down for once.  It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid.
Out.
Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
I said, I've seen it before.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
She did that before.
Pablo said no?
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire.
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
Why are you smiling?
I don't think so.
Hello.
I know, Dad.  I love you too.
Shhhh.
I know, Dad.  I know...
It's alright, Dad.
Swear on my life.
I don't believe you.
You swear?
But I've got school.
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
You swear?
Where are you going?
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
California.
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
Yeah.
You mean, like a trip?
Do what you want, it's a free country.
What do you want from me?
I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.
What?
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
Well, here I am.  See?
What are you doing here?
Are we gonna split up?
What's happening to us?
That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
No.
No.  I haven't done it in years.
I have.
Yes.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Yes.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Yes.
No -- never.
Six years.
No -- but I can get it for you.
Rebecca Lawson.
I assume his girlfriend.
I had some papers to pick up.
A little after eleven.
Because he called me.
No.
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
Yes.
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
No.
I don't know.
P.M.
Three fifteen.
Dristan nasal spray.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
I've been to a few -- yes.
I've tried it.
I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest.  As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.
I was jealous.  Of course I was hurt. He switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with.  But I didn't kill him.
Yes.
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
That bastard!
Who told you that?
Yes.  I suppose it's possible.
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
I suppose.
Yes -- he mentioned it.
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
I was at the house one morning -- I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial.
Yes -- cocaine.
No.
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
He did.  Look, I know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink -- but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough  -- and well...
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
Don't listen to him.  Can't you see he's trying to turn you against me.
No -- he's lying.
Shoot him.
Don't push me, Frank.  I might lose my temper and send it out just for spite.
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.
That's crazy.
Frank -- It's Rebecca.  I need to see you right away.  I've got the tape.
No -- I'm a survivor.
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
No -- you're not.
I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
You're too weak, Frank.  When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.  If something gets in your way you remove it.
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
Are you scared?
Tonight we open new doors.
Sugar or honey?
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
Something wrong?
You can see me now.
You were brilliant today.
Of course.
I went out on the boat.
I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
She's mistaken.
What?
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.
No -- that's what I know you were thinking.
You and me -- making love.
Yes -- it would be nice.
It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it?  To let go of what you want?
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
Really?
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
It won't be that hard.
I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
Sorry.
Andrew loved this old cabin.  He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum.  I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it.
No -- not at the office.  I've got a better idea.
Yes -- she did.
Hi, Frank.
Hello?
Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
Tastes can change.
That's not an answer.
I'm the photographer.
What do you think?
Is it against the law?
Why not?
I know.
Can we get out of here?
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
I was at a cocktail party.  Very trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on business.  He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  He looked so helpless.
Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
Yes.
I thought the subject was sex?
Something like that.
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.
I am who I am.  I can't deny it, anymore than you can deny who you are.  I like sex different -- I like it wild.  That's not a crime.  I loved Andrew.  We made love together.  We made it differently, but we still made love.  It was our way.  It was private -- and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice.  If I was some middle-aged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me?
I'm used to being on the outside looking in.  The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
Frank!
He'll file.  He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
Do you think I did it?
Are you going to represent me?
Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!
I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
It was a place to start.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
Why didn't you come to me?
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
Talk to me.
Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
It's bad enough that you are.  It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to turn this around on me.
Why did you lie to me?
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
Where have you been?
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
We have to talk.
Is that alright, Frank?
No one's asking you not to work.  I just think you could make some time for your son.
Why don't you talk to him now?
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
Yes.
She sounds like quite a woman.
What's she like?
If he files are you going to take the case?
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
I swear -- the both of you.  Some example you set.
He could let you have your vacation.
We're supposed to go to the lake.
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
If you want me to.
Really.
This is not relaxing.
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!
Don't use language like that at the dinner table.
Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
That's too bad.
It didn't get there from me.
No -- never.
Six thirty -- and he was very much alive.
Yes.
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Well, I can help.
I don't mind waiting.
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
My Jewish friend's grandmother did.
I simply can not stand that tone!
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
Well, that's a long time.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
No. You can have them.
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
Aw, Betty.
I do not need instructions from you to bathe!  I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come!  Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
No.
No treasure maps, huh?
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
How bizarre!
I know. I don't understand it either.
Eeeww!
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
You're right -- that is sick.
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
Did we want to?
Was this during Betty?
I never knew that.
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
Yeah. But I thought she died.
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
STOP IT!  I want to read them! If you don't want to, then just leave. But don't you push me around like I'm some mule you paid for -- I already GOT A HUSBAND!
Well, I'd like to read them.
What are you doing?
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose.  But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
No, I don't think so. I --
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
Don't say that!
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
'82.
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested...
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
Come here a minute.
Michael.
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
Well, there's a problem.
He's not coming.
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
Mom's orders.
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
Madge?
Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to.
No. Don't do this.
I don't know. Please...
I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand -- we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you.
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
What makes it different, Robert?
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
WHY?
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
No one's asking you to!
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
Well, what is this?
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it?
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Sleep all right?
No.
Long day. Go to sleep.
Where was she?
You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
What?
What were your parents like?
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
What were you like when you were younger?
But you don't mind.
Why do you say that?
I bet you could do a book.
On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.
I sat there once. It was hot. Like today. I'd been shopping. I had all these bags around my feet I kept having to move every time the waiter came by...
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yes.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Yes.
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
Take me somewhere.
Are you hungry?
No. I can't. Not yet.
Yes, that'd be nice.
Sure.
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
I want you to come.
I understand.  That's very kind of you.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
Oh.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
Yeah. See you later.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
Oh, sure. Great.
Wonderful. Uh...
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
No. I was just... No.
Yes! Hi.
... I feel like something's been spoiled now.
Listen, I'm sorry I --
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
What made you ask such a question?
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
No, I'm just saying --
But it's not the same.
But no one in particular.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
Do you ever regret not having a family?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
Why doesn't it scare you?
You really don't need anyone?
Woman friends, too?
You must get lonely at times.
So what happened?
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
What?
Yes.
What?
No. I'll do them later.
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
What?
No. I'm all right. It's working.
When?
Smells like dirt.
You drink bug repellent?
Well, it's kind of buggy out there.
My God. How I'd love to see that.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
I don't think you're normal.
You sound like an artist.
Why, do you think?
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
You ought to write these stories down.
Oh you!
Then what happened?
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
What?
Okay.
Help cook?
Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
But I... We don't even know each other.
I feel so embarrassed.
I think so.
Much.
Yes. Very clean.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
He's very... clean.
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
Why?
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
About a year and a half.
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
And how long are you here for?
Where are you staying while you're here?
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
Not at all.
Lemon?
Francesca.
Sure.
Oh, that's nice.
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
Oh there you are.
This time of year.
I don't mind waiting.
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
No, really?
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
Oh.
Oh. When did you move back?
Are you from Washington originally?
Maybe it's because I live here.
No.
Hmm-mmm.
No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.  I just have to get my shoes.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
Roseman Bridge?
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
Yes. And I've accepted.
Hmm?
Okay.
Want anything special for dinner?
It's only four days.
I'm positive.
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
I can't sleep.
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
Later. Go back to sleep.
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
What's she like?
What's her name?
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Yes, they are.
About an hour ago.
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
What happened?
I don't.
Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.
It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
I know damn well she's there.
Outta my way, boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm coming!
Some holes can't be filled.  Some hungers can't be satisfied.
Don't feed that dog.
But.
Where are we, baby?
What?
Jimmy, you've got --
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
Let me see your hand.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
My God.  My dress.  We have to find it. And burn it.  And shut the door.
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
Girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out.
We'll have to sneak in.
Fine.  Maybe I got nothing to lose. 'Cept you.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
Your father.  He was your father.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
It's alright, baby.
Please.  It's for your own good.
I lied.
...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.
Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse.
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
Aren't you going to join us?
Should I?
That building?
No thanks.
I'm not joking boy.  Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier.
Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy Bones is gonna be around a long time.
The blood is still there.  We just gotta figure out where.
... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
You're pretty black to be growing up in Rossmore Park.
You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?
Caesar, you don't know shit.
Caesar, don't.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
I should have let him kill you.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
Now you listen to me, asshole, I know your gun is behind the bar ...
But everybody is all right.
We were in a car accident --
Good boy.
You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
You murdered Gino!
Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business.
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
Everything you couldn't.
Let us go and we'll make a deal.
You need the money just like we do.
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Not until he has the money!
He can't kill you --
Don't tell him --
Just hurry.
Who are you going to call?
What are you doing?
I don't know.  it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please, Caesar, we don't have much time.  Let's get out of here.
It's not here, Caesar.
Caesar, someone could see us out here.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
What happened to them?
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
What?
Caesar, what are you going to do?
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
Caesar ...
You don't, you can't believe that ...
Caesar, this is crazy.
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
The hell I can't!
This is insane!
No.
But it could be anywhere.
The money?  The money's gone.
All right, Caesar.
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
Caesar, maybe we should run --
Caesar, what are we going to do?
But you know he did it.
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
It was him.  I'm positive.
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.
That doesn't make any sense.
You mean they weren't up here?
They just left, didn't they?
They were early.
Don't be silly, Caesar.  It'll take five minutes.
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
What are you going to do with it?
Caesar, what happened?
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.
Caesar, I'm leaving.
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
Jesus, Caesar!
She's doing the work herself.
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
I didn't expect --
All part of the business.
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
I could be lying.
You can't kill me yet.
No.
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
Lick me.
Sure.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
I should be going.
Five.
No.  Rajeev's in India.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
...  thank you.
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
All right.
How do I know you are cops?
Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
Hello?
...  Me neither.
No.
You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
I'm here, aren't I?
How'd it go?
Hey.
Hey.
Don't be sorry.  Help me.
I'm sorry, Corky ...
You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
I was so afraid you ...
I'm still here.
Oh, thank God.
We're almost there, Violet.  just hang on.
okay, all right.
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
What if he doesn't run?
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
He totally freaked.  I've never seen him like this.  He's out of his fucking mind.
What happened?
It's me.
I think we're going to find out.
I won't.
I had a partner and she fucked me.
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
Thank you.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
You'll be clean and we'll be rich.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
He'll have to run.
C!  Shit, I'm sorry!
If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.
Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
Why?
Not Caesar.
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.
The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch.  Trust.
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
There is no going back.
If he does ...
I'm just asking, what if?
Trust me, Violet.
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
He won't.
What if he sees you?
Shit!  Oh shit!
An accident.
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
Where will you be?
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
Fine.
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
Any bodyguards?
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
What time did you say they would be there?
Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
What did Gino drink?
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
He does it right in front of him.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Does Johnnie hit on you?
Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
What happened?
Yeah, twice.
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
Sweet Jesus.
Yeah.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Yeah.
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
...  shit.
That's his brother.
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
Gino Marzzone.
Who is Gino?
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Why?
Like each other?  They hate each other.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Johnnie?
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
Good.
Yes.
Does the case lock?
It's in a case, on his desk.
In his office.  I saw it this morning.
And where is it now?
To let it dry.
What?
He hung it up.
Then what?  Exactly.
Yeah.
You said he washed the money?
I think ...
Do you think you know me like that?
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
I'm just making a point.  You have no idea what you're asking.  How much trust two people need to do something like this.
Is that what you think?
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
I didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are.  It would have been easy to set Shelly up.  You could have got him killed knowing that Caesar would bring the money to the apartment.
You think I'm lying?
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
I am, but ...
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly.  They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  You fuck them, you've got to do it right.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
Shelly said it was over two million dollars.
How much money?
Caesar is going to get the money and bring --
If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register?
What choice?
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
For what?
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
He's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be. |But Mickey doesn't like it like they do.  I suppose that's why he's good at it.
Mickey?
Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
Maybe he did.  He would brag to me all the time.  He was never afraid of Caesar because he didn't know him.  Not like I do.
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar.  He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
That's what he told himself.  But it wasn't even about me, it was about Caesar.  He wanted what Caesar had. That's how they are.  I understand them.
He was in love with you, right?
Yes.
Even though he knew about you?
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
I think so, too.
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
I suppose he just wants to watch.
No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
You mean Shelly?
What about that guy this morning?
We make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  I think we're more alike than you want to admit.
Work.
What was it then?
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
What the fuck was it?
What you heard wasn't sex.
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
I don't.
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
Is that what her daddy tells her?
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
Because it's the truth.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
We're not that different, Corky.
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
I don't understand - ?
I'm not afraid of anything.
What are you afraid of?
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
Shit, here we go.
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
Nothing.
What's wrong?
So am I.
I'm glad you did.
I guess I wanted to.
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
My cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught.  She was always more honest than me.
I'm already in your bed.
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
The redistribution of wealth?
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
What?
The redistribution of wealth.
Yes, it is.
Five years is a long time.
Almost five years.
How long have you been with him?
Basically.
He's a launderer?
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
How did you meet him?
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
No.
You have to ask?
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
Tell me about it.
...  I needed that.
Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
I wanted to apologize.
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
I had to see you.
...  yes.
No.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
Because I want to.  I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.
Why?
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.
I have a tattoo, would you like to see it?
Maybe.
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
Curious, maybe.
No.
You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous, Corky?
A beer.  Of course.
A beer?
What do you want?
Okay, one drink.
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --
Sure.
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
Yeah, come on in.
He said you lost something.
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
Not exactly.
Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance.
My pleasure.
Thanks.
I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.
Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
Caesar is your husband?
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
Do you know him?
Oh, really.
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
I knew it.
'63 Chevy.
Truck.  Of course.
Truck.
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
Yeah.
You're doing everything yourself?
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
Are they really?
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
Oh, I'm sorry --
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
A favor?
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
Good guess.
I guessed you were straight black.
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
So this is temporary for you?
Oh, he went home to India, but as far as I know he'll be back.
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
Who?
I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator --
Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get out, you know?  Get away from all of this.
I know you will.
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
Mickey?  What are you doing here?
Oh, God.
Caesar wants me to stay.
You have ID?
Yes.
Can I help you?
What about you?
What was I thinking, right?
And that's it?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
Who is it?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
What?
xxxxxx
Yes.  That's who I want to be.
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
What is that?
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
It's a company... MPG Capital.
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
-- we'll tell them what happened --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
-- we'll explain it --
But the police --
Oh, Jesus...
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
I trusted you.
You knew he was coming.
He came to kill us.
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
He's dead isn't he?
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
...omigod, no...
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
You got me pretty fucking curious.
Anytime.
Okay, so...
Jason...
I should go.
So this is it, right?
Where?
Looks familiar?
That's it?  Is that it?
You ever think maybe you have a family?
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
We're about an hour away.
I needed a break.
You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
Okay, so you're a victim.
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
What are you talking about?
-- you could put it together --
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?

Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
What?  Like amnesia?
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
What does that mean?
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
What if I say no?
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is --
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy --
You have blood on your pants.
For twenty thousand dollars.
So what's in Paris?
Jesus...
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
Get the fuck away from my car.
It's a little late for that.
Oh, Jesus...

xxxxxx
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! --
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
Well don't. You're looking at twenty pounds of high explosive! And if you don't stamp this form I'm going to blow the place up!
I bet you'd like to touch them?
You think these are tits don't you?
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
Where do I get it stamped?
Stamped?
Yes.
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
What do you think? ... is it me?
Take care.
Don't do anything silly.
Where are you going?
Don't you like parties?
Yes.
They're gone.
Your face ... are you hurt?
Yes.
No you're not!
Oh ... Jesus!
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
Leave me alone!
Go away.
Are you still following me?
Yes.  Come out, I know you're in there
What?
Shit! The house is on fire!
We? Don't blame me!
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
Let go! We've got to stop!
Stop it ... damn you!
Get away!
Cut it out, Sam.
I thought you arrested me.
You're joking.
Who will?
What?
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Look at that - right on time.
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Who is this war against, Sam?
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Why don't you say, no system is perfect.
They couldn't be worse for the Buttles.
We've got both.
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
No, really.
What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
A heavy Christmas present.
What parcel?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
It does doesn't it?
Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me?
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
I didn't like it.
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
It's my fucking life.
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
Don't litter my cab!
Them?
No.
Who are you?
Good!
How can I act naturally, when you've trying to break my arm?
Who are you? Let go!
Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
Are you alright?
Come on up.
Who is it?
This is not a good time.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?
No, no.
Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts about this, it's my fault.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
Promise you won't go inside.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
How long you been doing this?
You married?
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
Not as good as Nino's.
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
He's better, though, right?
You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
Okay.
You can't kill my father that easy. He'll fight forever. Like with me: hasn't talked to me in three years. But it's okay. Sometimes you have to put things behind you.
Sleeping.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
He's better, isn't he?
I'll be right down.
Yes?
I'd take her, but then who would stay here?
My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.
Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
Did you see my father?
I think this place stinks.
He's dead, huh?
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.
You shouldn't smoke.
That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
It's my first cigarette in over a year.
It's not so rare. He grew up on our street. He's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
Is there any chance?
I know him. That's Noel.
Is he going to be alright?
John, play the Sinatra.
What?
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
I'm going to take it.
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
Yes.
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
You're just trying to say all great stuff so I'll feel even worse that you're not around.
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
Why not try it for a few weeks?
I just found out.  You didn't say anything to me?  You just resign? Will you meet me now? -- No, now! I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Don't say anything about anything.
Sit down, stop.
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
How?
I think you're the Devil.
This isn't friendship.
Yeah -- being a basket case.
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
What?
This is important to me.
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
I have to be somewhere.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
Aaron, will you tell me?
Then what was good about it?
Do others feel that you did well?
Do you feel good about it?
Did it really go well?
No.
How'd it go?
You too.
Okay, great -- good luck.
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
As good as humanly possible.
It's not a date.  It's co-workers going to a professional conclave.
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
Did you bring your grey suit?
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
A long time.  I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
Yes.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Well, whatever you think.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
I write for you sometimes.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
Of course.
Okay.  Great line at the end.
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
Nine seconds.
You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?
Call if you get weird.
Good night.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Sure.
Why do you say that?
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
A half hour in the lobby.
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
But thanks.
Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
Yes.
It's started.
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
Yes?
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
I'll never tell.
Yes, there is.
I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
Bobbie, please.
Right there, Bobbie.
No stop where he's all besieged.
Just a two-second dissolve.
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
Let me hear it!
Play back the last line...
Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
Fill for a second.
No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
It's not opinion.
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
I thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you?  You're more adorable than your pictures.  Look what I got for you.
Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything.
It's better when you let me say it.
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
It's okay.
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
I knew what you meant.
I don't wan to discuss work.
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
It just proves that the difference we have are...
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
You fucking...
That's more than 'yes' -- that's 'you bet.'
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
How can you say that to me?
That's so perfectly...It really makes me feel a little faint...  Whooo.
What?
No.  Did he really?
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.
Good night??!
Yes.
Uh-huh.
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Hi, again.  Sorry about...
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
Hi.  It's me.
Okay.  Sorry.  Don't yell at me like that again, you scared the life out of me.
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
What happened?
No.  I'll see you at your apartment as soon as I can.
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
This is hysterical.
At least kiss me when you do that.
Well...
Great.
Uh-uh.
Good.  That's it...See you.
Who?
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
So you like me, huh?
Oh, good.
Uh-huh.
Why, you need me for the story?
Nooo.  Is it your story?
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
Well, what is it?
What?
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
I'll get you through.  Move and smile.  And smile and move...
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
I'll be the judge of that.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself.  I feel like a little solitude.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
Okay.
Yeah?
I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
Nervous?
Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
What do you mean clean?
Billion.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
Yes.
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
How's it going?
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
Hey?
Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining and do something about it.
I agree with you -- you're not qualified.  So get qualified.  You can insist on being better prepared.  You don't have to just leave it as...  'I don't write.  I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'
It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
I trust you.
How are you at back rubs?
So great -- right?
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...
Nooo.  If I could just have a roll, I'd be okay.
If we could just eat first.
I like "godsend."
Hi.  I was worried I was early.
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
Hi.
Right back to you.
I can't be.
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
Go ahead -- what?
I'll pose any way you want.
Well I just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.
It's just an innocent question.  Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
Are you a virgin?
Walter can I ask you something?
A girl with a body like mine?
Without a stitch of clothing on, sitting and facing you...
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
Not even a little bit?
Are you nervous, Walter?
That doesn't look like very much clay.
I'm almost ready -
It's kind of dark -
What, right now?
Yeah.
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
What are you doing here?
If you were an artist you could have created something!
Oh yeah?
I'd be glad to help.  For $50 an hour.
Would you like to do me?
Don't you work here?
Walter...stay away from me!
There's...a body inside that statue!
Walter...there's...
Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
Just about anything, Walter.
Forget it.
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Now calm down Walter!  Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.
Walter, I'm sorry...
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
What are you trying to say?
Well that was for your sculpture of the girl.  Your nude in the chair.
I like you very much, Walter.
Of course I do!
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Nice night out...
Goodbye.
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
Thank you.
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Every word...
Yes Walter.
Walter!  Jeez!
Where where...
More champagne, your majesty?
Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
Is it murdered man?
Oh yeah?
What's up, Walter?
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
Hi Walter.
Now you're a professional!
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
You can do anything you want if you set your mind to it.
Let's see it.
Look at the size of it!
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
What's it called?
Great!  What is it?
Of course...it's wonderful.
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
Don't worry about him...what have you got?
Walter...I can't believe it.
When did you make this, Walter?
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
It was.
Here you go, enjoy.
That's word for word.
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
You're right.  We should build a collection first.
What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
Why not?
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
Oh come on!  Even you can see its value.
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
What's the matter with you?
Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?
Are you alright?
When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.
Are you trying to be funny?
Leonard, what are you doing?
Maybe so...
Hi Walter...
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Do you have to be so cold to him?
Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
Don't grab me, okay?
He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
Andy!
Nice game.
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
Hi, guys.
Dying.
Don't tread on the earth?
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
Probably.  What movie is this?
Yeah, I guess.
What's playing there?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
Maybe.
Yeah?
Uum... around ten?
You left me a message?
You broke up with my machine?
No, you didn't.  When?
I don't understand.
I thought we were meeting here.
Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
'Bye.
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
I do?  I guess I do.
Jealous?
Hi.
Nothing.  It was just a dream.
Nothing.
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
Mmmnkay.
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
What show is this?
Something like that.
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
I am so sure.
No...
I think you've forgotten something.
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
Get away from me!
Good thing one of us was prepared.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
I'm going out the front.
I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
I'm glad you came.
Pretty shallow of you.
Leave me alone.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
He did what he was supposed to.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
I'm going to the dance.
I'm going to the senior dance.
For the dance.
A dress.
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
Merrick...
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
Thanks.
Why'd you come back?
I didn't expect to see you.
Yeah?
Mmkay.
You sure?
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
Things are kind of confusing.
It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
Where are you gonna go?
Well, stay here tonight.
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
Yeah.
Not exactly.
You want some water or something?
How are you doing?
Is that your car?
Hi.
Buffy.
You guys are thrashed.
It could happen.
Like my homework.
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
Bugs.
See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
I know.  I like your little outfit.
You look way pretty, Kim.
Yeah, whoops I came.
I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
Get out of my facial.
Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
Kimberly, it's a dance.  It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day.
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
Excuse me for having something important to do.
Oh my God you're having an affair.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
I forgot.
You were supposed to be here at three.
Get a boob job.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
Cafe Blase.
Where?
Let's meet tonight, okay?
'Just remember you're in training, son'
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
Nice ensemble!
Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.
Totally stale.  And the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  We're thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?
Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
Beverly Center.
Well, where?
Why don't we see a movie?
What are we doing?
Please.  It's so '91.
) What do you think?
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
He knows who I am!
And where are they now?
You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
Well, you're on my turf now.  You're just gonna have to trust me.
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down?  I know it hurts the first time.
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
And it makes it worse when I die, right?
I'm curious, is all.
I wish you would.
Watchers?
How can you keep doing this?
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
Five?
I...
Oh, fuck you!
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
You are such a wet.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
Fine.
What!?!
Oh.
They were vampires?
My nails.
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
Put your head back.
Oh.  Sorry.
Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
But you threw a knife at my head!
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!
No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
No -- you don't have to --
Who we gonna beat?
Okay.
Here?
Sporting events, yeah.
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
Uh... gym.
Not a pressing issue.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
What?
Oh, him.
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Why do you keep saying that?
What, um...  What do we do?
Our purposes.
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
I have cheerleading squad.
All right.
She --
All right.  What do we do now?
Wait a minute.
None of your business.  God.
Ow.
Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.
I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
How do you know all this?
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
Oh, my God.  I never told anybody about this.  I remember the one about the peasant, too.  God, there's a bunch.  Is this, like channeling or something.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
I was a slave.
Everybody does.
Just stay away from me, okay?
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
Time to do what?
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
My birthright?  You mean, like a trust fund?
Why?
What are you talking about?
Am I in trouble or something?
What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
Oh.
I haven't seen him tonight.
Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.
Hi.
Hi, guys.
Later for it.
Nicole...
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
You're having a fling with him?
Pike.
Sorry.
Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
You and Cassandra get anything done last night?
Thanks.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
B'bye.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
I guess.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
Cassandra's really smart.
You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
I don't get it.
Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
Thank you very much.
That is so cool.
No.  It was mondo bizarro.
I was just scared is all.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
Come one, that was so weird.
Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
Good enough!
That's the plan.
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
They don't even have Dolby.
No THX.
Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
Buffy?
Okay.
Throw it out.
Well, I hope so.
I can't believe they still ate it.
Cool!
Buffy!
I gotta bail.  You coming?
Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
Nee sitch.  No way.
They'll kill us!
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Wit-tay.
As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
And the January Semi-formal --
Right.
Except for Prom.
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
So, we're stupid now?
You're so out of it.  You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee --
Like you've got a grip.
Oh, thank you very much.
Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.
What are you talking about?
I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?'  And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental.
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
I really was way way too too.
Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
Buffy, the ape-woman.
Nice much.
Smell of booze much.
Well, look who's here.
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
Right!
Oh, yeah!
Okay.
Environment.  That's cool with me.
Oh, please.
The homelesses?
Like we don't have rights too?
God!  Take a chill lozenge.
He is so bald.
Oh, God.
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
Neither will I.
Well I guess this is it.
That's great!
It's Skip, for you.
--but you're father's in there!
So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--
You don't have to...
Oh--won't YOU come in?
it's okay..
He did?
What'd he say?
Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
I'm trying to play with your body!
Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
What a nasty thing to say.
Yes I do...
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love.
That's my leg.
I'm not gonna try to seduce you, sweetie...
I'll tuck you in.
How 'bout a back rub?
I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
Get over here.
Nuke?!
Now don't go overboard, I look incredibly hot, right?
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
I'm yours.
Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
It's all the same thing.
Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.
A little better.
He's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six.
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
Right.  Okay, fire a couple in there.
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.
There are two important psychic conduits called the "pingala" and the "ida".  The pingala starts with the left testicle  and ends at the right nostril.
The right nostril.  Good.
Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
They did when they were in the Carolina League.
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie--now get some rest for tonight's game.
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
You can learn to like it.
You see how nice things are when we go slow?
Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
We all deserve to wear white.
No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
That's better.  Got the radar ready?
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble.
I can do that, too.
What?
You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...
Not yet.  It takes years of practice...
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
What happened?
It doesn't work like that.  God, you're gorgeous.  Want to dance?
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
I heard already.
Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
No.
It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else-- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home.  Don't you see?  If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is!
Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
I'm ready for a complicated man.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
I want you desperately!
He won't make love to me anymore.
I want to be had.
Don't you think I'm pretty?
He' s confused--
Crash...I want you.
I'm not a real batter.  I'm a woman.
You got me all confused.
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
Damn.
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
But they're nice hips.  I looked up your records-- You've hit 227 home runs in the minors. That's great!
Damn.
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
See my hips?
I'm not interested yet.
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
Oh my...  Don't leave...
What do you believe in?
Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction.  There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
Crash, I didn't think you--
I don't trust a man who don't dance.  It ain't natural.
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
Oh dear....easy honey...
It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through.
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
He looks great, just great!
Three-fourteen?  Hmmm...  Look't those thighs, Jackson
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
Oh let's not...
Praise the Lord, eh?
He's a good student.
Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
Shh, shh...  "They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, and discorrupt them and charge them"
Good--then listen.  "I sing the body electric.  The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--"
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
When you know how to make love, you'll know how to pitch.  Shh.  I love this part.
No, no, no.  Put it back on and take it off slowly.
No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
Oh both of you, of course...
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?
You need a nickname.
You got a live arm there.
But it was just mine.
I am calm!
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
Let me in the house! Fucker!
Oh, you are...
What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
Not gonna let me in?
You are not threatening me anymore!
Don't you threaten me!
Don't you threaten me!
I am not!
You come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
You get down here!
Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!  Fuck you!
So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
I wouldn't -
I wouldn't do that...
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
I want you to let me go.
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
Fuck you.
Oh, sh-
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
Oh...
Hi, Sam.
I can back him off.
I was with somebody.
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
Why do you want to do that?
She had the same.
I had a... salad.
To the Riviera.
With Jennifer.
Oscar wants you to call him.
Oh.  I got your cigarettes.
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
I threw it away.
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
Fuck you!
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
The arrangement is over!
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
Let go of me! Let go of me!
Get off of me! Stop it!
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
Would you knock it off, Sam?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I bought him a watch too.
Mm-hm.
He wanted a watch, too.
He needed some clothes.
With what?
Okay?
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
Yeah.
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
Pretty serious.
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
I gotta tell ya...
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
Right.
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
No, you don't.
That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
I don't need one.
Okay, okay.
Okay.
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am.
I said, you can't make me stop caring about people.
You can't make me stop caring...
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
You didn't have to beat him up!
I didn't take your pills.
Huh?
No, he didn't.
You can trust me.
Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
No.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
Yeah.
Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's just that... well, I need more than that. I need twenty-five thousand.
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Oh, fabulous.
Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  Put your arm in there.
Hi. Nice to see you.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
Okay.
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
Oh...
Oh, it's so soft.
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
Okay.
Yeah. Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
I'm not crying.
Yeah.
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
Understand?  I'm sorry.
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
What, are you trying to handicap me?
Good luck.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.
Hey, Mitch.
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
Hello.
Okay, thank you for asking.
I'll be right back.
I'm going to go powder my nose.
You just - Just stop him.
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
And here. Here.
Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay?
Can I go in?
Can I go in?
Fucker!
He won't let me go in my house!
I'm just trying to get in my house!
He won't let me in my own house!
He won't...
I'll to the FBI!
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
But I'm just trying to leave.
What?
For what?
You fucked with me for the last time!
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
What about my money?
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
Yeah. Uh-huh -
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Nicky, please...
Yeah.
Yeah.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
I need some help. I do. I need some help.  You gotta help me. I need a new sponsor, Nicky.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
Exactly.  He hates me.
No, he's not.
Sure did.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
I did what you told me to.
Exactly.
I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Yeah?
I don't -
Nothin'.
Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
Bye.
So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
Thank you.
Thanks.
You're so nice.
Oh, come on.
Yeah.  Thanks.
Okay.
He gives a fuck what I do?
He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
I do.
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more.
Mm, you want to steal it?
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
Am I right?
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
Yeah, no shit.
Tell me.
Hi, how are you?
Hi, Jennifer.
But I saw something...
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
Well, how 'bout that?
Get lost?
Get lost?
What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't steal anything from you.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
Come on.
Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances and drive fast.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
I told you I was hot tonight.
Yes!
You're driving me nuts!
No, I'm gonna drive.
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
He called you right here.
Here.
Lester - he called you here.
We'll go later.
It means I got the money.
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye.
Okay, then.
You do?
Promise?
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
No, Lester.
I love you.
I am.
I'm always here for you.
I'm here.
Yeah.
All right.
Then do it the way you want.
You are right. What can I...
You'll get a heart attack like that.
Take it easy, though.
I know it, I know it.
I know, but that's enough.
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
That's enough.
Again!
There's a lot of people here.
Since when do you talk like that?
What's the matter with you?
Hey! Oh!
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you, Jeff.
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
Hmm. Not bad.
Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
Uh Brock, today you are without me...
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
I'm sure.
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
Well, it's just that I would think that the woman who is the real, non- imitation Catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea. Really angry.
A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!
No it's not.
I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten.  When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
You designed Gotham Plaza?  The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
I'm not afraid. Are you?
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
How heroic of you...
You're probably right.
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
I wonder..
I don't know. I can't remember.
Guilty. I am.
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
In women?
What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
Stop.
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
What's the good news?
I'll let you know.
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
You know, now that I hear myself tell it, I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What, you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday, then Brock takes it for the weekend...
Then there's you, Louis, sneaking through back alleys and surprise visiting me at my home..Both of you have been way too frisky from the get- go. I'm actually a pretty amazing person--funny, smart, attractive when I get my sleep--but you two had no way of knowing that-- when I met you both I was basically a morose, depressed amnesiac incapable of any human feeling. The only reason one of you wanted to go out with me is because you knew I was Catwoman.
Lose the smile, Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night--good food, good conversation--some Catwomen show up and it's "You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout--Oh, I'm sorry, I mean "warehouse."
Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."
I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.
You are...
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
Hey, I thought...
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
Like you don't know...
Nothing. How's your hand?
Did you try to kill...
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
You turned around!
Hey, Captain God!
Next time, call...
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
But of course you are.
Enough.
I actually got some memory back last night.
Yeah, she's okay.
I don't know what came over me.
Uh. "Thanks?"
"I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
But I'm blind.
Trust me, you won't have to.
I don't know if I can do it alone.
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
Because she asked me--and I couldn't very well turn her down. Don't you remember-- of course you don't remember--that "Hag" is the one who brought you to that hospital in Gotham City. For what it's worth-- currently not much--we owe her your life...When I think about a single woman in Gotham City--amnesia is probably the best thing that could happen to a girl like you...Oh, don't forget your visor.
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
Don't sneak up on me...
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
Pretty good...Mom, I don't want you to think I don't appreciate...letting me stay, getting me the job--I've been a mess. I'm still a mess. It's just...we have to start having a different conversation. I can't take..
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Maybe.
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
Yes, Mother. Dear.
You're late.
Nice breasts.
You going to talk all day?
The kicks..the rush..you mean, like pulling heists..faking your own deaths..killing innocent bystanders...like Mexican angels.  I know you're a woman. Do you?
You seem sad, Spooky.
What's it like being a superhero?  It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
Oh pooh, come now. If you turn me down, I just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be..
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie.
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
Taking messages.
Don't you have children?
Do I hear a woman's voice?
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
What else did you expect him to say?  Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun.
He's seen both of us now.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
Any minute.
Nels?
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
Allow me.
Lose the hardware now.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
I told you ... sooner or later you'd have to trust me ...
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...
-- The phones, Theo.  Don't leave any of them behind.  The cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
Five ... six.
Pull over!  Pull over someplace.
You won't live to see it.
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
Took preparation.
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
Both hands on your lap.
He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
That's not good enough.
Only one way to find out.
Naturally.
You're the man with the gun.
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
Why are we stopping?
Think you could do a picture of me?
They did some great job of reforming you.
Any idea where you're going?
The money, Nels ... ?
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
Some people fall apart in a pinch. But you shine.
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
Do you think they'll walk away?
259-7881.
No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
Did you hear that?
He wants 75 back.
I'm still okay.
Stop talking like that!
You wouldn't --
You could've hit me.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
A typical fuck-up.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
Do you have to point that?
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
Shit.  You couldn't be in much worse shape.
Who's in back?
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
I thought it was inspired.
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
There isn't any such person.
The rest of the money is here in the car.  Why don't you come and get it?
He had a gun.  I have it now.
Hand me the phone.
They put their hands all over me.
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
You're going to let them get away with this?
Why didn't you just shoot them?
She'll never be the same.  None of us will.
Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
It's locked.
Rachel -- Oh my God.
I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Why can't it be her?
Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
Yes.
I can't do it.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
Yes sir.
Yes.
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
They're tied with duct tape so they can't speak -- but they seem to be --
God, if he doesn't come back --
What did you do?
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
Yes?  Yes?
No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know!
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
No.
When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
If it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants.  Tufts, you know.  It still hasn't grown fully in.  The other one is from the islands.  Braided hair -- very dark.
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
To hide it from the I.R.S.
Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
Don't say that.
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
Even if you found us -- what then?
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
What do you mean?
The City National on San Vincente.
The one in Brentwood.
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
What's happening?
No.
That's not her.
I can hear you again, clearly.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
You're breaking up.  I can't hear you.  Theo?
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
Our house always needs touching up.
What do you do for a living?
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
And that was the end of it?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
A woman?
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
How much time do you have left on it?
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
What are you doing now?
What about the others?
Will you please speak to me! Theo?
Why isn't anyone answering me?
She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
26th off Wilshire.
"Theo?"
He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
They don't know you.  They won't listen.
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
Please.
No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
No -- nothing.
I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
Then hang up!  Do it!
Because you know you'll be killing us.
You won't disconnect.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
My name is --
I don't believe you.
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
They're holding my husband downstairs.
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
Will you let me explain!
You don't understand.
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James...
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
What was it?
Lucky you.
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
I sincerely hope so.
You a handyman, Fergie?
Some judge...
Yes?
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
Perfect.
You were made for this.
You know what. Go.
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
Och, you do, Fergie.
So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us.
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
You're never out, Fergus.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
So you did fuck up.
We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
Eddie and Tinker died.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up.
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
My pleasure.
Someone's got to do it.
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
He's all right.
Can't.
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
Horny bastard.
Do you want some food?
I said shut the fuck up --
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
You shut your face --
It was fun while it lasted.
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
Come and get me, soldier --
People. They could be looking.
You never know.
Not here.
Tell me, Jody
You didn't?
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
You don't know me, do you?
The teddy bear?
You're crazy --
No, we are.
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
We will separate -- you look over there.
What?
What's the matter, chérie?
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
Oh la vache!
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
What is it about?
Who is it from?
He's allergic to him.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
Do you know him?
Have you no idea who could have done it?
At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
Didn't Charles have any friends?
He knows everything.
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
But that is no reason to get a divorce!
But why do you want a divorce?
But what?
Ça alors! From Charles?
Va jouer, mon ange.
No!
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
No I wasn't.
Who is she Daddy?
You know her?
She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
It was a she.
I thought you'd be pleased.
You are upset.
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
Not much further.
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
A little.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
What do you mean?
What's wrong?
I will. Is that all?
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
It won't happen again.
What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
Daddy you scared me!
This will relax her.
Did you warn her?
Well?
She just turned off her light.
What happened?
You're not?
Daddy....

Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
You're the killed.
Yes.
_ Your father raped someone?
What do you know about my father?
Me? Why me?
Really?
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
Of course I'm scared.
You know about that too?
Sure.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
I am.
Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety.
I can't right now.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
Stag?
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
I won't.
Especially not your dad.
Ok.
You can't tell your parents.
No.
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
What party?
Mark invited me to the party.
What?
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
FINE. Are you?
You ok?
The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
Someone tried to kill me.
NO?!
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
Not that many.
There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
OK. increase the peace.
I promised I'd go right home after school.
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best friend.
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
No!
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
He says he loves me.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
I was desperate. It was gross.
Oh nice save.
I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties.
Does she fuck?
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
No! That's his table.
Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years.
You eventually have to talk to him.
The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.
I don't watch him eat everyday.
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
Why?
Mark Shale.
Who?
Go sit next to him.
No.
You Miss Dunlop?
Don't you think it's sick?
You heard about that?
This place is empty.
Twenty eight years ago.
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
What are you doing?
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
Thanks for coming back for me.
Go to the police station!
My dad's down there!
Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
What?
This party is sick.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
I'm making you feel like meat?
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
I'll think about it.
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
I do not.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
Did Sharon say no?
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
I did.
I'm fine.
What?
I got to get home.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
Cut it out.
NO!
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
Who was the fourth?
Yes.
The principal?
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
You're not telling me something.
Two men left town right after it happened.
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Who?
Who were they?
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
The word is Mob.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
How could you?
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
And the police did nothing?
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
Why not?
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
You didn't believe her?
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
Attacked how?
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.
What?
Wait.
Don't make me order you.
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
Who is she?
I want you to come home with me right now, Jody.
The library. I'll be fine.
Where are you going?
Not that I know of.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
Did he say anything else about her?
That's what he said.
What?
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
Yeah. Who is she?
Lisa Sherman?
Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman?
You can ask me anything.
I need to ask you something.
Yes?
Mom?
Hi princess.
Hi mom.
His mother's an only child.
On what side of the family?
Kenny's aunt?
Yeah.
Yes?
You're the one who's hand is shaking.
So are you.
No, you keep one.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
And she didn't?
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
Well yes.
A private investigator?
Yes.
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
Certainly not!
No.
No.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
Of course.
I'm all right.
He didn't wear bifocals.
Okay...
With us.
Where can we go?
I have to go home and get my things.
How about a plane?
Back to Mexico.
Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
She's my sister and my daughter!
She's my sister.
She's my daughter.
Katherine.
...no...
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
What are you saying?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
What the hell is this all about?
No...
What did you do that for?
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
Upstairs. Why?
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Did you get some sleep?
...That's not what I meant.
Aren't you coming back with me?
I can't...
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
You're insane.
What does it look like?
Yes.
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
She's too upset.
I am not!
She's not tied up!
The police?
You bastard.
It's possible. Please don't ask me any more questions now. Just wait, wait for me. I'll be back. I need you here.
It's possible.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
Do? To who?
What did he say?  What did he say?
You didn't tell me.
You saw my fa... father? When?
He owns it. You know?
It has to do with my father.
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
Just... I have to.
...Yes, sort of a birthmark...
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
What about it?
What's wrong?
Could you do anything about it?
...No. Why was it.
Hold still. Why?
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
Doing what?
What were you doing there?
Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
When was the last time?
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
I gave everybody the night off.
Why?
I'll stay.
They can't be.
Is that unusual?
What? What is it?
And Hollis knew about it?
No, I think I'd remember.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
No.
The Valley?
What dam?
What are you thinking?
Of course I'm sure.
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
Oh.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
I'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved.
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
What for? There's nothing more to say.  Get my car, please.
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
Another satisfied client?
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
How did it happen?
I don't believe you.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
Yes... why?
K... Cross.
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
I mean I can't tell you.
I can't tell you.
Is there anything else you want to know?
Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
Mr. Gittes.
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
Unless what?
Why?
I was grateful.
My husband.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
But he wasn't killed.
It wasn't much of a lie.
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
I have?
Well, how much would you like?
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
Oh... thank you.
...Just a minute...
Please call first.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
No. I went riding rather early.
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
What do you mean?
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
I said I'll drop it.
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
That's not his apartment.
My husband's at the office.
Iced tea.
Would you like something to drink?
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending.
What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own.
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
I told him I'd take his advice. But before I went away I left you that note...  I was on my way down the stairs...
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.
My husband...you know him.
All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
The son of one of his colleagues. Don't act that way. We'll talk about it later. Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with the five o'clock bus.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
So what'd they say?
I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
For what?
But...who...
Father, I have sinned...
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
Hi. Why are you running?
Elena. My name's Elena.
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
You don't really think so?
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
I know.
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
Look at that.
Let's hope they like it there.
These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
I'll write it myself.
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A new broom sweeps clean.
Ready for dinner, Brad?
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
Two cents.
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish the notice.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
Go on!
Thais.
What does it say there?
That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
Where is he?
I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?
I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean.  There's a front page story in the "Chronicle,"  and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing.  Probably murdered.  A Mrs. Harry Silverstone.  Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning?
That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
You've got a private office here, haven't you?
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
I don't my plans myself.
Ask them to sit down.
Are they standing for me?
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
Has he said when he'll finish?
That's Leland, isn't it?
It isn't finished?
Is it good?
And the notice?
Was the show covered by every department?
We've got a nice plant here.
Of course.
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
I think I understand, Mr. Rogers, but I wonder if -
Let him finish, Charles.
Charles!  Your - your breaking this man's neck -  would scarcely explain this note -  Serious consequences for Mr. Kane -  for myself, and for my son.  What does this note mean, Miss -
How do you do?  I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me...  because I recieved this note -
If you're asking me to sympathize with him, Brad, you're wasting your time.  There's only one person I'm sorry for, as a matter of fact.  That - that shabby little girl.  I'm really sorry for her, Brad.
I know it is, Brad -
Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -
Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
Hello, Brad -
Too late for what?  Too late for you and this -  this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?  Well, you won't do it, I tell you.  You won't do it!
Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
Go on!  Get out!  I can fight this thing all alone!
You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think -
No.
I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
Oh yes, there is.
I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.  I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing.
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
Oh!!
I'm going to -  - 185 West 74th Street.
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
I intend to find out.
It may not be about anything at all.
What's this all about, Emily?  I've had a very tiring day and -
No, it can't.  Good night, darling.
It can wait.
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
They won't hurt you, darling. Mother's with you!  Mother's looking after you!
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right.  He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.
Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen -
Please don't talk any more, Charles.
They won't do anything to Junior, darling.  Anonymous letter writers -   I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -
Charles.
What do you expect me to do?  What in the world -
Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
Don't go, Susan.
Goodbye, Charlie.
You can't stop me.
I won't let you go.
- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
Yes.
No, you're not.
I'm going to leave you.
I'm not sorry.
Don't tell me you're sorry.
Susan, it seems to me -
You'll never have another chance to hit me again.  I never knew till this minute -
Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me or anybody else!  You want to be loved - that's all you want!  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me!  Don't expect me to love you -
You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan.  Whatever I do -  I do - because I love you.
Susan!
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
Susan, I really think -
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
You're my wife, Susan, and -
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
Invite everybody!  Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents!  Who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own - with their own bath, where they know where everything is?
I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
Can't we go back, Charlie?
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
At night?
Half past eleven.
I mean in New York.
Half past eleven.
Charlie!  I said, what time is it?
That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0
Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Well, I -
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Would you sing for me?
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Yes -
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
Is that what you want to do?
I work at Seligman's.
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
I didn't say.
How old did you say you were?
Oh, me -
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
I was only joking!  This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and -
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
You really don't know who I am?
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
A rooster?
No.  But you're close.
A chicken?
I'll get these streets fixed, if it's the last thing I do.
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
Thanks.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
Where's the towel?
I know...  But you do look so silly.
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
Oh!
I always like to see the funny side of things.  No sense crying when you don't have to.  And you're so funny.  Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
You're very easily amused.
In the water.
Where's the soap?
No.  They've passed on.
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.
Thanks.
If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
You're no Venus de Milo.
Oh!
You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
What's funny now?
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
You've got some on your face.
Hmm!
Toothache.
What's the matter with you?
Ow!
What are you waiting here for? Why don't you go?
Charlie, please don't -
Get out, both of you!
I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -
Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected.  To start with, I'll break your neck.
I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea -
Don't you worry about me.  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
You do anything you want to do. The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust.  If you want to know, they've already decided. The election Tuesday'll be only -
I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -
I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
Thanks.
It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
You can't.
If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro?
Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
You're right.  We did lose a million dollars last year.
On the other hand -  I am the publisher of the Enquirer. As such, it is my duty - I'll let you in on a little secret, it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent, hard-working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money- mad pirates because, God help them, they have no one to look after their interests!  I'll let you in on another little secret, Mr. Thatcher.  I think I'm the man to do it.  You see, I have money and property -
As Charles Foster Kane, who has 			eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you.  Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him.  You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.
The trouble is, Mr. Thatcher, you don't realize you're talking to two people.
Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
Can you prove it isn't?
I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of.
Where'm I going?
You goin', Mom?
I didn't used to be afraid of it.
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
Persia.  It belonged to a king.
Do you know what that is?
Not my wife - not either of them.
Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
Raymond -
Lock it - and keep it locked.
Close the door, Raymond.
Is Mrs. Kane -
All right.
Get Dr. Corey.
Hello, Brad.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth.
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
Hey, Brad!  I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
It's simpler than that, Brad.  A society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all.  Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -
Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
Are you finished?
The personal note is all there is to it.  It's all there ever is to it.  It's all there every is to anything!  Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people.  They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
Why is she leaving me?
Brad, you are drunk.
I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
All right.
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
Why, Brad?
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
I'll get you some coffee.
What's wrong, Brad?
Go ahead.
I've got to think of Emily -
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
What do you mean by that?
Why not?
Yes?
Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
You're wrong.  It does make a difference to you -  Rector's, Brad?  Come to think of it, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent.  You won't miss anything.  It isn't much of a war. Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island.
Yes?
You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken."  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
I mean I've got a job for you.
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
And I do it because they do it, and they do it - it's a vicious circle, isn't it?  I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad - you know, Georgie, don't you?
How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
All right, Brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - I'd want to.  Hello, Georgie.
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
It's a good idea for a newspaper.  Four hundred sixy thousand.
People are going to know who's responsible.  And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly.  And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light.
A wasted day.
Tired?
What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for -
I think it's beginning to dawn on Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say. With Mr. Rogers out of the way, Reilly, I think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state.  Well, Mr. Bernstein?
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
Oh, yes, the bonus.
What check?
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
What do you mean by that?
I know.  If you're smart, you'll talk to Raymond.  That's the butler. You can learn a lot from him.  He knows where the bodies are buried.
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
He wanted me to be comfortable - Oh, why should I bother?  You don't believe me, but it's true.  It just happens to be true.  He was really interested in my voice.  What are you smiling for?  What do you think he built that opera house for?  I didn't want it.  I didn't want to sing.  It was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him.
He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
What do you mean?
I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
I had a toothache.
You wouldn't want to hear a lot of what comes into my mind about myself and Mr. Charlie Kane.
How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
Get out of here!  Get out!  Get out!
Why don't you people let me alone? I'm minding my own business.  You mind yours.
Think again!
Who told you you could sit down here?
No, don't!
I feel nauseous.
You two better quit it.
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
Awww. That was so cute.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
I'll try to manage.
Such a sordid state of affair.
You're kidding.
Why aren't there any lights?
Can I use the bathroom?
God, isn't he great?
So where is he?
Dick.
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
You can hold me down.
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
She said not to come home until graduation.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
Oh God...
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick!
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
Stop this. This isn't funny.
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
Do you always talk weird after you violate women?
How'd you get here so fast?
I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.  See you later, handsome.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
You're such an asshole.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
He's not invited.
Sang.
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
You mean, on a date?
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
You work in a market, all right.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
You're serious. You want to date again.
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
Look how full of yourself you are.
You don't have anything to do with it.
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
I just told you.
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
I'm giving him his ring back.
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
Was I right?
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
No.
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
Well... kind of, sort of?
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
I'm not pregnant.
It's not what you think.
You saw it?
You're just going to lock the store like that?
Train. It took eight hours.
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
Dante. You've got a customer.
Just now.
Fuck you.
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
Good.  I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne.
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
Thank you for being rational.
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
And that made you feel better?
What did he say?
You had to tell him.
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
Goodbye, Dante.
I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
I love you. Don't feel sick.
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
I'm going to class.
Um. Thirty-seven.
Lower your voice!
Something like thirty-six.
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Let it go...
Dante...
Please calm down.
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
That's because I never had sex with him!
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
I'm serious...
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
Why do you say that?
He gets off on it.
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
You!
I'm not the pig you are.
Three including you.
Three.
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
You're a pig.
You've slept with twelve different girls?
It better be up to and including me.
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
How many girls have you slept with?
How many?
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
And I actually date you?
Oh, you think so?
How flattering.
"Be there?"
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
Typically male point of view.
I was kidding.
Ooh! Can we?!
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
You're trusting.
How much money did you leave up there?
She called you, didn't she?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
What were you doing?
What were you doing up so late?
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
You're kidding.
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
Why did you agree to come in then?
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
At least they weren't lit.
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
I'm going to have a word with that asshole.
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
I'm not sad.
I... I don't know what to say.
And... he told you all of this?
Bye  That was Snowball.
I will. Take it easy.
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him.
No, I'm just visiting my man.  Dante, this is Willam Black.  This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.
Willam!
Where's the radio?
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
I copy.
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff?  Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft.
Hal's signalling he's OK.
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
What about you?!
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
Forget it!  I refuse!
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
I won't do it.  No way.
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
What about you?
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
Thanks for holding on.
Don't let me fall!
Gabe!
Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Never
This rope is sixty years old!
What?
We might be able to go that way.
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
Get it!
No luck?
Gabe are you alright?
Can you see light?
Gabe!  Are you alright?
If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
Breathtaking.
Want me to lead?
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
Gabe...your arm?
Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.
No, actually it was more like mutual attacking.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
It was great.
Remember the first time we came up here?
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
What about you?
You know me, I'm a night person.
Excuse me?
For the same reason you did, to help.
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
Where's Hal, what's going on?
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
Gabe!?
Can't do it?  I don't believe this.  Don't you feel anything?
I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--
You mean the nerve.
What if he can't?
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
And I can't leave.
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
Where?
Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't.
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
Listen to you...  The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?
A flare up...
Which could maybe what?
Resuscitation?
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Did I miss something?
Excuse me?
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
I don't understand?
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
I know...
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
Where've you been?
Hello, Gabriel.
The winds are picking up.
Don't believe it...  You know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter. Everything you think just pours right out.
Oh, please.
Enough.
You can stop right there.
He knows it well.
Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar.
Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?
Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?
Patience my love, patience.
Then it's a deal.
Oh, my God!
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
Where's the rest of the team?
Who's going with you?
Got to be Comb Bluff.
Go after her.
Copy.  Hal, tell Gabe he only makes advances <u>to me</u> or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.
You've heard Beethoven before?
Are you referring to the background score?
You felt ill this afternoon because you're getting better. You see, when we're healthy we respond to the presence of the hateful with fear and nausea. You're becoming healthy that's all. By this time tomorrow you'll be healthier still.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
Something like that.
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
We're going to friends now, sir.
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
How're you feeling this morning?
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
In my office?
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
Max...
Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow...
No, no way, I couldn't take that...
How often you go?
When was the last time you took one?
Just had one.
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
Most of the time.
Yeah.
Not quite.  He did defense.  I'm a prosecutor...
Bottega.
You psychic?
Like what?
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
No.  You were right, I was wrong...  ...Max.
Go ahead, say it.
You got a deal.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
What?
Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.
Any special reason?
Who?
What happened?
I love you, too.
You think it's a conspiracy?
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
Don't do this.
Geronimo is down.
What about you?
How did you know?
Where are you?
You knew just what I was there for.
Without a love of my own.
You saw me standing alone ...
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
I'm sorry.
You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
I believe you.
How'd you get the picture?
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
Why not?
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
Someone else might call it stalking.  My dad felt it.  He started carrying a gun.
Back where?
Love at first sight?
Then tell me what happened.
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
Did you kill my father?!
At a horse show.
I don't understand.
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
Did you kill my father?
Did you kill him?
You go.  Send me a postcard.
My father's house.
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
What about them?
What's in Connecticut?
Where are we going, Jerry?
Now what?
We're going to Queens?
What is it?
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
Thanks.
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
Now's not really the time to get into this --
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
Jerry, I --
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
What?
If that's what you want.  Yes.
Okay, I will.
A water main broke.
They're big details, Jerry.
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
Where then?
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
Murdered?
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
Realized what?
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
Where'd you get your subscribers?
What van?
Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.
You watch me, don't you?
Not this again.
He was murdered.
Please put it down.
That was him.
I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
How is it possible?
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
Who are you, Jerry?
Has this happened to you before?
Was that who I thought it was?
What are you doing?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
You got a list?
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
Can you prove any of this?
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
Are these yours?
Equitation.
This would be it?
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
Surprise me.
You okay?
Believe you about what?
You're certifiable.
What newsletter?
So why are they after you?
That's it?
Do they have a secret handshake?
What is it with you and the space program?
Nothing scary there.  Sorry.
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
Till today, I haven't believed a word.  Now, I'm curious.  Six months, eleven days.  I'm going to give you one more hour to impress me.  Where to?
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
As opposed to?
Yeah.
Them who?
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
I can't promise you anything.
He says a dog bit his nose.
<u>Heart attacks happen</u>.
For what?
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
People do have heart attacks.
What is?
I'll see you tomorrow.
What?
Just relax.
You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
You bit someone's nose off?
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
No.
I think you're different.
I can't promise you anything.
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
Motive?
Well, I -- Jerry, the point.  Get there.  What does it have to do with the President?
Not for years.
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
I don't see the connection.
It's okay.  I'm game.
I don't understand.
You sound so sure.
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
Where'd you get it?
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
I don't believe you.
I'm still listening.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
A dog.
Jerry told me he bit your nose.
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
Terminal?
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
Excuse me?
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
You've asked me that one three times.
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
And you feel bad for it?
Excuse me?
Can I ask you something?
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
Working.
Working.
Agent Lowry?
Then this is a goddamn emergency.
Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.
-- Understood.
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
This doesn't make sense.
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
Not today...
I don't think so.
What do you suggest?
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
Where do you think Jerry is?
He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
And Jonas?
Nothing.  I was just making sure. So, who are you?
Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
I want to believe you, too.
Do you believe me?
Can I talk to you a second?
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
Jonas?
Agent Lowry.
No.  Not yet.
I was just thinking that.
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
You don't understand --
Wait --
Tell me about it.
I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
Is it possible...?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Thank you?
What would you have me say, David?
Good luck, David.
This... seemed best.
Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
You...
What?
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
It'll just take a moment.
Do you have a minute -- ?
David --
You mean --
What is it?  What's happened?
Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
Are you threatening me?
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
With me.
What?  Why?
Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
It's hardly yesterday; the signal's been traveling for over twenty-six years.  As for why...  I'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out -- to see if there's another message buried deeper in the signal.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
David --
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
Meaning...
You can't just pull the plug, David.
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
No doubt.
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
Oh?  How's he doing?
Pepsi?  Tequila?
Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
You're --
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
I'm willing to take that risk.
Well --
Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
How can that be?
And?
What?
Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
A third layer.
What...
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
How's the spying tonight, guys?
I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
Put it on speakers.
I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis... too old.
J39 Z186...?
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
It's a civilian facility.
Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
It's beautiful.
This is how you see the sky?
Nice.  Where?
Ellie.  Pulsar?
Dr. Cullers?
Because I can't.
-- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
By our standards... yes.
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
There is no direct evidence, no.
I don't have an official response, Michael.  All I have are the same questions you have.
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
That's terrific, but there's one problem:  we don't have the means to receive all the data on our own.
Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
And a hundred mile airspace.
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
You want to classify prime numbers?
This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
No.  Please.
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
None taken... but ... do we get to come back?  Others of my kind, I mean.
No!  I mean... why so soon?
So.  What happens now?
... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
The librarian... or the library...?
Can you help us?
So we passed some kind of test?
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
So who...?
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
Why did you contact us?
Can you show me?
So who -- what -- are you?
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
You're not real.  None of this is.
Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
Okay.
Pensacola.
Okay, okay... there.
Could we hear God?
Could we hear to the moon?
Could we hear to China?
But what do I say?
I can't move any smaller.
Why don't you come back with me?
-- of Hadden Industries.
The systems integration site.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
What are you talking about?  It's over.
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
What's that?
It's so... small.
Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
And in return?
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
Some kind of circuitry...?
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
A page-break signal.  A period.
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
I didn't realize I was out.
What kind of deal?
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
You live here.
S.R. Hadden...  You compromised our security codes.
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
I thought you were here because you want to go.
I'd say this is slightly different.
We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone!  The tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at...  ... the tape...
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
How long was I gone?
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
Wait -- hold on a minute --
I'm -- I'm fine.
Like it.  Almost there.
That you, Valerian?
Someone tell me this is really happening.
You too.
Peter.
You sonofabitch.
I'm serious about this, Peter --
Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
But the work --
But what about your research -- ?
Greenbank?
We could be together again --
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
The V.L.A.?
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
I've examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing.  Still, we've barely started...
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar...  God, I've missed you.
'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
What a coincidence.  It happens to be my fetish too.
I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
Sounds like a Russian general.
Ellie.  Arroway.
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
Something my dad -- they -- said. 'After all the suffering, after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other.'  The one thing that makes it bearable is love.
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
But --
It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
They don't believe me.
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
Pretty ironic, huh?  I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
Hi.
And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
I can't hear this now --
-- I don't know --
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
Please --
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
I can't do this --
I'm sorry -- I can't --
I'm sorry.
I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
Thank you.
The final countdown.
I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
How do you mean?
... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.  How did you do it?  How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?
It's late.  We should go back.
It's getting late...
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
I read your book.
It's what my whole life's been... aimed at; the only thing that's given it a sense of purpose.
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
Something like that.
If you came back.
In other words.
It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
I don't think so.
Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
Yes.  Very much.
I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
Can you try?
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
I flinched.
And mind, yes.  What are you --
That's not faith, it's physics.  The second law of thermodynamics.
Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
Champagne please.
And where exactly does that put your position...?
For managing the truth.  But the truth won't be managed, sir.  It stops being the truth the moment you try.
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
Laugh it up, kid. You'll make out.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
No.
What went wrong?
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
I ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because I'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
What are you doin' here?
Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
You bastard!
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to...
You're fired.
Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
Get out!  All of you!
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
I can't, Andy.
About what?
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
I want to die.
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
Andy?
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>!  I know it was him!
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
Tell her about <u>what</u>?
Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.
We'll get the paramedics...
You talked to me.  Do you remember?
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
Yes.  I believed him.
When he was seventeen.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
The first two murders.
The same as the first time...
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
Because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee told me that Joan of Arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear.
I thought he was lying.
He was lying.
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
Yes.  Without question.
What Friday?
You already made the delivery?
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
Doesn't work that way.  You had your chance, now fuck yourself...
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
In jail.
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
What book?
Hello, Daryll Lee.
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
Where it began -- McCluskey Auditorium.
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
You know I can't do that.
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
Where are you, Peter?
Who was the man in the basement?
Well, thanks.
Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  <u>You</u> need a ride home.  And you don't even know it.
Oh, shut up, and don't be so damn self righteous.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
Christ, Helen.  The first time, we're ahead of the son of a bitch! I can't leave you like this -- and there's no time.  Knock yourself out.
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
Out.  Where does he go?  Nowhere. What does he do?  Nothing.
I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
Maybe you should...
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
Who's the married man?
Where's the john?  Let me clean up this mess, and get back to work.
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both!
Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...
What happened to you?!
You do that one, I don't want it...
They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones...
They get fan letters...
'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.
It's not chronological: Son of Sam was before Hillside.
It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
What's that siren?
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
Because I'm all you've got.
Why should I trust you?
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
Halloran.
I'm giving you Clint outside.
This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
You're afraid of him.
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
That's not consistent... You said they never changed their style, they're robots...
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
Is that it?
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
Please thank Inspector Goetz for taking care of me last night.
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
Ruben.
Clint is putting a guard on you. But if you swear to leave the computer on, Winona will assign him to the hall outside.
That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
Who turned off the Internet computer...
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
Then what do you need me for?
But it's a different m.o.
That's no surprise.
We've got another one.
I want a guard on you.  I'm worried about leaving you alone.
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
Because I'm his damned pin-up girl! His, all of them!  They know me. They're in prisons with libraries, they collect clippings, I'm their worthy opponent.  You keep my name out of this.
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
We'll show that to...
<u>He</u> won't.
One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
I'm going to put a guard on your door.
It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
How do you know that?
Work with me.
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
Why imitate a dead serial killer?
I sent Andy out on murder missions. For God's sake -- it's the Boston Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used their own stockings to strangle them.  Tied in a bow-knot.
How did you know they were stockings?
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
Nothing.
The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?
He felt remorse.  He covered her.
How do you know that?
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
For months... last October.
Is it an ongoing case?
You can't go out lecturing?  Tough shit.  Women are dying.  Where can I lay this stuff out?
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
Would you want to work with us on this?
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way.
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
What calls?  I haven't made any calls.
Because of your phone calls.
If he's not out, why are they here?
Who?
Is he out?
Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor impulse control.
That's an opinion, not evidence...
I think this is number three...
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
You're calling me a crank?
No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here.
Who is this?
What else?
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
He was in my apartment!
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
Go and look for a note.
Is there a phone booth there?
Listen to me.  Is there a gas station nearby?
Don't hang up!
She on the passenger side?
It's a woman shot in a car?
Will you stay?  Please?  I'm afraid to sleep... I don't want...<u>him</u>...in my head...
The lock...
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
Well.  Another time, then.  I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.
Are you always so bold?
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
MaryJane.  You think that logic and police procedure, order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night.  I did once. But you know how he'll get caught? He'll have an accident, or some cop will get lucky.  You can't catch him by being intelligent and working hard.  Or the worst:  there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way, month after month.  The news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows, and hurry home before dark.  And then, one day, there are no more.  What happened?  Did he just stop?  Get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more? Did he kill himself?  Did he die in an auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or get sick and die?  It's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth.  And you never know.  But you keep asking yourself -- when you read about a new murder -- is he back?
I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
He's brilliant.  This one is brilliant.
It's gone.  The file's not here.  What did you do?
It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you.
He can get into my computer any time he likes!  This is exactly the kind of thing I didn't want to have happen.
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
In the sixties.  He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison.
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
I don't want this.  What are they?
You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.
He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
Okay.
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...
Over here.
Who came in after you?
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.
You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
Just horseshit luck.
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say?
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
God, you're cute when you're mad.
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Oh, I know.
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
Because it's your job, that's all.
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
Helen... excuse me, we...
Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too young.
The woman's unstable.  You could wind up with a harassment charge. <u>Anything</u>.  You're like some horny little teenager.
You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
Yeah, everything's different.
Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
Look at her legs.
What about her arms?
Quinn decided we should form a task force -- they're all one case, now. He wants all the senior detectives on it...  She wasn't killed here.
My promise.
Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
Let's get out of here...
Tell it to your shrink.
Honest to God, Ruben!
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Order Chinese for us and meet me the library?  Anything but beef.
Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
Snotty neurotic bitch...
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.
Answer it.
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...
Give me Ruben back...
Or the F.B.I.?
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
I gotta have Ruben, and a...
Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together...
Because I think I'm wrong.
Helen Hudson...
I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.
You're damn right I do.
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
We could use a little help.
Oh, maaaaan?!
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
Don't swear at me because we got problems.  I'm just giving you the news.  I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach.  On the knuckles they teach.
Yessir.  I have reflected on that, sir.  Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir.
Yessir.
That's always your privilege, sir.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
Good.
Right.
Right.
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
You messed with the scene.
We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
Detective Niccoletti?
You messed with the evidence.
I just got here.  Talk to you later...
I just got here myself, Susan.
James.
I'd like to go back. James...
One of my suitors.
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
My last lesson's next week.  James... my car...
I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive?
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
Is he circumcised? Can you imagine what his anus is like? Describe it to me. Would you like to sodomize him? Would you like to put your penis right into his anus, thrust it up his anus? Tell me, describe it to me. Tell me what you would do. How would you kiss him in that car? Describe how you'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans, then take out his penis. Would you kiss it or suck it right away? Which hand would you hold it in? Have you ever sucked a penis? Do you know what semen tastes like? Have you ever tasted semen? Some semen is saltier than others. Vaughan's semen must be very salty...
Have you seen his penis?
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
Do you find him attractive?
He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
Maybe I am a little.  James, I've got to leave for the office. Are you going to be all right?
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
Renata tells me you're going to rent a car.
No, I couldn't. I feel too close to her.
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
It is?
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
Outside in the visitors, car park.
He was a chemical engineer with a food company.
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
Well, yes.  You're getting out of bed tomorrow. They want you to walk.
Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. I forgot to tell you.
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
Not a lot of action here.
There, that's better.
Poor darling.  What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
Yes.  They felt like traffic accidents.
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
Yes.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me.
I work in the immigration department there.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
They said it was here. They told me this morning.
After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one?  I'm trying to find Charles's car.
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
Are you saying I'm through with therapy?
What?
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
I don't want to hear anymore.
Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on medication.
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
I miss Beast a lot, too.
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
Do we have to talk about this?
I don't think you understand.    I won't wait.
I want to see my mother immediately.
What kind of place is this?
What?
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
Yeah, and a dimple.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
I did this already.
I know.    I know.
I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans, Ruth.
I can't.    I can't see him there.
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
But what am I going to do?
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
I ruined your wedding night.
You did the right thing.
That's thanks to all your help.
I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
I didn't say...
What's his name, Letty?
Oh, no, of course not.
Do we have to talk wedding details?
And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print?
Ecru.
What do you think?
Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
You're slowing.
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate.
It'll be fine.
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
What's all the dreck?
What's the matter?
Fuck me.
What about the souffle?    Has that gone in?
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
How can I help?
Do you think I should?
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress.
Hi, Mom.
Truly.
Really?
You look beautiful.
What about this one?
Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
What about the engagement party?
Yeah, everything's under control.
But everything's OK?
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
I'd have to see it on.
What do you think of this one?
She said she'd be here at 10.
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
Yeah, it'll be fun.
And the party?
You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
Really?
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you crazy?
Please, Letty.
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
Maybe.
Maybe if we had them both to dinner or something.
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
How?
Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
There's nothing to tell.
Just go ahead and tell us.
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
What's up with you?
Just remember that I love him.
Don't be fresh.
I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
He's been looking everywhere for weeks, Mom.   It's not that easy after you've been locked away.
I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
A deal's a deal.
Honestly, Letty.
Not even if it's something positive?
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
I've already made arrangements.
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
It's good exercise, Mom.
Must you walk so quickly?
And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
I'm only looking out for you.
Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
Mom, please.
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
When did you start smoking?
I haven't had a crush since I was
Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
Which flowers did you order?
You're looking good.    A little thin, but good.
You too, Mom.
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
As soon as Dr. Emlee says.
Tomorrow?
I'll see you soon.
Paul said he'd call the school.  And your father thinks he's convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help.
And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
Ruth's already taken him home.
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
Yes.
We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
I gather he's late as usual.
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
Mom, please.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Oh no.
No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
You've only known Jake a few months.
Tell us every detail.
Wow.   Congratulations.
My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.
Come on.
Are you sure, Dear?
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
Will you get time off to do that?
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
I guess so. I think that's right.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
Lie?
Mottled really.   Green and red.
It had this red spot on its back.
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
There's a spider in my room.
I'm really not that hungry.
I guess I should go now.
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
I love you so much.
I know I don't want to lose you.     I don't think I could stand it.
What are we going to do?
Oh, God, Michael, I know.  Why does everything have to be so hard?
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
Well then why'd it happen?
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...
And all the plans we have.
It's hard to know where to start.
I guess we need to talk.
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
I think I should call someone.
Michael, take it easy.
I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly.
What do you mean not taking your meds?
We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
What?
What is it? Are you OK?
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
Bingo.
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
Congratulations.
I got worried. Are you OK?
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
The restaurant, too?
Are you OK?
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
You got wine. That's great.
Steak?
Promise?
Who ever said sanity was fun?
Yeah.    How was the job search?
I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
That's Mr. Beast to you.
Thanks.
Yeah?
Good luck.
I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
Not yet.
Michael.
Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
It's sex time.
You're so wrong.
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
I love your apartment.
Let's try out the bed.
It's TV heaven.
Very trendy. Let's see the rest.
I love the pillows.
Wow.
Open up.    I want to see.
I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
Aren't you ever quiet?
List schmist. You'll remember.
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
Furnished?
All over.  Did you see your new apartment?
Yeah.
Just checking.
And did you go to the mission?
So there were no problems?
Tell me all.
Well?
Great. I came to tell you to break a leg, and to give you this for good luck.
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
But I do.     I love you, too.
Michael, I...
Do you?
Your family just met me.
Lie down.
I don't like lamb.
I have a terrible confession.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
What else would you do?
No way.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
Break up?    They wish.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
What are the delusions like?
Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
Really?    Me too.
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
Don't be ridiculous.
We'll get caught.
We're supposed to be asleep.
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
Good God.
Really, this isn't funny.
The left one.
Enough with the abracadabra.
What have you done with the ring?
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
He asked me to marry him.
Paul.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
I wasn't hungry.
But you're checking it out.
Anything interesting.
I'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor. I'm not the one who's, who's...
You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
Who do you think you are?
You took bets on my diagnosis?
A while, I guess.
Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
By color.
Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
No.
Chair, cup and ball.
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
I answered these questions last night.
Letty.
Sure, I understand.
I'm really sorry.
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
Michael.   Yes.
What?
Getting back.
I start on Monday.
Oh.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
Here's the ring.
I love him.
He's a patient here.
No.
It doesn't matter who.
I've met someone else.
I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
No...
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
No, no.
No, you've done a perfect job.
It's, it's really nice, Paul.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
Especially now.
No.
Yes, I suppose so.
Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?
Something you did?
That's a big question.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
I'm going to the store.
Can you loan me a 20?
You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
Yeah.
I don't think so.
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.
No, it's not like that.
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
I don't feel like going to work today.
I'm calling in sick.
Sure. Of course.
Oh, ok.   Maybe.
I mean tonight.
Yeah?
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
Office work?
What does that mean?
I've already thought about how to tell the kids where I was.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.
I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
Zero.   That's all I know.
Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
I don't know.
I know they won't be home tonight.
No.    145 Ridgeroad Way.
Yes.
No, I didn't.
You can use my car.
There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
They don't have a wine list.
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
Stick around and find out.
After last night I could say the same for you.
Sounds boring.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
Can't sleep?
The lucky ones.
I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass.
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
You got it in a bar?
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
Did she break your heart?
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
They're not nice people.
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it.
You like shoes?
Take a nap.
Tonight.
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
I didn't have the heart.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
I owe you nothing.
Shut up!
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
I'll never live as a thief!
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
He is my defeated foe!
So what if I don't?
Don't bother.
Long.
I have a guest.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
I'm tired now.
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
Do you know her?
Put them down.
Please sit.
Spare your energy.  I'll be back!
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!
She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.
You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Come and get it if you can.
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
What do I care?  You were never a real friend anyway.  But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
Where is he now?
He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
You know about Lo?
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
They forced me to marry!
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
You, sister...
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
I'll give them to you.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
Here you must be in proper attire.
Yes, from the West.  He went undercover and and followed her here,
You say she killed a policeman?
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
No, really?
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
About you and Li Mu Bai?
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
Please.
Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.
You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
You're doing calligraphy?
I'm bored.
How so?
I've missed you.
You're probably right.
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
What do you think?
You're not married, are you?
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
Really?
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
You're a sword fighter too?
You're too young to understand.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
Never!
Give it back!
All right.  If you can take back the sword in three moves, I'll go with you.
What do you want?
Only the sword will settle this.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Make a wish, Lo.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
Don't ever come back.
Go.
If you don't, I'll come after you. And I won't let you off so easy.
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
Don't send me back!
Let them look.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
Give it back.
Give me back my comb.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
You coward!
My comb!
Give it back!
You shouldn't have come.
Lo?
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
Save your strength.
Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope...
That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this?
We followed Jade Fox.
What happened?
Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
What about you?
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
Don't you want to see her again.
You think Jade Fox will show up?
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
But Wudan does not accept women.
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
I knew she would intrigue you.
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
Then, why did you come?
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
No, not yet...
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
No.
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
But something is going on at the Yu household.
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
So what will you do now?
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te?
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
What was it?
You were enlightened?
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
Good.  And how are you?
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.
But the sword could be in his compound.
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
I don't know...
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
I know.
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
You didn't show it to anybody?
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
You what?
I have his journal.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
You heard me.
Excuse me?
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Thank you.
Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine.
I'll be fine.
Are you okay?
I'm sure you're going to love it there.
That's right.
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
You might say that.
Did you know Sebastian well?
I don't think so.
Have we met?
Annette Harrison.
I'm Kathryn.
Okay...
You promise not to say anything?
Forever.
I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
What do you mean?
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
Nothing.
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
But you knew this was important to me.
You don't know how to love.
Why are you trying to hurt me?
I love you.
What are you saying?
Yeah, me neither.
Would you like a tour?
Hi.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --
Hi.
Please don't go.
How am I a hypocrite?
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
I think that's for the best.
Where are you going?
It's because I don't trust myself with you.  I took a vow and because of you I'm tempted to break it. Don't destroy that for me. Please.
You really want to know?
That's not fair.
I have feelings for you.
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
Why are you doing this?
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
Not at all. Have a seat.
No?
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
Fine.
Lighten up.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
You must take me for a real idiot.
"I actually feel good about myself?"
Oh please.
Okay.
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
I'm doing some volunteer work.
Sure. Have a good night.
You're not gonna start that again.
Somerset Maugham.
What are you reading?
What are you doing?
Wait, don't hang up.
It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.
I'm... I'm alright.
No, not at all.
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
And you promise to abide by it?
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
That's also none of your business.
I'm busy.
That's none of your business.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
You don't even know me.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
And that's a bad thing?
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
It was fine.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
Give it up.
No thank you.
That's repulsive.
You're naked.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
Because you act like a pig.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
Shut up.
Thank you.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
I never said that.
About what?
How's the water?
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
I sincerely doubt it.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
At this hour? I don't think so.
You need help.
Romantic? He rapes her.
You've read The Fountainhead?
The Fountainhead.
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
Why are you being so dramatic?
It's not really important.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
A friend wrote me.
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
You did?
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
No.
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
No.
Junior.
German.
Ben Schwarz.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Doctor King is my favorite.
Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
Okay.
I'm in the bath, mom.
Those are my letters!
Where did you find those?
What are the boys like?
Cool.
That's one way of looking at it.
It's like a secret society.
Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it.
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
I am?
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
I did?
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one.
Well did you like it?
What do I do then?
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
If that's what you call it.
Well what then?
No.
He made you give him a blow job.
Well... not exactly.
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
I don't know.
Why didn't you do something?
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Does your mother know?
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
I... I don't think you want to know.
What do you mean?!
Something awful happened last night.
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
It's Kathryn.
Who is it?
Best friends.
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
You'd do that for me?
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
Why?
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
Did you hide the letters?
Okay.
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
I don't know.
Well do you like him?
No.
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
Is it that obvious?
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
What are you saying?
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
That was cool.
Eyes closed.
Okay.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
It was nothing.
See that wasn't so bad.
I guess. It still sounds gross.
Do you want to learn or not?
Are you for real?
It's not gross. How else do you think girls learn? Here turn around and face me.
Eww. No. That's gross.
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
What are you scared of?
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
That's great.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
What was that?
Prude.
Want a blow job?
Need any company?
Where are you going?
Is it me?
I'm sorry.
I like it better when I'm on top.
Am I suppose to be this sore?
Want to join me?
But -
What are you doing?
Just a kiss, right?
And then I can go home?
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
I want to go home.
I want to go home.
I look terrible.
What are you doing?
You think he'll like it?
But I thought high school is only four years.
What year are you in?
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
Would you please leave.
Good luck, Sebastian.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
My daughter, Rachel.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
No. This is going to be our last session.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
Don't you want to change that?
But you said you have the worst reputation.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
Who told you?
Honey, is something wrong?
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
No.
It's Kathryn.
Ronald?
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
Likewise I'm sure.
I think you have your answer.
And if I don't?
Get out!
Didn't you hear what I said?
I accept. Now get out.
Fine! Get off me!
Get off me!
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard.  Cheers.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
To my triumph, of course.
Well done.
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
Well done.
Annette?
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, "How do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up."  Poor fatty never had a chance.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
Why so nervous?
Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
Is that what you think?
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.
I want to fuck.
And that's why you're leaving?
Excuse me?
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
No, tell me.
Oh come on. For her first time?
Tell me all the details.
You didn't?
Kind of.
She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends.  You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
So what went wrong?
She shot you down.
Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus?
So? How'd it go last night?
Morning!
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
And that's why you're losing your bet?
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
What's your problem?
Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley.  Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset by the big bad book.
That her?
Who are you spying on?
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
I'm aware.
Cecile.
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
Have you succeeded in your task?
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
No.
Interesting.
What's wrong with you?
Shhh.
Call me later.
Loser.
Fuck her yet?
It would feel so yummy.
You can put it anywhere.
Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
I'll think about it...
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
Jesus Christ, is she for real?
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
Why not?
She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
I don't find this very funny,
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
You will be discreet about this?
I know. She's so young and he's so -
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
It's Cecile.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
You're too kind.
I'll do my best.
How?
I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
It's been ages since I've even thought of a mummers' play. When I was in college we used to do them every year  St. George and the Dragon, all kinds of sword dances.
I love the smell of pine.
No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
Yes. As a matter of fact, I was on the point of telling you about it yesterday  about Oliver's first marriage  and his wife's death. It has so much to do with Amy  although he'll never realize it.
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
Oh, hello.
I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us.
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
Oh, thank you, darling.
All right, mommy.
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
Irena.
Irena.
What's her name?
She was very pretty.
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
Where'd you get this, darling?
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
Sh! Then you must keep it true. Goodnight, darling.
But it's already come true.
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
I got my wish anyway.
Well  the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
I really don't know, but I do know that you must return the ring. You get Edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady.
Are they nice?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
Do you know the people?
The Farren house
On the back street  a green house
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
At the old house with the voice.
But where did you get it, Amy?
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
Where did you get this ring?
I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would.
Sometimes.
Did your wishes ever come true?
Oh, lots of times.
Did you ever make a wish?
Yes, darling.
Mommy --
Oh, you'll remember it some time.
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
What song, dear?
I suppose any note, no matter how sour, is a song if you hold on to it long enough.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
What are saying, darling?
I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself  tell the truth --
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
You get your wish!
Oliver, please. Let's not go on with this. The child's trembling.
What's funny?
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
Well, you know where it is.
It's your play.
Ollie.
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
You're shouting at me.
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
Did you hear the child out?
My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
What do you mean?
That's right.
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
Times have changed.
Yes, darling,
It's early yet.
I forgot I had it on.
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today  let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
You do that, Edward.
But I told her to go with you.
That's the Farren house.
I thought you were with Amy.
I got lots of presents.
I live right here.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
Mommy's having a party for me. I asked Robert, and Donald, and Lois --
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
Tell me tha real truth. You can see my friend, can't you?
Daddy?
She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
But...
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
Don't you see her?...Right there, under the tree.
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
She's there whenever I call her!
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
Because she is my friend.
Why, daddy, you know my friend too!
Daddy!
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
Just you wait!
These are all from me.
You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
No, I didn't.
Daddy, it's true.
It was just a voice.
It's true.
I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
They ran away.
It was on account of the birthday party.
But I didn't play with them, Daddy.  They wouldn't play with me.
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
But wishes don't come true.
I didn't forget.
Yes, daddy.
I'll show you.
Yes, I did.
Yes, daddy.
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
No.
I don't know yet.
Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
But why?
Yes, Amy.
You?
But, Amy!  Amy...I'm dead.
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
But she's dead!
You mustn't be afraid.
She's dead! I know what it is now when people say somebody died. I know what they mean! And I'm afraid. She's dead; she's dead!
Don't cry, Amy.
It's you...Irena...my friend!
I want to touch it.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
May I pet the deer?
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong  warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
It stands so still.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, please!
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
I shall wear it in my hair!
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
Oh, how beautiful!
You can open it now, I guess. Lois Huggins says that's proper,
Oh, thank you, Amy.
Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.
Oh, but the winter's fun. There's the wind and the snow. You'll like the warm fire upon the hearth, and the long, long nights.
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
My dolls. We can pretend.
Your children?
No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead.  You be the friend who comes to see me.  I'll show you my children.
Pretend, darling.  It's All Soul's Eve.  Round about the fire we go...  Over the flames we leapt
But we don't have any sea weed.
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
That one's an elm.
There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.
Of course,
This is more fun than just pretend.
That's right!
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
A princess?
Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
The numbers simply don't mean anything
But you must!
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
Can't you get it, darling?
Whenever you want.
You'll always play with me?
Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
I shall want you for always.
For as long as you'll let me.
Will you be friend for always?
I can not tell you.
But where is that?
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
But where do you come from?
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
I've wanted a friend.
I'm your friend.
Irena. But who are you?
You called me by my name.
Who are you?
But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
But what happened to the little deer?
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
But she's such a nice lady.
But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
That means I can go alone?
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
Will you come soon?
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
I wasn't singing to myself.
I'm trying to.
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
It's a pretty ring.
A lady threw it to me.
Look at my ring.
Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
I can't do it! I can't do it!
Hurry!
Yes, yes -
Hurry, hurry.
My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
Hide me? Why?
No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
And does he kill people?
Don't you read Shakespeare?
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
Don't you hear it?
What?
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
Good.
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
It was shot off long ago in the great battles that were fought here; with the British on one side and the Americans on the other.
Why hasn't he got a head?
The Headless Horseman --
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
Mommy read it to ne.
Then I'll tell you a story  a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
I like stories.
One little piece of cake won't hurt you. Go ahead, take one. It's full of fruit...citron, cherries and ginger. It'll make you dream. Yes, wonderful dreams.
No, thank you.
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
That woman is an imposter, a liar, and a cheat. How do you like your tea? </PRE><PRE>                                AMY Well... .sometimes I got a spoonful of tea in a cup of hot milk.
Who is she?
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me  always!
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
But I only came to give back the ring.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days  those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
Return it to me? Indeed you may not. I gave it to you as a present.
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
Good night...Barbara...
Good night, mother, good night.
I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
Mother! You called me by name!
It was pale...a shadowed gold.
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
Yes...yes, that's true.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
Anybody could know that song.
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
I hate the storm. I hate it!
My daughter died long ago.
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
Look at me.
My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you.
Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.

Wait a minute. Listen.
That's from her -- that woman.
...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
On the dark nights  on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.
Let the child stay.
Never felt better.
I've been working out.
What?
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
No.
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
I've changed a lot lately.
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
Does she have PMS?
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
Nearly four.
It's not just in my head.
What else is there?
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
Good. Except for PMS.
No, it was another woman.
Oh, on my wrist.
There was a sale.
At Victoria's Secret.
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
What does that have to do with me?
Mom!
Jennifer?
Sure. See ya.
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
Frida? You okay?
Hello?
Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
I wish I only had your problems.
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
I thought you and George were getting married.
No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with.
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
About Benito.
About Mark? Carlton?
I think George knows.
The werewolf always dies at the end. Didn't you see "American Werewolf in London?"
No. I won't let you do that.
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
I guess you'll find out.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
I'm cleaning my stove.
I think I already have.
Fall in love.
So what do I do?
What choice do we have?
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
Guess she never found true love.
She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
Check out what I found.
"Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
We don't know you're a werewolf. It might never happen again. You have to get on with your life.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
Peter keeps asking me out.
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
You're such a good friend.
Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
I think I just got my period.
Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
Peter knows something.
Hide him.
What the fuck are we going to do?
Tell them you'll meet them outside.
Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.
Ignore it.
No.
You expecting someone?
You should have seen it erect.
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
Okay, let's say that this is PMS- related. You think those male cops are going to understand that? You'll either be locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin. We have to keep this hidden until we figure it out ourselves.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
I could smell another woman on him.
Why the fuck would you do that?
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
What? Why'd you do that?
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
Why not? There's been a murder.
DON'T call the police.
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
What happened to his tooth?
Yeah, I guess. Mark?
He's been here all night?
I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
Did you get rid of Mark?
Holy shit, I don't know.
I'm stopping by later. I'm worried about you. Bye.
Okay, I gotta go.
Get rid of him!
Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
And he was missing an arm.
Oh no.
Frida, Carlton's dead.
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Tuesday. Are you okay?
I've been here. What day is it?
Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
Hello?
I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
I haven't gotten it yet.
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.
You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
And what makes you think you killed a man?
I put it down the garbage disposal.
So where's this infamous arm now?
Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
There is a man's arm in my bed.
Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
I look like fuckin' Chewbacca.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
No they're not.
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
No you don't, believe me.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
I still thought it was a purse.
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
It is so hot in here.
Charming Carlton.
Oh my god. I've never had that before. I've had guys say they want me to suck their dicks and gross stuff but no one's ever said "Hey there beautiful."
I think he called you beautiful.
What did he say?
You're just saying that.
Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
Great. George is meeting Carlton first for drinks. We can meet and go together. It'll be a blast.
Okay. I guess so.
No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us.
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
How'd it go with the cop?
I looked like an Italian man!
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy.
You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
What the hell is the tampon test?
Give him the tampon test.
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not judging you... You didn't sleep with the creep did you?
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
I wonder if he's married.
Rule one: always wear make-up.
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
Uh huh... good thing those cops didn't see that.
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
Are those Mark's?
My vision got worse again.
I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
And my bra finally fits again.
At least your PMS is over.
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
And then?
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
What? Why the hell did he do that?
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
No. I don't think so.
No, did you fuck him?
Did I kill him? Of course not!
So did you do it?
To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
Why would they exaggerate?
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
Hey, did you get contacts?
You are not Frida, we all have a little hair there. I didn't even notice till you showed me. We can bleach that, it's no big deal.
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
Where?
They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
Maybe they have to pee.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away...
George bit you?
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
I think she broke the skin.
Even on sale that stuff's a fortune. I worked all week to pay for a bra.
And she got the medium.
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
Frida, grab that red one.
Where are all the mediums?
There's a sale. It's such a nice place -- classical music, relaxing atmosphere. You deserve to pamper yourself. Come on, it can't hurt.
I don't know.
It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
Or if there's a full moon.
Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
Can't you get contacts?
Only to see.
Do you really need these?
You're just saying that.
How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.
I'd kill for just a little bloated.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
Maybe he's just shy.
He hasn't said one word to me.
People notice you Frida.
I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
So don't look in his eyes.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
He's a very talented musician.
Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
My shrink says he's not so bad.
Anything's better than Mark.
Translation: a total geek.
Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to see it -- that's what this is all about, right?
Uh huh. So pee.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
You don't have to pee.
Oh come on. Knock it off.
My apartment's just such a mess.
You should have gone at the restaurant.
What?
Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
I'm really tired.
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
That's great. Highly original.
I'm not really hungry after all.
Starving.
You're kidding, really?
I do development for TV movies.
I know.
Take your shower.
Mark.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
So pay them back and apologize.
This really isn't a good time.
It's Mark.
Where'd you get the bike?
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
Yeah right... You better go.
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
I can't help it, it smells so good.
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
No.
You never say that.
Since when do you care?
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
No.
Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
A little.
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
Your desk.
On your desk.
On your desk.
Here's a towel.
Okay.
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
What about... those guys... I might have...
Worse than this?
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
Be careful!
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
How do you know?
Peter I love you too but...
Go away. I might hurt you.
I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!
No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
Hello?
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
They do? Oh no...
I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
I love you too.
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
No, my bite's a lot worse.
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
Interesting possibility.
No, but thanks for the warning.
What's that supposed to mean?
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
What happened?
No, I got it. It's okay.
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
No, why?
But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be down in a second.
Uh.... hi!
Everything okay?
NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
No. Nope, nothing in it.
I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today.
Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
My period? No.
What's wrong?
Okay, you busted me.
What are they for?
What are those?
Goodnight.
Yeah. Maybe.
I really gotta get going.
He's bad news. He cheated on me, he insults me. Now suddenly he gets jealous if I have a date.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
How about you? Briefs or boxers?
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
Like what?
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
Oh my god, by wolves?
I'm sorry.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
It's stupid.
Oh, it's nothing.
No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
Intriguing?
Are you following me?
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
We didn't have sex.
I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
I ate a guy last night.
I think I'm a werewolf.
That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
No, I have a cat.
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
What makes you think I was the last one?
Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
No, take it.
No, I said it was our first date.
No, it was our first date.
Yes... I... we had dinner.
Oh my god, what happened?
She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
Take some allergy medicine.
Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
Tell her I'm eating.
So now being with Frida is lucky? I thought you said she was a flake.
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger...
See he was cheating from the get go.
I don't know, I guess the outfits are cool. And I want a big gun.
I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
You want her sheets?
How the hell is that your business?
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
Yeah... It could be fun.
Oh... I lived with a President.  It isn't any fun.
So this is it?
... Me, too.
I know.
Yeah, well... It's finally over.
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
Hi.
Yeah.   He's a good man.
I sure fall for some weird guys.
You really believe that?
They're crucifying you out there.
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
I can't.
Yeah... Bedtime.
It was inspirational.
But you could go to jail for it.
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
You find people jobs?
Yes.
So what do you do the rest of the time?
You have a lot of secrets.
I really don't have much of an appetite.
What?
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
I lock at you and I see Bill...  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
It's just so strange...
Oh... Okay.
Thanks.
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
You sure this goes somewhere?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
You1re leaving, too?
Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
Home.
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
I'm sure they did.  'State of Emergency.'  'National Security.' You ever hear of the Constitution?
When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates.
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
You weren't in the state legislature.
Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
Oh, I don't think so.  Still, you helped a lot of people.
That was quite a thing you did today.
Mind if I sit down?
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
You made their funding disappear!
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
Oh, come on, Bill.  Don't patronize me.   I'm not one of your little...  Turn around.  I'm talking to you!... Turnaround!
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
Since when do you care about the homeless?
You don't change, do you, Bill?
Don't you have anything to say to me?
I'm outta here.
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
What are you staring at?
Come on.
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
Look.
What is it?
No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know.  Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
Help me get him to the boat.
How long do we have to watch him?
It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we landed our boat.
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
What?
Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
No. They just try to hold you for ransom. Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here!
I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.
Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
Curse?
The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
Gasparilla?
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
Knox?!
Chet...
Don't stop.
You know,
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
It's all right, Chet.
I have to go home. Chet might call.
What is that?
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
God, if Chet found out he'd...
Uh-huh.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
Just like that?!  You just knew?
You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
Knox, I don't believe this!
Knox, you're crazy.
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
Knox!  what are you doing here?
Huh?
I gotta find Chet.  Make yourself at home.
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
Oh, hi.  I'm glad you made it.  Did you bring anybody?
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Hello?
You going out for the Henley Hall play?  They're doing "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
That's your sister school, right?
Ridgeway High.  How's Henley Hall, Gin?
Pleased to meet you.
Where's you friend?
I don't take orders at all.
No...
Soon as I get over the heart attack...
And what if I run into one of those things?
You want ME to go up there?
How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right?
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
...the minute you start your engines ...it's goint to kill us, isn't it?
Finnegan...
Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there?
What?
I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...
So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?
You should talk...
We can't just leave them here.
What is it?
What's the matter?
You're saying they can think?
How do you know that?
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
Right... You have a boat.
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
I don't know where it is!
Takes one to know one.
Self sufficient...
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
Seen a lot of islands?
So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
Thank you, I work at it...
I'm not rich people.
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
You don't have to be so touchy.
But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
What are those things?
Noooo!
You hear that?
What are you people talking about?
Then who are you?
The thieves.
Who asked you to!
Now look what you did!
I'm not staying here!
Why don't you back off?
Nowhere...
A passenger...
Poolside?
Or maybe not.
I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine.
I'm just so lonely.
I don't know.
That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air.
I see you're going hunting.
You're going hunting?
What are you doing?
Nick?
Nick. It's okay... It's okay.  I have to go now.
No-o-o!
Oh, it's great. Fine.
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
I made you a sweater.  Here... You have to take that off.
But --
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
How are you?
Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so!
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!
I don't know.
Sure.
I don't know! I don't know either!
Okay.
What?
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because...
Oh... You know...
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
That's my problem, Belle.
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
I didn't.
He lied to me again.
Thank you, Belle --
No, thank you -- what's your name?
Jabez -- ?
All right, darling.
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
Daniel, you ought to be in bed.
Daniel! ...  I've stood just about as much as I can bear!
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
Jabez -- Jabez!
All right, Jabez ...
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
Jabez!
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
I don't know, Jabez.
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
But Jabez, I never said that!
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
I am going to lock him up.
Nothing, Jabez -- just natural for a baby to cry, sometimes.  Shh, little Daniel -- sleep -- sleep --
Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --
Don't be cross with him, Ma. This don't happen every day.
Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined.
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
I'll never get my washing done.
Oh -- Jabez.
I'll get it, Jabez.
Jabez --
Don't take cold, Jabez.  Come -- it's warm in here.
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
You'll never change -- will you?
Worried!
But I'm glad to be home again --
Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
We must go on home, Jabez.
What do you think of that, Jabez?
I'd love to.
It feels fine now, Jabez.
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
Jabez!
No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
Jabez ...
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
Jabez!
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
Not all of it?
Do you think I'm grudging it?
We can still use my butter money.
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
Who is it?
He's stubborn as a Stone.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
Oh, Jabez.
Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
Jabez -- help!
I won't forget.
You aren't angry with me?
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
What mountain?
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
I'll try hard -- I just can't take it all in.
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
I guess we won't.
Coming, Ma.
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
Jabez ...
Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
Of course not --
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
-- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
It is.
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
No!
Maybe...
Oh.  Run.
What'll you do?  Come out.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
I said you were never a faggot.
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
<i>I once vowed never to invest too much emotion into anyone, anything.</i>
What is it, Choco?
Who the hell is that?
<i>Choco grew up on the streets of El Salvador. When he was four years old... he stabbed another kid in the eye-ball with a pencil.</i>  <i>There were wires crossed somewhere in his soul.</i>
Morning.
I've been training since I was twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it... I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die.
Okay.
What!!?
You're breaking up... I can't hear you.
<i>What happened to them?</i>
Why the hell are we delivering them out here? I can't even find any warrants in the system for these four.
I became a bounty hunter because of cunts like you.  I remember all the cunts in high school who were mean to me. Eventually... they all grew up to be just like you. Angry and bitter because they peaked early... and now they're stuck in some dead end marriage... or worse yet... an unfulfilling job that keeps them from meeting a man.
Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
Take us to Vegas. <b> EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY </b> The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table.
<i>Now the bitch was getting personal.</i>
Take us to Vegas.
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
<i>The bitch was bluffing. There were no dupe tapes. If there were... they'd have shown them to me by now.</i>
<i>Her car was in the shop.</i>
We needed to verify some bond certificates for Claremont. She pushes stuff through the system for us... helps us track down perps for a kick back. It's all legal. <b> INT. MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE -- [FLASHBACK] DAY </b>
That's the rumor on the street.
He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.
He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
Yes.
You're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself... and it's not working. I said I'd tell you everything I know. You and your friends behind the mirror.
I don't know.
<i>Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.'</i>
<i>Mescaline.</i> <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NIGHT </b> Domino and the others are all drinking coffee. Alf stares out through the windshield at the GLOW of Vegas in the distance.
<i>Either this was some kind of set up... or the First Ladies got scared... decided to pull out and cut their losses.</i>
Is that the decoder?
Turn over your weapon, Edna!
HE'S STILL ALIVE, EDNA!
Nice to see you again, Edna.
Chi-Chi has gone to doggie heaven, bitch!
<i>That's my best friend. His name is Choco. He's always fancied me... but too shy to ever do anything about it.</i>
<i>It was the beginning of the end.</i>
He used to date Pat Benatar!
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
Cunt. It's just a word. Why does everyone in this fucking country get their knickers in a twist by the slightest bit of indecent conversation?
Cunt.
Cunt.
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
Everything. It is a ghastly existence.
<i>After dad passed on, Mum's agenda was to hit the town and find another husband with a boatload of cash.</i> <b> INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- EVENING </b> Sophie is dolled up for a night on the town... CLEAVAGE spilling out of her cocktail dress. Domino is feeding her pet GOLDFISH. "THUNDERBIRDS" plays on the television.
Then so be it. If you believe what that Indian said we were fucked either way.
<i>Turned out Edna. had one last trick up her sleeve.</i> <b> INT. FENDER COMPOUND -- KITCHEN -- [FLASHBACK] TEN MINUTES AGO
He said... take his right arm.
Something is going down. Something bad.
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
Where are the bond certificates for the First Ladies?
You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances?
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
You're wearing eyeliner. You look like a queen.
Hello?
<i>I was asleep in mum's guest house.</i> <b> INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings.
<i>Mum was terrified for me. She didn't approve of my lifestyle one bit.</i>
How did you meet Choco?
Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!
I... <i>love...</i> Pat Benatar.
Really? Did you play in a band?
So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter?
No last names. Just Domino. The less you know about me the better, okay?
You can save that Pretty Woman shit. The name is Domino.
Because I want justice. I want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong.  And I want to have a little fun.
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
<i>My real father was an actor. He died when I was a little girl.</i>
I can certainly think of one more!
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
Did you ask Sal?
And?
So?
What did he do this time?
That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
I truly hope so.  I'm tired of supporting a grown man.
...peanuts.
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.
You are too crude.
I didn't stutter.  You heard me.
He's completely innocent.
He's just being nice.
What are you so worked up about?
Stop tripping.
See ya around.
I'll see ya there.
No.
I'm going with you.
Hurry up and get dressed.
I didn't stutter.  Take care of your responsibilities.  Y'know exactly what I'm talking about.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.
Sal's gonna be mad.
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
How come you're not at Sal's?
I'm in here.
Do me a favor.  Go to work.
Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?
Whew!
And move to Long Island...
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
How are you holding up in this weather?
Sorry, comb got caught.
Yeah, me too.
This might take some time.
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?
You're to the curb.  You better step off.  Get a life.
Act like one then.  Be a man.
Be a man.
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
Where are you going?
Feels good.
What?
Later for you.
It's cold.
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
What else?
You a blue-moon fool.
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
How long then?
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
Your memory is really getting bad.
Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan?
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
Come in then.
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?
When?
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
I work too, but I still make time.
Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here.
What? No! Look.
Okay, what?
What are you wearing?
What?
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
HARRY? Are you okay?
Just down the hall.
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school, and I think they've been doing it for years.
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
Would you like something to drink?
Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal.
Yeah...
Come over around seven.
You and Lloyd chose the class!?
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
You did?
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
HARRY!
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.
Hey guys.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Excuse me.
Hi.
I wouldn't know. Being that I'm just the teacher and all.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
I thought I told you to get lost.
You mean the lunch room?
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
Oh, you're good.
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
No.
So can I come along?
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
That's not your tape.
I don't know what you're talking about.
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
And, Ching Chong, you're not a Special Needs kid. You're just a foreign exchange student.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
TURK, what are you doing here?
TURK, leave him alone.
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
Thanks, Lloyd. But I didn't find what I was looking for. Oh can you do me a favor and clean up? Collins can't know we were here.
That's my boyfriend.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
That's it. I'm done.
I'm so close I can feel it.
Let's just do it and get out of here.
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
Well, something stinks.
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
So, when can we do it?
So could you get us into the principal's office?
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
What?
Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's just about to open up.
What are you doing here?
Well I was born in St. Louis.
Yes, what?
This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
Oh no, I know that class isn't for me. But I'm happy for you guys.
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
I'll talk to you later.
So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
That's not bad. How about a float of George Washington crossing the Delaware?
People! Come on. "Parade" float.
No.
Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.
What the hell are you talking about?
I think you did it.
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
Left here! Left!
That's great, now make a left, then straight!
Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!
What?
Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
This is horse?
Love it!
This band sounds terrible.
So the chest is still out there somewhere.
Are you going to kill her?
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
Where is it?
The evidence of what?
What papers?
Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
Oh, just like the President.
Everything?
So what do you keep in there?
Monkey, this is too exciting! I can't believe our dream is coming true.
You got the Extender?
It's a surprise.
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
Knock knock.
Wow, you are smart.
And...?
To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
Times two.
Oh wow. Look at you.
You said "aloha" twice.
We start our own class?
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
It's the big potato.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
God, I've missed you.
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
Yes, my Lord.
I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord.
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
We felt his presence.
You mustn't speak of...
Stop him, Jessica!
They tried and died.
... Many men have tried.
What can be done has been done.
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
They tried and died....  Jessica!
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!
You feel the flesh crisping?
SILENCE... SILENCE.
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
Pain.
Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie.  Now that it's done, so am I.
I'm tired of living on the fringe.
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
I'm going to my mother's.
You're a fuckin' mess.
That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
I told you this was gonna happen.
Like <u>what</u>?!
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
All I know is, ever since "Glen Or Glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
That's ridiculous.
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
Toss us out on our ass.
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
I don't know.  It's so much money...
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
Oh, just like in the script!
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
Oh!  You got nerve, buddy.
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?!  What kind of sick mind would operate like that?
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
How long have you been doing this?
Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
So did you get his autograph?
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
I thought he was dead.
You met Basil Rathbone!
Boris Karloff!?
Who?  Robert Taylor?!
Better than not getting a job?
You got the job?!!
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
Ed, it was only one review.
What?
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
Huh?!
Ed, I'm so happy for you.
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
My chiropractor!
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
You should feel lucky.  Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
The poor girl's out of a job.
The sun.
Dynamite --
Uh, atomic energy?
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
Well you tried --
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
What was that?
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
STOP!
Oh.  Okay.
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
Huh?
A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live.  I thought he was much scarier in person.
That <u>is</u> incredible!  You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie.
"Dracula."
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.
Oh.  I loved those shows!  "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" --
Did you find it boring?
Sounds like you lived in Grovers Corners.
So have you always lived in L.A.?
They're very nice.  Let me get my coat.
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
You look beat.
Oh, it's you again.
This is my thirteenth pair.
Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
Oh.  My condolences.
Oh.  Congratulations.
Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
I don't think so.
Yeah? Well I'm not starting now.
Ed --
Ed --
Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --
Pursued, not harassed. Give it some space. Can I tell you something -- as a friend? My sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child For what it's worth.
Leave her be.
Ed, do you want my advice?
Great line.
Yeah.
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
A woman wants to be pursued.
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
Uh-huh?
How you doing, Ed?
Good idea.  Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes?
Yes, Ed.
I do.
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
I want you to take this.
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
Ed, can I see you a second.
What did you study?
I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
Good luck.
I'm telling you, it's peaked. Ed TV is an over-inflated balloon. Get it off before it explodes all over us.
Take him off the air.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
He's who we want to go with.
I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy!
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
Ed! How did you know I was here?
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Oh my god! On TV!
To you? In front of him?  With the...
What?
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
It was horrible. He called me up.
St. Joseph's.
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
I'm at the hospital.
Eddie...
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
And what did he come back now for?
He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
What's the difference?
She had white shoes.
She could've been a nurse.
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
I don't care what he says. Look, I don't need to relive this. On television!
He had girlfriends!
Both.
Yes.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
I can't believe you're taking his side.
Oh my God!!
Oh my God!
Mm.
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
He made a mistake.
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
No. It's a mess.
No.
Send him away.
Are the TV people with you?
Eddie? ...
So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
What do we have to do?
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
This is going right up your ass.
Everybody's someone.
What?
The what?
No... Could you?
No. It's your fault.
...yeah?
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
Are you all right?
Okay.
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
Where?
I'm sorry.
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
Ed?
There's a list.
Twenty-nine.
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
Page three of the Post.
Look at this.
Everybody hates me!
I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month!
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
... yeah, then, but...
I really like you too...
I know, I ...
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
Um...
Why?
That's lucky.
Oh yeah.
The what?
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Yeah, well...
What are you doing?
Oh God, this is so weird.
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
Really?
Go!
Leave. Go.
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Oh my God.
Really?
I mean bad.
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
Ha!
Don't defend that horse's ass to me.
What do you want?!
Right.
Dynamite is dangerous.
So?
Cream rinse?
Why do it?
Are you sure about this?
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Yeah...
By the X. That's were two lines cross -- forming an X.
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
By the X.
Sign here, please.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
Thank you.
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
what?
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
I hope so
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
Take as much room as you want
Would you sign it for me?
I just have to get something. I'll be right back.
I want you to do something for me.
My house.
I've got an idea.
Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?
Doing what?
Yes?
That sounds good.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Where to?
Sporty.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
I'm looking at new cars.
Hello, Mr. M.
Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.
I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
What do you mean?
Yes?
And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
Why are you lecturing me?
well, I don't know.  It could have been anybody.  There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard.  You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken - what about him?  Or what about Tammy Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
Thanks for everything.
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
Here they are.
I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Ethics are...
I know.
Thanks, Mr. M.
You know what they say about the early bird.
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
I was lonely.  You took advantage
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
Yeah.  I'm here.
What do you want, Jim?
Three twenty-five.
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
Hey Yeah?
Yep.
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
Dave.
Oh.
Should we get a what?
You sure?
I can't afford this stuff right now.
More this way.
Could you get this? I can't
Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
Thanks.  You too.  It was great working with you.
Yes, Paul?
Can I sign yours too?
Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
Yeah.
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Yeah.
Okay, Mr. Popular.  You're on.
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
Thought what?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Who put you up to this?
Who put you up to this?
In the morning.
We talked.
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want.
Do you like being a cop, Bud?
So you saved her.
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
No.  I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  And that's all the news that's fit to print.
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
But you did it anyway.
Did they deserve it today?
Do you enjoy it?
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
You say 'fuck' a lot.
I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
It's Lynn.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Yes.  But do you know?
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Of course I am.  What kind of question is that?
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
Can I get you a drink?
It's not what you think.
It's practically stamped on your forehead.
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
Right now, before I back down.
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
I know how he feels.
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
The way you've underestimated Bud White?
It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
I'm curious about you.
He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
For that matter, I think you will too.
I think she'll like this very much.
Remain calm.
I'll be right back.
What size?
What size?
It's a little late for that.
Very good.
How 'bout Christian Dior?
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
That's fine.
Do you see anything you like?
My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
You're a moron, you know that?
What makes you think it's you?
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
This conversation's over.
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
I've never met him?
I can't.
How?
We're screwed.
Bullshit.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
For the last four years.
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
I gotta go.
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
Good. You're just what I need right now.
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!
I got a call from my firm this morning saying don't come in.
Eat your fish.
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
You're not.
He doesn't work that way.
Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
Other than me.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
Yes.
It's how he works.
What answer were you--
Never.
DePinto?
Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--
Do you like fish?
It is fish.
How's the trout?
Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France.  The Devil's Chimney it was called -  The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why.  Darling.  My darling.
I know.
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
Do you promise?  I wouldn't want to die here.  I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns.  Very English.  And I know exactly where I want to be buried.  In our garden.  Where I grew up. With a view of the sea.  So promise me you'll come back for you.
Oh dear.
Shall we be all right?
Don't leave me!
It's so cold.
Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it. I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.
You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
Why did you hate me?
It hurts too much.
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
A surprise, he said.
I can't move.  I can't get out.
Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
No.
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
Don't do this.
Would you let me pass?
What?
You will.  You will.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
Shall we be all right?
That day, had you followed me to the market?
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
You bastard, I was believing you!
It's beautiful.  What's it about?
Arabic?
This is - what is this?
This is empty, just coming!
No.
What?  No!
A lie.  What do you hate most?
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almásy nods.
What do I love?  I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths.
Now.
Now.
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
You sew very badly.
I'm impressed you can sew.
Don't.
Will you please come in?
Will you not come in?
Do they know them?
No, the marriage isn't a fiction.
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Oh my God, the others!
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.
Shall we be all right?
This is not very good, is it?
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
What am I looking at?
I'm quite all right, thank you.
And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
I'd like you to have them.
I thought you might paste them into your book.
Ask Al Auf. Almásy asks Al Auf in Arabic.
You sing.  All the time.
Actually, you sing.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
What do you mean, poetry?
So why follow me?  Escort me, by all means.  Following me is predatory, isn't it?
You felt obliged to.
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
Why did you follow me yesterday?
Excuse me.
I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
I don't care to bargain.
I don't want to go back.
Excuse me?
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
Hello!  Good morning.
Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women.  Do you all know this story?
I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
How are you?
I can get in the back.
Buon' giorno.
What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
I think that's called looting.
Where did you find that?
Please don't creep around this house.
I don't know what that means.
What?  How could he have?  When?
Ask him.
I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
What do you do?  What are you doing here?
It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
I could help you.  I could get you off that.
Where've you been?
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
So you can shoot a pistol?
So was my Patient.
You were in Africa?
Bonjour.
What do you want?
What?
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
Aren't you?
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
I'm fine.  I got hot.
Oh.
Why do you think?  About my staying?
Darling, for goodness' sake!
Oh really?
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -
Never heard of it.
Would you like me to?
You'd better be.
Hey! -
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
Arguing about books.
Kip's another one.
Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing?
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
I'll probably marry him.
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
This is Captain McGann.
Thank you.  Thank you.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
Excuse me -
He won't disturb us then.  I think he's after morphine.  There's a war.  Where you come from becomes important.  And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices.
He needn't disturb you.
He's Canadian.
There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
Because I'm a nurse.
Are you crazy?
Are you remembering more?
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
I'm turning you.
How?  How can you see anything?
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
Are you asleep?
When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure
Candaulesyou're laughing at me.
I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word.
Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!

I'm not sewing anything else for you!
No!
I'm not sewing anything else.
So one day we'll meet.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
Kip I -
Of course.  When?
Nya-nya-nya!
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
What are you up to?
You wouldn't come to find me?  That makes me never want to come here. But she continues unraveling the turban.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
You loved him.
Kip - come and dance with me
Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
Why would anyone do this?
I follow the wires.
So I follow the wires?
What do I do?
It's okay - I'll help.  Please.
I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
Yes, for your hair.
Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
I don't think so.
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
Oh God.  Oh God.
He's gone, hasn't he?
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
Why Picton?
He can't even move.
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
When he dies I'll catch up.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
What if you couldn't find him?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
Does he have to go?
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
He's sleeping.
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever you and Lieutenant Singh
Hello.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
I was looking forward to this evening.
You've got a mustache.
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
Darling, Peter says I could stay
How awful.  What will you do?
Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can muddle through.  Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife -  One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
I don't think so.
Coming.  I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
I'm going to get him, I promise you.
Too late now.
He's on to something bigger.
I'm in the middle.
I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
I don't know, but close.
We're getting close.
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
We've got to catch him in the act.
Yeah. Me.
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
Mac's signature.
Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.
Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Bingo.
Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
Through a window.
I don't recall asking your permission.
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
There are times when you don't answer the phone.
You gave them the eight billion.
He looks familiar.
--You're a cop.
My god--
What about you?
But--
What's wrong.
I'm not leaving without you.
No, you can't.
Hang on.
No way.
Jesus.
The door's the only way out!
We can't help it, we...we've gotta...
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...
We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
FUCKING THING!!!
Jesus God, it's going through.
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
The sign of our partnership.
I'm leaving from the Nathan Road Station at 6:30 tomorrow morning. You could come too.
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
Not for me.
That's because you grew up rich.
Four billion dollars.
So what are you going to do with your share?
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
But would you--would you--
It was wrong to deceive you.
You have something in mind?
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
No. You'll see when we get inside.
Surgically attached.
Parachute.
Pulse detectors.
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
How do I look?
Feeling old?
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
We're doing it tonight.
That's where the Mask comes in.
Got it.
The oscilloscope's already programmed.
Sit down, I'll show you how we're going to do it.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.
Peoples China Bank.
Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
The eight billion. From them to us.
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
My job, my rules.
Oh my god, I thought--
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?
The Mask. Where is it?
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
I told you. It's the down payment. And thanks to you it's overdue.
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
Everything.
I always knew you'd do the job.
Hold the record. Alone.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
Okay, 80-20--
I like banks.  That's where the money is.
You don't know the half of it.
Your share.
A billion dollars.
The big job.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
Yes. Yes.
No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
What?
We did it.
Shut up.
Duh.
They moved it.
Got it.
Ready.
You can't be too careful.
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
One, two, three...
It's a party.
In eye of that painting.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
And--
Something like that.
He wasn't.
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
Terrified. Still am.
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
To us. To the Mask.
Aren't we early?
I've got something for you.
Won't take any time.
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.
Thank you.
You bought this for me?
It's---beautiful.
That's it. We're ready.
Charged. Receiver?
Got it.
A dozen times.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
I didn't mean to get personal.
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
Hmmm.
Did I hear a car?
Let's do it again.
Why don't we take oxygen?
Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
Let's just see how we do.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
No. It's a down payment.
This isn't a good time to hear your personal philosophy.
I'll need that.
Someone was expecting that.
It was perfect.
You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
That's because I wanted them to!
No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt!
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
You don't get the Mask code unless I go.
We're doing this together. We're partners.
We go underwater?
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
In a week.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
Nice spot.
And good morning.
<u>I'm</u> dressed.
Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
What's my problem? You want a list?
I don't believe this.
That's entrapment.
Where's my bag?
You stole my luggage? You--
Those are my clothes.
What about your bags?
We're going to die, aren't we...
It's one way.
Motorcycle.
You what--?
What the hell was that?
What the hell do I do now?
Not funny.
He says they turned the card down.
A film case.
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
But--
It's a fake.
How much am I paying?
Fine. What do I do?
It's a test.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
You want me to pick up a painting?
Not a word.
Maybe I should drive this time.
We going somewhere?
It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.
You can't.
But Roki said--
I know.
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
Well, no...but...
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
I've got something for you.
No. Why would I be?
You...you can't.
So alive.
I didn't expect you to be so...
You're not taking me seriously.
I've got something...
Excuse me?
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
That's good. Terrific.
Are you...okay?
You disappeared.
I'll call an ambulance.
Uh, yes.
Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
I have a proposal for you.
I don't want to waste your time.
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
Mr. MacDougal.
How about if I try humility.
It's sold.
No you can't.
Uh. I'm showing off.
Who am I?
Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
That asshole smashed in my fucking neck!
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
What's your point?
Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
Which one?
Oh my God.  Oh my God.
Yup.
And get someone to help around the house.
Any school you want.
I can put them in a good school.
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
I don't even know how much money that is.
Five million dollars.
Five million dollars?
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
Oh, my God.
Both.
A number for the whole group, or for us?
The judge came up with a number.
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
It's a good day.  I feel good.
Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns now.  I was thinking -- Mandy really values your opinion ...
For what?
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.
Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea.  You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
Yeah.
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor.  But hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
What's chromium?
The chromium.  Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off.
The what?
Cause of the chromium.
Wow.  Why would they do that?
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
They did?
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.
Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
I'll say.  Holy moley.
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer --
Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.  They kinda surprised me --
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
Right.
Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.
Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
This is a real nice place you got here.
Hell, no.  I hate lawyers.  I just work for them.  You got a minute?
You're a lawyer?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
Yes?
Hi.  Donna Irving?
Two million dollars?
What is that?
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
I wasn't gonna --
Here what comes?
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
How do you know that?
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
Say you were wrong.
Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
You know what, Mr. Potter?  I completely forgot your birthday this year.  And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight.  So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you.
Morning!
No, I'm serious.  You know what Kurt Potter is?  He's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place. He's the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when PG&E offered 20 million.  He doesn't work like us, Ed.  There's no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing.
Fuck Kurt.
Why not?
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
When?  Where?
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
So why would PG&E offer it?
And if you had to guess ...
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
I know.  I'm sorry.  Do I get to hear what happened anyway?
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
Perks?  Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?
Bullshit.  You stuck me in Siberia dictating to some God damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me.  After all I've done for you, that's the thanks I get.
How dare you take that away from me.
<u>Not personal</u>?  That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is.
"Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
And, what, I'm not serious?
Kurt thought?  What about you?  Do you think anymore?
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
Not in my world.
Why the fuck should I respect her?
She insulted me!
Why good?
Counts?
What's a demur?
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
So what are you thinking?
Whoa.  No shit.
What kind of things come up?
You might want to think real hard about the amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.
I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.
Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
Yeah, I mind.  You bet your ass I mind.
I want my fucking money --
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.
Someone's following me.
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.
Yeah, I heard that one before.
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
You didn't care about my case?
Really?  It makes me sick.
Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u> the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things?  That's just not right.
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
What do you mean?
Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
No --
For your information, Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them.  That was his job.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
It didn't help, but no.  The real problem's on the bottom.
They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
<u>No</u>.
She lived on the plume.  You never know.
Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
Okay, fine.  I don't know shit about shit. But I know the difference --
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --
-- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it.
Bullshit.
Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
That's crazy -- why not?
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
And you can't?
I don't get why they'd do that.
At least they made an offer.
So you think we got 'em scared?
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
I want a raise.  And benefits.  Including dental.
Course I did.
Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay.
Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people.
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
Oh, yeah?
What are you doing here?
Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.
Don't bother.
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
I guess I'm not the right kind.
Excuse me?
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
Out to lunch with the girls.
Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --  I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit.  Sorry.  My kid --
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
There's two things I can't stand, Mr. Masry. Being ignored, and being lied to.  You did both.
You never called me back.  I left messages.
Yeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my kids.
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
Bullshit.  You told me I'd get half a million dollars.  You told me I'd be set.
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
What do you mean?
And you were told to destroy those?
And ...?
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
Did he say why?
The fuck you don't.  No one calls me Pattee. That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you.  People are dying, Ross.  You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it.  I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night.
Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
Not anymore.
Nope.  Maiden.
I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
I guess I did.
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
So that stuff -- it kills people.
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
There's more than one kind?
George!
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
That's not true; we had dinner together just last night.
Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
Hey, Ros, where are they?
PG& -- Are you sure?
What's going on in there?
So did I.
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
Oh, God, sweetheart, no.  There's nothing on Earth I love more than you.  Nothing.  I promise.
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
We'll see.
Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible.
That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Whose number do you need?
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research.
Hey -- those are my files --
I will.  Bye.
No, I need my car --
What time is it?
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
And I miss you.
I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're the only one I trust them with.
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
Thank you.
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
You already packed up your stuff?
I need it.
I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
I can't leave my job, George.
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
What's that?
About what?
What's going on?  What are you doing?
That is not what I'm --
What do you want to talk about instead? <u>Your</u> day?  That's a fascinating subject.
No, I wanna say hi.
That's Ed.
Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
Keep your voice down.
I didn't say that.
Nothing.
How would you know?
No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.
I'm not in danger.  I have a dead bolt. Remember?
I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.
I know what you're saying, and I don't wanna hear it.  I am doing the best I can.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
Doesn't matter.  Doesn't make one bit of difference.  Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so ... so <u>nothing</u>?
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
Great.
What are you doing here?
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
Thanks for reminding me.
What're you doing?
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
You're around every afternoon?
Right.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
Great.  Another deadbeat.
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
Cause I don't even know you.
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
Return 'em.  Maybe you'll get your money back.
No.
Yeah.  Sexy, huh?  And here's another: five. That's how old my other daughter is.  Seven is my son's age.  Two is how many times I been married and divorced.  You getting all this?  16 is the number of dollars in my bank account.  454-3943 is my phone number. And with all the other numbers I gave you, I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it.
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
Which number do you want, George?
You want my number?
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
That's okay.  I understand.
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
What?
Where's my paycheck?
I am not talking to you, bitch.
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
What's going on?
I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --
Someone stole my stuff.
I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are.  I thought maybe you'd know.
Uh-huh?
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
What?
It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.
Yeah.  Who are you?
Wow, that's soon --
You're moving away?  When?
What?
It'll be fine, yeah.
Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?
Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
Right, I guess those are the kids --
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
Who's Baxter?
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Dr. Paulsen?
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
... the power?
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
We should have stayed and finished them off.
What happened?
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
No thanks.
Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
You look silly.
What are you staring at?
I don't like this.
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
Can you trust him?
A mining colony.
Never heard of that system.
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
That depends.  Where are we?
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
You're going to attack them?!!!
No lightspeed?
The entrance is collapsing!
But the tremors have stopped.
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
Are you crazy!
Outside, in the cave.
There's something out there!
I do not!
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
Stop that.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
Yes, you do.
Would you please stop calling me that?
Where have I heard that before?
They're moving away.
Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
How do I look?
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
What is it?
Now you're making sense.
I'm against that.
Good.
I take it back.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Probably an asteroid field ....
Or you ran into something ....
I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem, or I'd be worried.
I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
I don't know what he's talking about.
I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
An Imperial probe droid.
What was it?
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
We are fighting for a cause much ...
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
And what are they, pray tell?
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
Yes.
Han, we need you here.
Does Luke know?
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
That sounds familiar.
Are the coordinates set?
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
Luke!
What'd you say?
We've got to find Luke.
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
We have no use for your kind.
And when do you betray us again?
What's going on?
... we're the bait.
What about Han?
It's a lovely outpost.
You're part of the mining guild then?
Thanks.
Not really.
You may call me Leia.
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
What is it?
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
I understand.
Let's go.
I thought you knew this person.
Well, what now?
What??
A tremor!
Closer?!
You don't have to do this to impress me.
I'll be back later.
You rest now.
This hyperdrive had better work.
Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
Luke, no!  It's a trap.
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
Where are you going?
What did you say?!
Me too.  I was afraid.
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
What honey?
Hiding?
Well why are they tearing the building down?
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
Sure you won't change your mind?
Me too.
I'm gonna miss you.
Storage.
Phonograph.
What is it?
Where do you want this?
Of course I didn't.
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
I can't believe it.
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
We have to start looking for a shrink.
What did the doctor say?
Yeah, well I guess you should've.
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
What's Burke got to do with it?
Burke.
Didn't who tell me?
What didn't he tell you?
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
Why don't you let me?
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
Maybe the circuit is busy?
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
No kidding.
Just five or six people.
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
Dinner at the White House.
What's this?
And you got an invitation.
Oh great, anything else?
Here.
Oh not to bad, kinda like the Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story, but other than that it was terrific.
Hi, how'd your day go?
Hi
In here!
Hello?
You're a nice man.
Really? wow.
What's her name?
Of course. Have you got a pen?
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
Would you like some more coffee?
Want to ask him?
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Not that I know of.
No. Not at all,
We still don't know.
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
No, she was heavily sedated.
No thanks Karl.
What man?
What!
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
Karl!!
No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Well don't go now Karl the stores aren't open yet.
Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
I just heard them Karl.
All right then we've got clean rats.
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
Is it coming out Willie?
That's good.
How are you today?
Morning.
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Oh. What are you talking about for Christ sake! Did you see her or not? She's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or...
What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
So, what causes this?
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
Convulsion?
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
She used those words?
Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor.
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
You're kidding! Like what?
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
Never.
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
And those lies she's been telling?
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Depression?
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
What is it? A tranquilizer?
Why the math?
Is she gonna die?
Yes. He's already here.
She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out of the window.
She...killed Burke Dennings.
What's the difference?
No
In Europe.
Are you sure?
What do you drink?
Wanna drink.
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
No.
You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
What else?
Like what?
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
Oh, will you help her! Just help her!
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
Could you see her?
You could do it yourself...
But how?
Why, I don't understand?
Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist.
Oh yeah, since when?
I didn't get you?
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
You wouldn't.
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
On what?
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
He didn't mention?
About my daughter?
Did he tell you about my party?
Pretty close?
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Where?
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
Yeah, it would've helped. Have you gotta cigarette Father?
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
Please go away.
Hi Father.
Honey this is Father Dyer.
All done.
Make it stop,it really hurts! Mother! Make it...
So something please Doctor, Help her!
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!
Honey it's to help you.
I don't want it.
Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
Oh my God!
Oh, honey.
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
What are you doing here?
God gets lonesome for us, Rags. He wants us back.
Why does God let us get tired?
People get tired.
Okay.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
How do you know?
Well your thinking's not so good.
I don't know, I just thought.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
Well I heard differently.
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
Do you not like him like daddy?
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
But you like him.
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
What?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Your not gonna marry him are you?
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
You like him.
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Well you know it's okay.
Mr. Dennings?
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Oh I love you.
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
Yeah
Well what would you like to do? Got any ideas?
I don't know
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
Oh you wouldn't talk, well I didn't have my make up man there.
I wouldn't talk.
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
Cause I like it.
Regan, why are you reading that?
You think?
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.
Here I'll show you.
Oh I bet he is.
He's nice.
Oh, Captain Howdy....
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
Who's Captain Howdy?
Captain Howdy.
Captain who?
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
You really don't want me to play huh?
Oh yeah, well let's both play.
No you don't. I do it all the time.
Wait a minute you need two.
Here I'll show you.
You know how?
Yeah.
You've been playing with it?
The closet
Where?
I found it.
Hey, where'd this come from?
Oh it's so funny.
You like it?
Oh look at that.
We'll see Regan.  Now about those party invitations.......
When can I have one?
We'll see when we get home okay.
Oh............
Well, not while we're in Washington.
Your kidding?
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
What kind of stuff?
Um........Stuff.
What did you do today?
Goodbye Father. I call you.
She doesn't remeber a thing.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
Karras.
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
Oh, Christ.
So what's next?
So what's wrong with her?
Yes.
I'm afraid.
No.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Sometimes.
Twelve.
Yes.
And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore!
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
I can't sing it anymore.
Huh?
Forget it.
Some discussion.
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
Uh ...
Huh?
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
What's with you guys?
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Huh?
What's with you two?
Oh yeah?
I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank.
They must've bought the same map we did.
Wow. You ever see her again?
What'd she sing?
Peggy Lee?
You're kidding me.
Great?
Hey, we're connected.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Smells like fish.
I don't believe it.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
He's right.
Virgins?
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
You play all these places?
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
Maybe it's legit.
Hey.
We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.
The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
I was gonna split it with you guys.
Hey!
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
I said I was sorry.
Switch?  What fucking switch?
Piece of cake.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
You're a prince.
Oh, thanks.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
They're tight.
Shoes?
Zip me up?
What do you think?
Nine!
Nine.
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
Save it for your wife.
I wear a seven.
A seven.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
Time for what?
Hey!
Am I missing something?
What's wrong with it?
Do I look like I'm naked?
What's he talking about?
Changed?
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
Where's my name?
So work with me, not against me. Okay?
What I mean is --
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
Don't leave a girl hanging. Second rule of show business.
When?
So?
I sing now?
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
Funny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over. Like a song.
Yeah.
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
Let me get the light.
Well, this is some surprise.  Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.
Jack.
Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
Huh?
Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
So ... ?
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
You can always get another girl.
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!
Yeah... No.
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Frank said ---
Oh.
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
So, what happened?
You're kidding.
Nervous?
You sending me home?
Oh. So what's it doing here?
The both of them?  In there?
No kidding?
Huh?
Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At least he was clean.  Boy, the guys I met when I was with the service, you wouldn't believe.  The older ones, they were okay.  Nice.  Polite.  Pulled the chair out for you.  But the younger ones ...  Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again.  She thought she had it all figured out. But she wasn't so smart.  There are killers with palms like a baby.
Soap convention.
You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
Sure.
Ed? How many people live here?
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
Who's Nina?
Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit!
You were good.
You were good.
What's that supposed to mean?
All I said was you were good.
You're upset.
What'd I say?
What's the matter?
Better than that.
How do you do it? Every night?
Guess I got a little scattered.
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
In and out.
How's egghead?
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
Can't sleep?
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
So why's he do it?
Aren't the kids asleep?
He do that every year?
Nothing personal --
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
Paris Opals.  Twelve-and-a-half cents.  I sat down with a pencil and added it one day.  But I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best.  Ah, here's a lost soul.
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit.
I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere.
Where's egghead?
Oh.  Well, for Blackie then.
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
Not for money. With my mother.
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman.
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
Merry Christmas, Jack.
Can I stay here tonight?  Even if she comes here?
Jack.
From Hurley's?
Not so good.
How'd the show go?
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
What's a prom?
Why not?
Wow.
Looks old.
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
I guess it's getting serious.
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
What are they?
Is that what you used to do?
Married.
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
Guess they're up.
Did you break a cup, Jack?
Damn right.
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
Jon, what is it?
-- Or maybe all at once.  There's a get-together tonight at New St. Marks. For all the bureau chiefs and their families.  He's insisted Jamie and I be there too.
What do you mean?
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
Tell me what happened on April 9th -- 13 years ago.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
I took it from my fake husband.
How did he expect to do that?
I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
Whoever you are, don't call again.
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
Who is this?
Is someone there?
You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  GO!
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
And you wouldn't be.
I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help.
No.
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
... I was dreaming ...
So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...
I'm late for surgery.
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
Wait a second -- you hated Madonna.  Didn't you?
Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
I'm going to the powder room.
Good.  Because I'm fed up.
That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
-- Yes.
Nothing.
-- Studying.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
You're wearing your suit --
... That's great.
-- what?
You always say that -- then you leave.
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
You wouldn't even sip champagne at our wedding. We were underage -- you wouldn't break the law.  Remember what my brother called you?
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
-- I've got to study.
No.
What is with you tonight?
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
The hospital.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
What happened to your big "assignment"?
Im not worried, Mom. Hes still learning our ways...
Fightings a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
Thats right.  Okay, lets make a quick stop at the kids shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then Ill run into the linen store...
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
Were almost done here...
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
Mom, dont you think we need to open the presents?
Youre jumping, sweetheart...
Rise...and...shine...!
Is it morning yet?
Ringing my bell...
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Thats good but...you did forget the anniversary.
Mom liked it.
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
Thats where you work.
Big Eds.
Bye...
Try not to be late because kids dont like to be the last one picked up.
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
This is day care.  Its where babies go when their parents are at work.
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Do you like kids?
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
They did a pretty good job.
Wheres my real dad?
Dont do this, Jack... But he continues...
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
Jack.
Jesus, Jack...
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Not with what they pay me...
Thats the one...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and Im going to be heading it up.
Im moving to Paris...it was right here...  Its a box marked Jack.  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
Dont worry about it, Jack...
Its good to see you...
Jack...God, its been so long...You look...
I promise. Come to bed, honey.
I promise, Jack...
Are you okay, Jack?
Youve been Jack Campbell.  And thats always a good thing...
Its been interesting, thats for sure.
Dont do that...
Then get a goddamn snow blower!
Jack.
I cant believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
Annie goes to a great school.
Are you out of your mind?
What are you talking about, Jack?
A perk for what?
For the week?
So whats the big surprise? You didnt rent this place for the weekend, did you?
Its like a museum.
I could stay here forever...
Thats all I wanted to hear...
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
Way out...
I dont know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off.
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
What are you sure about?
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and youve seen my pay check.
Cmon, Jack, you think there arent mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell Im doing in New Jersey...
I think its good to be a little unsure about who you are.  Its very human.
And now...?
Worse, you mean...
Now Im worried...just say it.  Whatever it is well deal with it.
Okay...
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
How do you even know about this place?
Jack...can we afford all this?
You actually forgot our anniversary.
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until its light out.
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
I found it at an outlet store.  I know its a knock-off, but I think itll look great on you...
No, open it...
Jack.
Nice, Jack.  Youre sweeping me off my feet.
Then say it...just say it to me...!
Cmon, you know what I like to hear...
Say it, Jack...
Its good, right?
You want the cake!?
Sorry, Jack.  Its too important to me.
You mean this chocolate cake?
How was the game, honey?
If you want to look at it that way...
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store.
The trek out to the hospital every day didnt help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
You cant really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village...
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her.
I think it worked out okay, dont you?
Well...Annie for one.
Maybe youre not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldnt need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if thats what its gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids college fund.
Its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
Really.
Excuse me?
No?
Those shoes were twenty five dollars.  Cmon, take it off.  Well go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like.
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
Look at me like you havent seen me every day for the last twelve years...
How can you do that?
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Thanks, Jack...
Its ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We dont have time for wining and dining.
That is the general idea, yes...
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
And...?
...my feet are hurtin...
Youre having a bad day, Ill go with you...actually, theres no way in hell youre gettin me back out there...
Fine, shes the kids dog.  Lets go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
Shes your dog, Jack.
Here you go...
Jack...
Uh huh...
Funny, Jack.  Im laughing on the inside.
Because youll be here.
Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.
You look forward to this party all year.  Whats with you today?
Look, we dont have time for this right now, well talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  Youre not wearing that to the Thompsons party. I dont care how hilarious you think it is...
Jack...dont even start...
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Where were you?
What kind of man does that!?
Are you okay?
I can't seem to let go of you...
We're being responsible.  Go. Get on the plane.
Go. Im sorry, you should just go...
Right, for us. But...Im afraid that if you get on that plane...
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
Dont  go, Jack...
I know weve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.
I have a bad feeling about this.
I also put side two of London Calling on there...
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
I found it!
Yes!
You didnt seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
<u>Where is Reed</u>?
No, it's not.  I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
<u>What</u> did he do to the uniform?!
He didn't.
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
Victor did.
I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
But Johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.
What are you doing --
No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
As soon as you stop <u>acting</u> like one. Come on, you're <u>smarter</u> than this. You think those people out there <u>care</u> about you?  You're just a <u>fad</u> to them.
Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
You two need a time-out.
You gave us <u>names</u>?  What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
I'm driving.
<u>Girl</u>...?!
That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
I think that thing is Ben.
Stop it.
Johnny.
Apparently I can disappear.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
That would have kinda defeated the purpose.  And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
I gave him twenty.
Of course I was.  I'd read all your papers on bioethics.  Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
Better than your <u>life</u>.  Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  <u>We</u> are.
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?
And reverse the mutations --
What are you doing?
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
Are you kidding?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
Excuse me?
What about you?  You haven't eaten in days.  How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
If it happened to him, then it could...
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
What?
It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
What?  What do you mean you --
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
Which was?
You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
Yes, thanks.
Great minds think alike.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
It's been changed.
Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
I was talking about us.  Working together.
Never better.
Victor, we <u>can't do anything</u> until the research is ready.
Please don't make this personal --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
You said it was urgent.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Victor, your scar --
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Victor, are you feeling alright?
You can't leave them out there.
What are you doing?
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
It's just business.
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
We must!
But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
Listen...the Heart.
He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.
Air bubbles!... Doctor --
Doctor...you can't mean that! Not when we've come this far. And if we give up, there'll be no way of saving Mr. Benes --
But big enough for us...
They're much smaller than bacteria...
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
I -- I want to say...
Doctor...
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
What do you mean?
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
A great deal more than that, I believe...
Thank you for saving my life.
I feel much better now...
Open it! Open it before they get here!
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
No, it requires such absolute precision --
Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
You can't --it's too dangerous --
Shouldn't you answer that?
I have no idea.
But I did. I'm positive!
Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?
And if it should take more time to get through --
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
You may learn to like it.
I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
We're pushing oxygen today.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Where'd you get him that parka?
Oh, he's adorable.
Oh, now he's adorable.
You have children?
Oh, yah, I know that!
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
End a April.
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh... A what?
Mm.
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
Oh, yah?
And what about the other fella?
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Can you be any more specific?
In what way?
Where you girls from?
Yah, that can happen.
Uh-huh.
Yah?
Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
I'm sorry, sir, I -
Sir? Right now?
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
... I'm sorry, sir?
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
Yah, but -
but do you know that for sure without -
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch. I'll let you get back to your paperwork, then.
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
...Mr. Lundegaard?
Uh-huh. Well, I'm a police officer from up Brainerd investigating some malfeasance and I was just wondering if you've had any new vehicles stolen off the lot in the past couple of weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass Ciera?
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Huh? Do you mind if I sit down - I'm carrying quite a load here.
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
Mr. Lundegaard?
Oh, yah?
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
How we doin' on that vehicle?
Yah.
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
Uh-huh.
You look in his citation book?
No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
Somebody shut his lights. I guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back.
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
There's two of 'em, Lou!
Let's go take a look at that trooper.
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
...Well, that passed.
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
Where is everybody?
Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?
Hiya, Lou.
Aw, Norm.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Yah.
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
It's okay, Mike...
It's okay...
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
Better times.
I'm sorry, Mike.
No, I didn't...
I'm sorry.
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
Well, they're a good outfit.
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
No, no, that's fine.
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids?
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
You're livin' in Edina, then?
...This is a nice place.
Just a Diet Coke.
Yah - easy there - you do too!  I'm expecting, ya know.
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
Yah - how are you doon?
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Yah, that's me.
Yah.
No, that's okay.
Yah, yah, course I remember.  How are ya? What time is it?
So you think you might remember who those folks were who called ya?
...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that.
Now, I saw some rough stuff on your priors, but nothing in the nature of a homicide...
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
...Now, I know you've had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole -
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
Anyone else residing there?
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
There's the car! There's the car!
Copy.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Sorry - didn't copy.
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
Gustafson's accountant.
And this guy is...
The day of our homicides.
Geez. Well - geez. That's a suprise.
Oh. Geez.
Oh. Oh, my.
So... they didn't...
Linda Cooksey?
Linda.
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
Norm?
...Mike Yanagita!
...Well, yah. Who's this?
Yah?
Hello?
I love you, Norm.
That's terrific.
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
It's terrific!
Norm, that's terrific!
Your mallard?
...So?
They announced it?
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
No, no.
Oh, fine.
Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
...How's the paintin' goin'?
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Yah.
Prowler needs a jump.
Hon?
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.
Yah. Well, I just can't thank you enough, Detective Sibert, this cooperation has been outstanding.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
Oh, my.
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
And his wife?
Uh-huh.
Who did this to you?
My God, you're shot...
What happened... ?
I'm not paying this back.  I consider it "asshole tax."
Why are you doing this?
Tyler...
Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to see you again!
Let go of me!
What?!  You're sorry?  I don't believe that for a minute.
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...
No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...
You are an insane person.
What?
Whatever.  I'll take my food to go...
What?
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
You got about thirty seconds.
Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie.
I've done you enough favors.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
What... ?
What is wrong with you?
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
Is that what you're calling it?
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
Is this a trick?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Yeah?
What?
Can I come in?
You're afraid to say.
Why would you get bent if I asked?
Guy or girl?
What is this?  Who did this?
That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?
Hear what?
What do you get out of it?
It was the smart move on her part.
Do you care?
Chloe's dead.
Whatever.
Well... thanks, anyway.
I could check your prostate.
I wish I could return the favor.
Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.
You feel nothing?
Make sure.
Feel anything?
Here.
Here.
Good.
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
Please.
Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
What... ?
Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
Like testicular cancer?
Really?
You haven't been going to yours.
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
Where have you been the last few weeks?
I suppose.
Should we?
Looks like this is goodbye.
Deal.
That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh?
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
So far, you have four and I only have two!
I want that.
I want brain parasites.
I'll take the parasites.
I don't know -- am I?
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
Really?
-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
Go ahead.  I'll expose you.
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
And I saw you practicing this...
What?
Sure.
I have to save Eugene!
No!  It can't be.
I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
What did you see?
Yeah, fuck 'em.  No offense.
Speed up.
What do you want me to do?
Yes.  I was in a hospital.  There was screaming... A nurse was choking me.  I couldn't tell what she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face.  Kalarjian.
Another premonition?
No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
What did you see?  What am I looking for?
I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
Six duds in a row.
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
How you doing in there, hero?
What about that?
So let's do it.
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
Please, what else could it mean?
Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
You were there?
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
I...I...
You have to tell us now.
I hope you're ready for this.
The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.
How can you say that?  What kind of monster are you?
I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it.  Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others.  That's the worst killer of them all.
That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
Signs?
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
That still doesn't make sense.  You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to.  But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition, not first.
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
What list?
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too?
Nice work.  Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me.  But I doubt you'll survive that long.
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
Yeah, how?
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
She had the baby?
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
We need to hurry.
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
Holy shit.  He said "only new life can defeat death."  If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design...
He probably already knows we're coming.
A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.
Random, sure.
What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?
Carter.
What about the rest of you?  Kimberly, you were driving to Daytona.  Was Route 18 your first choice?
The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
You can't cheat destiny.  I know what I have to do to save us.  I have to die.
I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile- up.
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
I know how it feels to be dead.
Shouldn't we pull over?
I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!
How do you know?
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
It throws the entire Death list out of whack.  And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch.  We all start over with a clean slate.
Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.
This is cheery.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
They're next on the list.  We have to find them.
Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
Clean up?  I don't...
Then you believe all this??  That Death is working off a list?
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
...My Premonition was just like his.
Billboards about accidents.  Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like...
The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
You're not listening to me!  You have to do something!
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
I can live with thaaaa --
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
No, I'm good.
I guess so.
I...I don't know.
Sure.
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
More than that.  All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together.  She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on.  His car was leaking oil all over the road.
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
That it's not over yet.
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
You got it, Dad.  I'll call you if I have a problem.
Hey, Dad.  What's up?
I know, Dad.
I know this is the first time we've been apart since.  But everything's gonna be okay.
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
No! No! Don't!
Police are coming.
Get out! Get out of the car!
Carter, get out!
Can't you open the door?!
Stop the car!
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.
Nothing is... anymore.
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
Most kids never have it happen.
Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence.
I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day... that's a reach.
4:25.
Like... 4:25.
No.
Thirty-nine.
As in flannels and plaids?
Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
Then, let's go see him!
Is that something you're "feeling?"
"It?"
That's why I was there last night.
Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
He's not a witch.
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
Get control of yourself!
Not with us in the fuckin' car!
Knock it off!
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
What are you doing?
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
What was that?
Why you don't feel love?  Not allowed?  Dead inside, maybe?  You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!
Yes you can.
I know.  I go with you.
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass kicked without me.
You think you are... .
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
Nguyen is good boy.
Huntington Beach, California.
Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.
Oh.  They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.
Spooks?
Crazy motherfucker.
Where did you find this clown?
I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
It means "virgin."  My mother was comedian.
Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
No really..I can't.
The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
Oh, no..I have to get home...
Yeah!
Really?
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
I'm paying you.
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts...
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
I never really...went through a... dating period.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
Meeting ... people.
What?
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
Fine.
Well, there's nobody special!
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
Do I look like I have someone special?
...SO...anybody special in your life?
It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say,  "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".
My parents were divorced.
You threw him out?
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
Will it hurt?
No, thank you.
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
I've never been in an apartment above a store.  You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
Well did you or didn't you?
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
Yeah.
But now it's free, right?
This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
<u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
Most men are.
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
Jack, he's starting a conversation...
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
Terrific. Going on alot of dates ... seeing lots of men... lots of dates..
Well!  What do you want me to do - applaud?
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?
No.  So what time do you need?  I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!  I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that!  So what do you need to figure out alone!?
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
... What?... You don't want to commute?
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
Ya know, I'm thinkin' -- with another income coming in, I would love to get a bigger place.
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
<u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
<u>Whoah</u>!  Oh, honey, that's terrific!
You're kidding!  What did he say?
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
What are you two up to?
Thank you very much.
I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
Hello....congratulations.
Well, what the hell does that mean?
What does that mean?
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
And who's Lydia?
The moron?
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
Can I have my desk please.
You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
Oh sure... Gotta believe in God.  But I don't think God made man in his own image.  No.  'Cause most of... the bullshit that happens, is because of men.  No, I think man was made out of the devil's image and women were created out of God -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women are attracted to men, because, lets face it, the devil is a helluva lot more interesting -- I slept with a few saints and let me tell you... <u>Booooorring</u>!!!... And so the whole point of life, I think, is for men and women to get married so the devil and God can live together and, ya know -- work it out...  ... Not that we have to get married.
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
Okay.  ... I love you...
Please... before you go on... let me tawk... okay... We've had a wonderful time together... When we first met, you said this wasn't serious and I shouldn't get serious and then you moved in and we haven't been serious. And I just wanna say that I have no regrets.  None.  And don't wanna have any now so I want ya to be up front with me... I want the truth. If you're seein' somebody else, let me know... You don't have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me.  Just tell me the truth.
... So... where did you sleep last night?
You're all right... you sure...
You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police...
<u>Oh my God</u>... <u>What did they do</u>!  <u>My</u> <u>God</u>!!!
<u>What</u>!
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
How much?
Free?
Now what?
So how do we do this?
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Which ones?
Huh-huh.
Yes.
Yeah?  Who is this?
Shhh...
You have a disease.
Divorced.
You're married.
Oh... You mean you don't want to.
Listen, you're very nice... b...
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
You don't have to say that.
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
There isn't any more to tell.
What do you do - for a living I mean?
How do you know him?
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
What a gyp.
Got any Ethel Merman?
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
I don't like horror movies!
Oh...like Moses.
Parry Parry?
Sure you don't want anything?
You got any change?
I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
Bobby...
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
What?
This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop.  How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
Okay...
It brings out my eyes...
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
Bobby, don't talk like that...
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
Well, is that a happy face I see?
You're depressed that I come along.
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!
I'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.
"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."
"You'll be burned out/Or smoked out/An' come back to me, I know..."
You like it?
You'll be gone, period.
Do you love me, Bobby?
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
You treat me like I was.
I'm not some piece a crap.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
I hope they do.
Yes.
I'm not.
That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it...
I did, didn' I, El?
I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...
Is it my turn again?
I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
I'll go out with you, or I'll stay here, and do anything you'd like for me to do... if you'll just do one thing. If you'll tell me that you love me.
Out where?
No, dammit, I would easy.
Serveza yourself!
Sugar, you know how I feel about you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things, an' what I'm tryin' to do with myself...  You know, there id'n anything in the world I wouldn't do for you, baby. I started livin' the day I found you, you know that?
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
Well, lemme sing the one I picked an' see what you think...  "When there's a fire in your heart/Break the glass/Sound the alarm..."
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
Well, lemme play the other side then.
Bye, Robert.
But what about me?
You were going without saying goodbye?
You're leaving?
Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
I don't know where she is!
It's none of your business!
My turn.
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
You know, he was formerly a sailor.
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
Why are you being so mean?
With applesauce?
Do you want some gingerbread?
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
Like what?
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
A week or two isn't going to ruin your life, for Godsakes.
It's not that bad.
He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
A couple of months.
I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
All right...
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Wait...
I know.
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either...
He's had two strokes.
Daddy's very ill.
Robert, I have to tell you something...
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
Well, 11 months ago he was on his bicycle, on his way to the post office in La Roche... and he ran into a Jeep and sprained his neck...
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
I have to talk seriously with you...
Robert...
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
You know who it once belonged to?
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
Thank you...  Oh no, don't put it on there...
You always do this to me.
I just can't look at you.
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
Robert Eroica...
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
Tea.
I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.
Yes.
I'm trying to be delicate with you, but you're not understanding me. It's not just because of Carl, or my music, but because of you...  I mean, what would it come to? If a person has no love for himself, no respect, no love for his work, his family, his friends, something... How can he ask for love in return? I mean, why should he ask for it?
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
Please, I'll see you later this evening.
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
What?! I can't hear you!
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
No, I can't...
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
I'll be back later...
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
Robert?
Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
Yes.
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl...  How are you?
Something witty and devastating like that.
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
I don't believe vou.
No inner feeling.
No, don't do that...
Yes, that's what's important to me...
I'd like you to leave now. Is that direct enough?
I don't find your language that charming.
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you... Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.
I don't think that's accurate...
Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
I think it's what you think.
No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
At being a fake.
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
Then I must have been supplying it.
You had no inner feeling?
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
Why?
Is that funny?
I was really very moved by the way you...
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
You don't call that music, though.
I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
If you're free.
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
Tomorrow's a full practice day...  But the day after is kind of open.
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
Why?
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Swimming?
Yes, intentionally.
Hello...
And you no longer play at all?
What have you been doing since then?
Oh, uh huh. I had a little kittycat once, that Bobby give me...
What kind of doggy is that?
I do eat slow as a bird, whereas Bobby can put it away like a speed swing...  Is there any ketchup around?
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
I hope I didn't hear that.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
Besides being very rude.
I don't think that's true.
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...
No, I wouldn't.
And what about love?
You better hold onto your tongue!
Don't call me "mack," honey.
Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.
That's an old maid's tale.
Well...
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
Jesus, what a rude person...
Well, she was.
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
There's some good things on it, though.
Oh, for pity's sake...
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
Yes.
Oh, 'cause you got it like dat?
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.
How you treat them?
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
So what you think of me?
That's it?
So wadda you do with your girls?
Me? No. Don't want none either. Such bastards, man.
A play-ya.
So what's her name?
So you got a girl?
Whadja wanna see me about?
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
You know somebody around here?
What are you doin' here?
So watcha doin'?
Um. Yeah! Shorty!
Hi.
Wussup?
What?
Do you have a name?
Who are you?
I guess not.
That's it.
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
Is there anything particular you're looking for?
Here you are, Doctor.
Yes, right away.
Oh my God!
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
Can I get you something?
You're in the Records Room.
Are you all right, Doctor?
Nothing. They're still there.
Will you kill me?
What do you say, Mr. Nugent? You'll be doing me and my family a great service.
That's right.
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
Do you have a passport?
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
In this drawer....
I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
I want you to murder me.
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.
Come inside.
Who?
Alan Stanwyk.
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
Because we can't.
We can't talk about it here.
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
I want to hear this.
Don't worry, I can take it.
I'm terrified.
Don't tell me I can't --
I'm calling the police. Right now.
Bastard.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
What is this....
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
I was afraid you'd say that.
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
What are you talking about?
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
But I've seen the deed.
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
What does all this mean?
How do you know about that?
What are you talking about?
So?
Who.
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
Why did you do it?
I think you should call me Gail, now.
What is this?
He never sees them and I never met them.
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
Depends on the question.
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
It's amazing.
You were in the war?
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
God...
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
I mean put clothes on.
I really should change.
Down boy.
You ordered it here?
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
Hi.
John Ultramalensky?
Who is it?
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
See what I mean?
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
Alan's in Utah.
I bet you do.
Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
I love the outfits.
Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
Damn, I thought I had that one.
Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
That's a strange combination.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
John who?
John! You used to fly together!
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
In a minute!
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
You don't know the Underhills?
John!
Yes?
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
That was close...
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
Drink your cappucino, you're giving me a headache...
Did she tell you anything?
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
I'll do my best.
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
So you...
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
Uh, let's go sit down.
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
Who?
I have no answers.  Thanks for the stain.  Find the girl.  In the envelope are tickets to the Dorothy Chandler.  We'll chat again, then.
Actually, you may take it all now.
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
Excuse me?
But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Who's your decorator?
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
Please.
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Wha --
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s
But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Johnny's C.D.?
Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
You're not funny.
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
I came to warn you...
Hello, Ford...
Ah, an obvious choice.
Who?
You okay?
Hello...  It's Colleen.  With answers.  She wants to meet.  Down.  Way down-town.  Late.
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
Contacts.
Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
Make eye contact when you say that.
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
Spooky.  I'll process her.
I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
So what about this watch?
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
Quit crying.  I think we've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here...
You're saying you need money.
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
You wish.
Exactly.
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
There's that question...
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
Ick.
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Suck a dick, I left my purse...
This way...
Nice left you got there, jerk.
But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
Ford, you were right!
This is boring, guys.
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Who cares about people?
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
What a perv...
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
You didn't ask.  Have you ever thought about mousse?
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.
Because I know rock-n-roll.
Spunk, come back...
It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
Why are all these people after me?
Peachy.
Hello?
It's red, Ford.
Fluck you!
I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
Frank...
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
The future guy?
So am I.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
I know.  He loves that thing.
Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
Okay...
Do you know how much I love you?
I'm off.
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
I love you more.
Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...
You give him his drops?
Where's Johnny?
Frank...what's wrong?
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.
He did.
Butch called.
How was your tour?
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
I think I ruined the sauce...again.
Damn.
Well, why not a little of the King?
Hey, bud.
I'm sorry.  I didn't realize...  But she knew, John.  A mother knows what's in her son's heart.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Are you a good cop, John?
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
You work too hard, John.
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
Close.
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.
Sure.
What?
Barely.
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
I vote for the hammock.
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
Think you can figure it out?
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
Not now.  I'm cold.
What're you doing?
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
Why don't we go take a swim?
What was that?
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
Cool it, Andy.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
Have you ever made love in a hammock?
A hammock?
Your bed.
What's this?
You go ahead...
Come on down!
I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.
What are they saying?
Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
Which one is it?
Sort of.
Could we move a little faster?
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
You promised you'd never ask me.
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.
It's deceiving.
Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.
No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
Are you all right, Shelly?
I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
Somebody was in here.
Did you stay here last night?
Nothing.
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
I don't know.
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
Derek... stop.
You're wrong.
I never said you were "nothing".
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
You don't "have to."
Why do you do these stupid things?!
Damn you, Shelly!
Don't say any more.
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
Bullseye!
You're the boss.
What're you doing?
This is no time to celebrate!
Got any good ideas?
Keep looking.
Stop worrying.  I don't think they'll bother to come after us.
See anything?
Yes.
May be please have the wallet.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Why don't you help us?
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
In that little thing?
What d'ya got in there?
You're Shelly?
I don't care about being hip anymore.
But she might be in trouble...
Have you seen Tamara?
Jason...Voorhees?
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
But...wait a minute!
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
Time to check out the waiters.
Yeah.
That was truly excellent.
Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
What are you going to do?
Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice.
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night. You've got your whole life to be uptight.
I guess not.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
No thanks.
You're joking, right?
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit.  He might even pay some attention to me.
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
Improvise, of course.
What are you going to do?
A major prick.
More or less. It's part of my college fund.
He bought you that?
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.
Really?
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
I packed it. Just for us.
They're out of town.
Nothing.
Perfectly.
I don't think that's such a safe idea
There must be a phone around here somewhere.
Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
What are you talking about?
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
Did you find Rennie?
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
What are you doing??
Oh dear God...
Where is she?
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
No, I think it's just the beginning.
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York.
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
You pushed me...
I...I can't...
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
Can't we at least talk about it?
But Sean said...
I'm staying.
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
She didn't push me into coming.
I'm staying.
Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason Voorhees.
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
Did you have an accident in the lake?
After your parents passed away?
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
When did this start?
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
It's not that simple.
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
I gathered that.
I can't swim.
There's something I haven't told you...
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
Yeah...a lot.
So, are you having fun yet?
No, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The ship's only so big and there's certainly no way off it, is there?
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
Rennie, you're the best student I ever had...you have a real gift. If anybody can make use of that pen, it's you.
I don't know what to say...
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
Really?
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
Just felt a little chill.
Everything okay?
What about not-so-great writers?
You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
I'm glad you decided to come after all.
Please, hurry...
Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
I'm not!!
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
Is the ship going to sink??
The window...
Just radio for help, okay???
Where are they?
What do you mean???
What about you?
Can he really take us home?
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
I'd love to.
But I didn't get you one...
We changed our minds.
Hi, Sean.
Alla puttanesca.
Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
Elliot?
Guys ready to order?
He will absolutely hate it.
It's your best play, Nicky.
It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
Because we're completely mismatched.
We're able to surprise each other.
I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
It can't be all that personal.
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
What?
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
She died.
What about her?
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
Daddy, wait.
Will I believe you when you tell me something?
What will we talk about?
Except I won't have a father anymore.
I'm not sure.
I have a class. I'm late.
I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
She is kicking you out.
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
Is it?
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
I go to college. I thought you knew.
See, Daddy.
What else?
See, Daddy.
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
Yes.
You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
What do we want?
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
Yes.
A flat-out hit.
Packs an emotional wallop.
Brilliantly moving.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
I'm willing to tell you my name.
Why won't you tell me your name?
I'm glad we're having this talk.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
It violates so many trusts.
She's my gynecologist.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
Joanne Bourne.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
That's very lovely actually.
I'd forgotten that.
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
That's always been my problem.
Who the hell cares?
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
Your father said you might be here.
This could be it!
Don't worry. It's a test.
Because faith is rewarded.
Washed away.
Because God loves a winner.
Matthew.
Speak it like it's real. Matthew.
Then say it.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down.
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work.
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
It's a simple subject.
And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
You're a family man, Frankie?
Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
You're charming the boy.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
That's a simple subject.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
Matthew's my grandson.
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Matthew, look at him. When I lived in Roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere. He was bigger than ten movie stars.  Where's your white Lincoln limo?
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
He goes to the theater armed.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
Never mind.
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
No one's waiting.
Home.
He's a very sweet man.
Do you think he can do it?
Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
Is what true?
The fact is, I have to get going.
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
I hear good things about the new play.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
Alla puttanesca.
What?
A little drastic maybe?
Engaging.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
A little.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
I think I remember.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
I'm going home to my machine.
I don't want you, Steven.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
I haven't come to you.
What's wrong with him?
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
It's about the Director.
Good to see you're feeling better.
Jerome--?
Not so long--just once around the sun.
--when you go away.
What is it?
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
What happened?
My medication.  I left it back there.
I can't.
Who are they?
What about the car?
Why are we leaving?
What <i>is</i> this place?
So you didn't do it after all.
Of course I think about it every day.
Nothing yet.  I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties.  But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67.
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
I don't think so.  The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun--  --on this satellite right here.
I envy you, Jerome.
You're angry--
You didn't know?
You celebrate, Jerome?
Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
In the South Wing.
They found an eyelash.
Friend?
I know about you.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
Why would we do that?
No.
Yes.
I was at home.
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
What now?
I guess we are.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
Are we going to make it?
How long before this car's hot?
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
Where do we go from here?
Who was it?
You're crazy.
So what?
What is it?
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
What's wrong?
I'll be ready.
Oh, Jesus... how?
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
That's all I want... It's the only thing I have ever wanted.
Can we make it?
Okay.
Things can't get much worse can they?
Sounds good.
No more about Beynon.
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
I don't want to hear it.
Sure...
Yeah.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
No scars?
I think so... I don't know.
Not now.
Twenty eight hundred.
El Paso.
Only one car.
You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
I did I killed a man.
That would be the first time.
Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
You're full of ifs.
What?
Why, there's nothing on the news?
Like what?
You've got it all figured.
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
Do you mean that?
What do you want to do?
When we had trouble before it was different.
You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc?  If I was caught, wouldn't you?
I can handle it.
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
You bastard...
Fifteen minutes.
He must have.
A man helped me open it...
What do we do?
She's on TV.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
You sent me to him.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
I don't want to go there.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
Do you trust him?
I've never "been there... When we met it was in his office.
He might be ready to chop us up.
There are three men dead.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
Doc...
What about the bank?
... and live happily ever after.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
I mean it.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
Promise you won't laugh.
You know how I feel?
If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
For exits off Main Street.
Usually on the right side as you go in.
Want to cry now?
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.
I couldn't have... much longer.
You got the parole, didn't you?
$250,000 right off the top.
Suit yourself.
I bought you a lot of new things.
I was going to fix you breakfast.
How was it?
Really.
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
Sure.
We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you.
It's all right.
I'm still here, Doc.
After four years and now the question comes up.
No. It's been a long time.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
Fatter... some things never change.
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
How does it taste?
What do you want for dinner?
Half a million.
Assumed name... Houston.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Better than old times.
I've been doing my homework.
Small town, small bank, big money.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
Where do you want to go?
Feel good?
I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
Sure...
You want to drive?
You okay?
Hello, Doc.
We'll try again.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
No, I'm afraid not.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
No, I'm not.
Where's home?
That's right.
Tell her you robbed a bank...
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Oh my God.
I don't know nothing.
It is. Honestly.
It's the truth.
He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Once a week?
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
Yes.
Nicer than most.
He was all right to me.
I can't.
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
No. No. It's not like that. I've got a husband, you know.
She's nothing to do with me.
What about?
Everyhing go off all right?
No.
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
Your brother? What you talking about?
Expect so.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Shouldn't think so.
I don't know.
What girl?
You've been watching the film.
You sure about that?
That's why you waited for me.
Especially when I play the lead.
Now you're asking.
Entertaining.
He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
Brumby.
We're there now.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
Nasty.
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
To the demon king's castle, of course.
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
Could you please put my glass on the table?
Could you do me a favour?
He was here for four days.
Yes, while he was here.
We went about together.
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
Yes. I met him last year.
Yes.
Sid Fletcher.
I know him too.
Do you?
You know Sid Fletcher?
You know Sid Fletcher?
You coming back?
What you going to do?
And that'll make me feel better?
Not much.
What, and get myself beaten up again?
No. Are you tired?
Did you sleep well?
Uh-huh.
Do you want breakfast?
Are you awake?
What's that supposed to mean?
How'd you know I wouldn't?
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
You're a bastard.
What you going to do?
What about Keith?
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
And what about you? Did you kill Brumby?
They bloody hurt me.
What'll they do to him?
No.
You sod.
Now just a minute...
Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
I'll call the police.
And what you going to do?
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
Don't come that bloody flannel with me. If you're a traveller, I'm bloody Twiggy.  And who's he?
You don't look it.
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
It'll cost you.
Is he staying the night?
What is it?
Ta.
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
Will this do?
Are you a traveller?
It never is.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
I see.
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
What the hell does that mean?  Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life.  I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.
He's not the same as when I met him.
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
Am I a prisoner?
How long does this go on?
I'm going to see my parents.
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
Whose orders are these?
I'm going to the market.
Yes.
It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out!  It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil.  I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world.  An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!
The baby I lost...
You haven't heard me.
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
Michael.
Goodbye, Michael.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
You would have killed his brother?
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
Leave her alone!  You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.
It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
Yes, Michael, it does.
Sleeping inside me.
Yes, Michael.
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
What are you then?  What will you be ten years from now?  Still cutting lawns?  Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
Sure.  I loved it.
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
It still hurt.  A lot.
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
It never crossed your mind?
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
What's to be jealous of?
Weird.
Funny is funny and scary is scary. You don't mix them.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
This looks corny.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Just thinking out loud.
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
You are right.  Yes.  We must put him back.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
What have you done with him?
It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
What do I do?
I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
Yes.  I trust you.
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
You and he are not doing things?
You did not know?
That is why he must go to hell.  I do not think it fair.  But God's law is not for us to judge.
Yes!  You know?
What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.
No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
He is dead now, twenty years.
Of course.  I am married still.
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
Why?
Your wife?
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
Expect nothing fancy.
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
You will not hurt him?
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
The Master is waiting for you.
No.  I do not cook for them.  My daughter's no-good husband will not take one bite of our food.
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
No.  But someone you can talk to.
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
A visitor.
Of course.  This afternoon.
Good night.
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
She is horrible.
He is not going to kill the old man?
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
You remember what the doctor tells us.
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
Which ones?  I bring them all.
Mr. Kay, sir.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
What's that?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
This time it's for real?
I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and--  Where to -- ?
What are you doing... ?
You okay -- ?
Where to -- ?
How is he -- ?
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...
No worries ...
What about The Club ... ?
Wrong preposition...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
Cut 'em...
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
Woo-woo-wooooo!
"Unlock my button" ... ?
You're going high-cheese, dude --
Oh, God...
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...
I think so... They're just... So ...
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
So, you seeing anybody?
Deodorant.
What the hell's that -- ?
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
Oh, yeah.
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
No ... ?
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
We were good when you bailed, weren't we?
You mentioned that in your letters
That's what I want ...
I go with you --
She's trouble --
Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ...
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
The right side of the engine is running richer than the left. And the scope isn't showing shit... I dunno...
Hey.
Hey -
What the hell are you doing -- ?
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
And you got some Italians -- ?
What kind of trouble -- ?
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
A distinction worth noting ...
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
On account of me.
No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
Mitch.
Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
You look like you lost your sheep ...
What's with the look?
What are you doing here?
What about the schools?
I got scared.
I got seared.
Oh no! No!  Noooo!
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
I flushed it down the toilet.
What are you talking about?
Who's gonna do that?
Then you're safer in here.
I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
With what?
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
I can't do it anymore.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
He told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare.
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
Let her carry this shit inside.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
You son of a bitch. She's been here.
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
Henry.  Wake up.
I don't care. Something's going on.
I'm gonna need some money.
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
The bag with the envelopes.
My bag. My bag.
What are you gonna do?
They don't feel like you're in construction.
What do you do?
What're you doing? What about the car?
Talk? To you? After what you did!
Liar!
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
He's okay. They sobered him up.
Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
He's with his friends.
That's important.
I don't want them left back.
I got dry cleaning.
Is that true?
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
See, now this doesn't feel right.  When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
Okay.
Is this a bad time?
I guess so.
This is your house, right?
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
Good.
Hi.
I wanted to meet your brothers...
See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
Oh...
What class?
Okay.
Goodbye.
I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
I never cared about that.
You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
I don't want to "save" you. I just want to be with you. I love you. I love you!
Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?
Yes, I do, Will.
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
What about your twelve brothers?
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
Is that what you think--
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
Then what are you afraid of?
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
Why not?
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
Yeah, I'm sure.
I don't know. I just feel it.
I know. I just do.
I want you to come with me.
Come with me to California.
Will? Are you awake?
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
So, do you play the piano?
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
Come one Will. I just want to know.
Yeah. Someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars.
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
Just for fun?
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
Clearly.
It's important that I learn this.
No.
Fine.
I thought you said you'd show me your place.
You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
When?
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
I think I can make it to South Boston.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
I've never seen your place.
Why do we always stay here?
No.
I'm supposed to understand this.
How the hell did you do that?
If you bring the caramels.
You should have called. I have an "O- chem" lab due tomorrow and it's impossible.  It's not an excuse dummy. I want to go out with you. But look:
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
Where have you been?
I want to meet them.
Do you keep in touch with them?
Well...
Do you know all their names?
Your house must have been a zoo.
Bullshit.
Not a chance.
What, five?
How many?
Yeah.
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
I bet you have a great family.
How was that?
You grew up around here?
Free?
Then why don't we just get it out of the way.
Oh, you will?
Yes you were.
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
Well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing.
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
Okay...
Sure.
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
Sounds good, where are you now?
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
Yeah?
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
What?
Okay, sounds good.
What?
Here's my number.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
You suck.
Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
I'll get Rosasharn.
Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here, together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us--  --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!
But ef you *do* whup me, I swear you better not ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you're settin' down, or your back's turned, I'm gonna knock you belly-up with a bucket.
I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
Didn' you have no breakfast?
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
Hush!
No--an' look what I got for you.
You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
Stand by the door.
Anybody ask anything?
This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
Maybe that's jus' what he done.
No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people.
She'll be awright.
Don't matter. Just got to go--an' keep a-goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here.
They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place.
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
Pa! Shh!
Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.
Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
Go get Tom an' Al.  I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?
Good-by, Tommy.
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
I don't understan' it, Tom.
Then what, Tom?
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
He was a good man.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
I could hide you, Tommy.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
What is it?
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
Comes night we'll get outa here.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
They know he got hit in the face.
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
Looks like you done it.
How's it feel, Tommy?
You be careful, Tommy. Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything.
Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty.
No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
You know, I jus' can't remember when I felt so good before!
Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
You promised, Tommy.
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.
I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
Since before they stopped us las' night.
Granma's dead.
No.
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us.
Ya say we're acrost?
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here.  It put the chillun to sleep.
I'm ready.
Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son
Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
Sometimes they do.
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.
Thank God. Oh thank God.  Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you?
Other people can't.
You kill people.
That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
I'll hide.
I'm staying here.
That's probably a good idea.
You never could have kept this from me.
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Jesus Christ!
You're a government spook?
Get the fuck outta here.
Is it something you've done?
Not the other way around...?
He was trying to kill you, right!
Like love?
Like heroin?
No time.
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
Which would you rather...?
We haven't seen each other since high school.
What?
I think they'll probably have booze there.
...Let me get my coat.
Okay... Hold on...
Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
Flowers. That's funny.
You're fucking psycho.
Hello...?
Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time.
Are you there?
I'll think about it.
Unbelievable.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
Watched television?
You met people.
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
Yep.
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. The question now is, do I allow you... access... to my being?
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
Okay.
Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
What's your business?
That's it?
Tell me about yourself.
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
I just play my own collection.
Will do.
I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
You have.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
What's it look like?
This is not good.
Don't forget your identity.
Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be so easy.
Enough?
Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
They were very upset.
In Detroit. This weekend.
They blame you for the compromise.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
They're not happy, sir.
That's going to cost.
All of it?
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
This?
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
Of course you will.
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
We had a good laugh, didn't we?
You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
I have a headache. You have a headache?
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
Nature made him then broke the mold.
I spoke to your father the other day.
His assistant. He acted like Marlin's son, only he wasn't. At least they never said he was... I bet they were lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. Wild Kingdom my ass!
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
What's a revival tent?
I bought a new rug.
Why?
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
Why?
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
I can't do this. I can't leave you...
I don't care! We'd be together.
One more time.
Show me again.
Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --
I won't ask you to.
What?!
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
You missed a button.
I am comfortable.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
How did you find out all that?
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
It is. It's lovely.
Why didn't it work out?
How did you meet her?
Son?
How long did you live here with your wife?
OK.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Poor thing.
The answer's no.
I can handle it!
Shit.
You too.
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
She did?
He's beautiful.
Oh yes. I forgot.
I have a way with animals.
I thought you lived in Chicago?
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine.
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
You were married to a woman in Chicago?
You lived in Chicago?
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger.  You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that?
What?
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
It is cocktail hour yet?
Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
Look, I'll talk to Grace and call you later--
Well, that'll be a little complicated --
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
This is Annie MacLean.
Go ahead...
Great!
Hi.
Good.
How's everything?
So do you.
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
Tom's gone.
What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
Let's bring your bags inside.
Sure.
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Who is it?
So special. Because I was the only one. You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've completely ruined everything, anyway...
What?
I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be...
Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
Why should they?
That's not true.
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
What?... Oh baby...
Who's going to want me now?
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
When? Tonight?
My period.
Started what?
I said... I started.
What did you say?
LEAVE ME ALONE!!
Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
Well, now you know what it feels like.
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
Yeah, you know everything!!
Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...
Tom?
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
Grace, I don't hate your father.
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
What are you talking about?
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
Well...  So you tried riding again?
About what?
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
Did you go riding?
Nothing.
Thanks, honey.
I'll take care of it.
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
You're right. Good.
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Well, one was for salad...
I thought there were too many forks on the table.
Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
I'll come.
No. I just thought... forget it.
Why? There's no food in the house?
Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
You got everything you need?
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
Did he mention it?
You already did.
Did you ask him to come visit?
Hi.
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.
I think they call it a pasture.
He's still sitting in that damn field.
I didn't see it.
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Don't they believe in signs here?
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
Little.
You buckled up?  You cold?
No, you just act like you do.
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
Then why do you want to leave?
That's not true!
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
Did he tell you that?
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
I don't believe this!
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
You know what I mean?  Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
What?
How long is this going to go on?
You were never thirteen, Mom.
This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.
I don't care.
I don't care.
Would you like to see that?
You don't.
I didn't know I had to.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
Fine.
Fine!
Whatever you want.
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
I don't care.
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
Fine -- I'll take my bath.
You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?
What?
Maybe they should put me down too.
Yeah?
Mom?
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
What about him?
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
Doesn't matter.
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
No, you didn't.
I brought it to you in the hospital.
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
It's still early. What's your next class?
Fine!
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
Is that your version of a pep talk?
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
Oh, honey... What happened?
Okay.
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
Why don't you go lie down?
I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
Exactly...
David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you?
Yes. We're suing.
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
David?
Where to?
I have so much to tell you.
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
What do you mean?
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
I don't understa-
What do you mean?
Yeah, what?
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
Let's not talk about that now.
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
You're allergic to hay.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
About what?
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
Everything all right.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Night.
I know. We miss you too.
Okay.
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
Well, it's good that you're there.
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?
No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
She will if you think she should.
Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
Why?!
I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
No.
Yeah.
Why did you go?
How was the dinner?
Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time.
You've got to stop doing that?
Do you? Do you really?
Aw... that's so sweet.
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
Sing it to me, Frankie!
Oh. Right. I'll call him.
Okay.
We're very lucky.
No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up.
I should go get some of her things.
What did he say?
Tch. What are you --
Robert, you leave it up these people...!
That bag's almost empty.
What about Grace?
Yeah. Bye.
I don't know. We'll figure it out.
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
Sure... What's Grace up to?
I should be in by two.
Hi.
It's me.
What choice!!?
It's so cruel.
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
Oh, I don't know...
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
You too, Diane.
Good luck to you, Annie.
Promise.
Promise?
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
Oh, how sweet.
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
What?
Yes, it does.
Sounds like something Tom would say.
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
Frank's a good man.
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
Guess you don't have to figure it out until you go home.
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
You don't seem to upset?
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
They fired you?
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
I'd love to go there one time...
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
What was it like?
I was there for that shot, actually.
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
No reason you should, no reason you should.
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
I'll help you with the coffee.
Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.
Thank you. You're all doing too much.
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
She calls him Tommy...
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
Where does this go, Diane?
It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
No imposition. Plenty of food. Gonna get pretty dark soon. Hard to find a place.
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah.
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
Of course not.
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem!  I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay?  Please.
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
- See, what you can do for him --...
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
Well, of course, right...
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
Frank's touchy about his cousins.  Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean.
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
You!
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
What?
I guess they'll want feeding and all, out here all day long.
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
I have some brownies left over. Want one?
Ain't brain surgery.
Ha...
Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
You know, you're a good kid.
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
Of course I have.
Would you let me ride your horse?
Why do you always wear that hat?
Don't you go to school?
No!
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
I want to watch.
What does that mean?
Sure.
I can't... not yet...
I know where he goes.
Are you afraid of anything?
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
I don't know if I can.
I don't know if I can with my leg.
I can't...
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
That's not a question, is it?
Isn't it like, obvious?
Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
She's an editor.
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
Yeah?
Jude, you okay?
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
You want to go down or stay along the river?
Do you want to go around by the old road?
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
So?
You want to go to a movie tonight?
I did. He said he had work to do until late.
Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
Did you notice -- no cane?
I want to see Pilgrim.
NO!
Maybe... look -- just...
No, I'm just not that hungry.
Dad! I can do it, OK?!
How's Pilgrim doing?
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
Go fix the phones.
Cereal.
Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look...  "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers!
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Dreams?
Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
I can't believe they decided you won.
You would have looked better.
Oh, wow, she's great.
Thanks for your help.
Dade.
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
Alright, let's boot up.
Ready?
We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program.
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
They're elite! Let's get 'em.
There they are!
Alright, so what have we got?
It's my subway defense system.
How?
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
Why did he come to you?
You what?
What?
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Uh, hold on...
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that?
What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
We need your help.
I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
You're not gonna win.
Make it my first born.
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
If I win, you become my slave.
Are you challenging me?
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
It's too much machine for you.
What the hell are you doing?
You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
What?
He's not enrolled in this class.
He's not in this class.
What the hell is going on?
Think you can do better?
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
No, you're not in my class.
Here's your class.
Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
Colonel who?
Cancer?
What's happening?
You think they're going to bust us?
Phreak?
Hello?
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
What is he doing in here?
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.
"Minor glitch" with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
What is it? What's wrong?
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
You said the worm was untreaceable!
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
So?
Congratulations.
Pervert! What are you talking about?
Murphy kid turn you down?
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
I don't want to go to jail for this.
What?
What the hell was that all about?
So what are we supposed to do?
What, it left a note?
Excuse me?
Virus?
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Brady!
Brady!
Brady! Come with us.
Brady!
Brady!
What does that mean?
I don't know!
She's not dead!
Not without Jamie.
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
Michael Myers.
We've been better.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
You don't owe me anything.
I don't know Brady.
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
Don't get angry.
This morning.
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
Its about tonight.
We need to talk.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
You guys always look great.
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
Can't you find somebody else?
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
Mom, please
Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
Rachel!
I've got you come on, go down.
Rachel!
Well try dammit!
I can't.
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
Come on.
No.
Rachel come on.
Oh Rachel!
Jamie!
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
Can we go home soon Rachel?
Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Had enough?
This is great Rachel. Come on.
Jamie, wait for me.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
I thought you said you were ready.
Coming.
Come on Rachel!
Yeah, hurry up.
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
He's coming to get me Rachel.
What?
It was the nightmare man
Jamie, what happened?
In a second.
Come on Rachel.
You bet.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
You ready for some Ice Cream?
Hi.
Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.
Double scoops?
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
It's Halloween. I mean don't you want to get dresses up in a really scary costume and get some candy?
I don't want to.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.
I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
It's been eleven months.
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
Sure it does.
We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less.
Like a real sister?
Jamie, sometimes it's...
Like a sister?
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Do you love me Rachel?
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
I can't sleep.
Kido. It's four in the morning.
You don't believe that do you?
Then we'll be safe?
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
Don't you mean what you do best?
You knew. You just didn't care.
Hi.
Call me.
Jamie?
I don't know.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
I don't want to look pushy.
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
You remember Lindsay don't you?
Don't touch him Jamie!
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
Uh huh.
Okay.
Sheriff, what is going on out there?
What's going on?
He shouts, too.
You're going to be late!
Huh?
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you?
You blame everything on kids.
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
What happened?
What?
Hi, Dad. What happened?
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
Saving the treats for Bob?
What time?
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
We just talked.
That's not true. Here I am.
Why didn't you wait for me?
He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
Wait a minute here...
He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
Yes, you can.
I can't.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
Fancy.
Annie!
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
You guys will make a fabulous couple.
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
What's this big, big news?
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.
Thanks.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
What's the pumpkin for?
That's probably all he can do.
He can still watch.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
He was watching me.
Probably Mister Riddle.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
Lies.
I wasn't spooked.
You still spooked?
Bye.
Sure, see you later.
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
I've already lost it.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
Of course.
Annie, was that you?
Why did you hang up on me?
Hello?
Okay. Bye.
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
The guys think I'm too smart.
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
Cute.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
He was standing right here.
Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
I don't see anything.
Behind that bush there.
Look where?
Look.
Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
I forgot my chemistry book.
I have a place for that.
Shit!
Exploring uncharted territory?
I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
Come with me.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
Get him out of here!
Where?
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
You all right?
I'll check back in an hour.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
What do we do?
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
A man wouldn't do that...
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
Ten minutes.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
Lee Brackett.
Have a good time.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
I don't think so...
I thought you were babysitting tonight.
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
No! Do as I say.
I killed him...
Yes.
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
HURRY!
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
Tommy, let me in!
I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed.
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
I promise.
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
What did he look like?
There was no one outside.
Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
There is no such thing.
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
After the movie.
I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...
Why are they under there?
But king Arthur was always your favorite.
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
See you.
Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.
Just watch.
Yes, I am.
Sure. Sure.
Sure.
Sure.
Same time, same place.
Hi, Tommy.
Listen to me. I want you to walk down the street to the MacKensie's and knock on their door. You tell them to call the police and send them over here. Do you understand?
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
You've had enough. Why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of this movie.
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
What did he say?
Shouldn't we pick him up?
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
You don't have to make this harder than it already is.
What does that mean?
Only minimum security.
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
Are there any special instructions?
He'll barely be able to sit up.
What did you use before?
I can't believe it!
I love that.  That's my type.
He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?
Mmm?
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
Oh, listen...
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
Come in, come in.
Oh, good...
Mm-mm!
...any sister talk?
Great.
Yeah.
Uh --
A lot of works.
That's just --
Great.
Oh, yeah.
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Oh--
Yeah.
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
Oh.
Well, let's hope so.
Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.  I do the, uh, crêpes caviar.
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
But I'm seeing him.
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
And you, you-you're going?
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
No, he called late last night.
You're joking.
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
What?
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
I mean, it's jammed.  If we went... um...
Well, sometimes, some, uh...
If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?
Uh...
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
It depends on what way you want to go.
Uh...
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
Well, I live downtown.
Okay.
Oh, geez, yeah.
Yeah.
Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
It's really terrible.
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
That's disgusting!
It feels like you're in France.
Yeah.
It's French, though.  It really is.
It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean.  I-I... I can't put it into words.  The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes.
Right.
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Oh, is that what it is?
Oh!
Oh, it's magnificent!
Wow, it's the red one?
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
We're a big hit.
Mmm.
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
No, really, I really like him a lot.
I mean, I've looked everywhere.
I know.  It's terrible!
Oh, okay.
Yes.
Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...
Fast.
Yeah.
And it ruins everything else.
Yeah.
...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
Uh-huh.
It's terrific!
Yeah.
Oh, what, what do you do?
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
What makes you think we're more interesting?
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
Really?  Is the food that bad?
We're actresses.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
Uh-huh.
Yeah?
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
Hi, Dusty.
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
I've got to be honest with you.  I met someone else.  I've met someone else.  I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
No.
I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
I know she must be a really passionate person.
Oh, all the time.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
I know it isn't.
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
I didn't sleep all night.
I almost didn't.
Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
I can't say anything!
Poor Hannah.
But not over me?
Why?
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Not because of me, I hope.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
What do you expect me to say?
Why, you know the situation.
Oh, don't say those words!
Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
I was looking for you.
Elliot!
What are you doing?!
Elliot!  Don't!
Did you ever read this one--?
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
Yes, he's just adorable.
Isn't that beautiful?
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
Yeah.
Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
Oh.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
Bye.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
Well, thanks a lot.
Well, sure.
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
No, I don't think so.
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
I'm...all right.
Everything's okay?
Yes?
No?
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
No, I don't have time.
Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT  What?  Book?
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, you would.
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Oh, God.
Yeah, unhappy and fat.  And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
Yes, I do.
Oh.  Well, I live--
Ohhhh!
You're out looking here?
Oh, what, in this section of town?
What are you doing here?
Oh, Elliot!
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
I don't know exactly.
Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture.
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
You matter to me.  Completely.
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving?  Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
What, you, of c-- What are you talking about?  Of course not.  I'd be destroyed!
Are you?
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
Are you in love with someone else?
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Are you angry with me?
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
I want one with you.
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
Why not?
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Are you in a bad mood?
It's so late.
Where're you going?
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
Mmm.
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
I know.
Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
She has all the cooking talent.
I know!  I know!
Aren't they great?
Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
Oh, Mom!
It's on the table, Dad.
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
Don't make it worse, Dad.
Hi.  How's she doing?
...just for a second.  So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
I am... I did slave all day.
Get his wine away.
Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean...  it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this!
Yeah.
I'm saying it now!
I'm sorry.
Stop accusing me!
No.
No.
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Because I have to!
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
I can't take this anymore.
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
What's the problem?
Oh, Frederick!
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
Based on what?  You never even see him.
Me?
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.
Mm-hm.
...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else.
Mmm...
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
Mmm, what am I gonna do with you?
Are you sure?
How about something to eat?
Want some coffee or tea?
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
I know, I know, and your hamster.
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
No.
Yes, please.
Yeah.  What?
You're just realizing this now?
Yeah...but you're not dying!
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
It was on your shirt!
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
But you don't have any symptoms!
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
Well, he has to rule out certain things.
But there's nothing wrong with you.
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
But not you.
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
Hello?
Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
Yeah?
In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
Yeah.  I'll get some ice.
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.
I think we need to eat.
Yeah?
I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
She's going through a really rough time right now.
Oh, now--
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
Like what?
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
Oh...
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Really?
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
Y-yeah.
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
I'm okay.
How are you?
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
No.
Do you miss Frederick?
Oh, me, I'm okay.
So how are you?
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
Why?
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
Hi.  Where's Holly?
He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test.
Oh, yeah?
I bumped into your...
Doesn't she look pretty?
Come on.
You look so beautiful.
Oh, great.
Okay.
Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
You've outdone yourself.
I think they're fantastic.
Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
Just think about it.  That's all I ask.
I want to experience childbirth.
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
Well, what about artificial insemination?
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
This is the second opinion.
Is there no chance?
Wow!
Football!
Oh!
That's a beauty!
Thanks, thanks.
You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
That's really nice!
I know, I know.
Ohh!
Yeah.
I think so.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
He's fine.
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Huh?
Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
Very good.
Glad you could put in an appearance.
Hi!  Hi!
True.
Now, Holly's not shy.
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA  But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.  He's all show!  Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
Okay, okay.
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
You promised to stay on the wagon.
Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
...from Mavis, also.
No, he hasn't.  If I offended you, I'm sorry.
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
Well, why don't you share them with us?
Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this conversation.  I didn't do anything wrong.
You're grateful, but you resent me.
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?
Well--
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
Oh, so loosely.
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
My script?
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
Hey, what's the matter?
Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
Good.
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
What's the matter?
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
You're crazy!  That's not true.
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
You're too demanding.
Uh, losers!  All losers!
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
Hmm!
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
You never have any faith in my plans.  You always undercut my enthusiasm.
How?
You treat me like a loser.
Yeah, you mean not at my age.
I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer."  I mean--
Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
No.  She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department.  That-that can lead to other things.
Yeah, that's clerical.
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
Well-well, like what?
Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
Well, that...th-that's fine.
Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money.
Oh, God...
You got it.
Oh, gosh.
Oh, what do they know?
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Boy--
So what's new?
Awwww...
Well, I just came from an audition...
Hey, hi!
Look, everything's going your way.
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Tch, well, I sing!  For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
I hope.
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it.
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
Yeah.
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
Easily.
Uh-huh.
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean that.  No, I didn't mean that.
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
I know, no--  I know.
You know.
Ohh!
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Really?
Yeah, can you believe it?
Singing?
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
You found all this, all this out on one date?
...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so...
Oh?
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
Oooo.
Sometimes she's terrific...
Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.
He's married...
Oh, yeah.
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
Well, how about this?
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
Oh!
Ouch!
Maybe at Christmas, New Year's.  If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.
Here.  Be careful with those.
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Oh, he's such a loser!
He's not a loser at all!
He's such a loser!
It's, uh, you never know--
Oh, Hannah!
Oh, your kids are so adorable.
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
Tch.  He's such an angry...he's such a depressive.  I thought she was moving out!
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Frederick didn't come with her.
I should get a garter belt.
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
She really does, though.
Don't you think she does?
Yeah.
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
Uh-oh.
Ohh?
I swear.  I swear.  We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
Are we talking about cocaine again?
Okay.
Will you just tell me one thing?
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
Yeah.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
Uh-huh.
Two thousand dollars.
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Oh, sure.
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
Perfect!
No, no, we decided!
What?  You're kidding!
I'm pregnant.
Mickey?
Tch.
Thanks.
Just a few minutes ago.
Okay.
Hi.
Yeah.
Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
It's all right.
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
Y-you used to-- Oh, no!  Yeah, I care.  You used to be so ambitious and...  God, you really liked it?!
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
Oh, wow!
Oh, God!
Oh!
Right.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Really?
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
Oh, well.
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know.  I don't know.
...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Oh, I'm fine.
You're okay, though, huh?
Oh.  Oh.
You're kidding me.
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
No, I haven't.
No, the reason I ask is--
Really?
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
Come on.
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
Yeah.
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Probably not.
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
I'm okay.
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
People change...you know.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
I'd never do that.
Yeah, it was.
Yeah?
Oh, no.
I'm fine.
How are you?
We didn't hit it off.
Yeah.
I recall you.
I remember you.
God!
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
At least I'm open to new concepts!
I was so bored!
Thanks for a swell time.
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
No!
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
You want some?
Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy!  The room's alive with positive vibrations!
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
Oh, why are you making those faces?
You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating.
Why are you so upset?
I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
Boy...Holly...Holly.
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
Hmm.
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
April?
Thanks.  But guess who was there auditioning?
...which I did not get.
Hi.
Dad!
Oh...
Dad...
Where are the antihistamines?
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
Yeah.
God.
Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
Mm-hm.
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
No, you're wrong about Verger.
Who would that be.
And why is it a vacant exercise?
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
...they did it for a lark.
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
You want me to be?
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
Then who's buying it?
Say it in English.
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
Now, whyn't you help us?
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
I'm looking for...
...you...
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
What have they got you doing?
...how are things at the Hospital?
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
It wasn't my day.
Well.  Word gets around.
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
I hereby acknowledge that...
I have not read you your rights.
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
What, What, I can't hear you...
I know her by the Back.
All Quiet Along the Potomac...
Then I'm doing fine.
M'I gonna see you tonight?
Hard up as you are, at your age?  Whadda <u>you</u> care?  Surrender.
How <u>crazy</u> is that....
How crazy is that.
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're...
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
Then you tell me, then.
I'm not.
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
All y'got to do is <u>ask</u>...
COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
Hey, I'm fine.  Whaddizit, you, how's your day, our gallant International Neighbors...?
Tell him to give it to an orphanage.
No, no, of course not.
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
And how would you know that?
He is...?
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
What reaction?
Now, why in the world would he do that?
What would <u>that</u> be?
I won't take much of his time.
I've never heard that he...
The children...?
Reinstatement to <u>what</u>?  There ain't nobody there...
I know you did what you could.
I am all attention.
Yes sir, I saw it.
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
Am I on that case, sir...?
...standard issue...
...what'm I looking at...?
You seen John Brigham...?
He once made me an improper suggestion.
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
One moment, and they're at the <u>Seven-</u> <u>Eleven</u>.  They botched the fallback plan, they...
I don't mind being the token <u>woman</u>, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token <u>man</u>... who are these Warriors, ¥our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm in the room with a fugitive felon...
..I was <u>instructed</u> that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special...
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Sir:
Give it up.
Give it up, Evelda.
Waal...
I said how's your baby...?
How's your <u>child</u>?
I said sometime it gets so...
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
I'm an orphan.
....I didn't realize I said it out loud.
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning.
That, that was <u>business</u>...
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>...
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
Well, perhaps sometime we...
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
You know it?
My husband brought it to me from America.
And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
...may be the heat....
You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse <u>TaskForce</u>...  Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir?
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
...spend some time on the streets.  Ask me then...
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
Sir, with all due respect....
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
And how did he do that?
...and my need for The Institution...
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
What is that that smells so wonderful.
Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
Give me your gun...
Why?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
No.
...what...?
Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
I met a man, and His Troubles Were Greater Than Mine...
No.  I want to buy a dog.
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
...not to turn around.
I am no going to show you the <u>secret</u> <u>handshake</u>!
Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>...
Yeah, but who would marry friendless <u>me</u>...  Howabout you, Romeo...?
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
No, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....
Oh baby, oh baby....
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
I want the <u>same</u> drink.  Cause it did me <u>good</u>... but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like another.
...get me a cigarette.
...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...
Oh, my <u>program</u>...
It's a <u>joke</u>.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
....because we don't have any mmm...
Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
Then we cannot go.
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>...
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
...and that is what you need to expand.
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them...
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
...this one is my favorite.  It has not title.  They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?
Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin <u>home</u>, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to <u>take</u> her there...
Or clear your windshield with it.
No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you.
Hey, lost again.
Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
But they were not there.  <u>Yesterday</u>.  Is that called a Delusion...?
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
And all he <u>left</u> us:  the Country brought back his <u>hat</u>, and his <u>badge</u>... both with a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he left us.  That's what I said.
He was <u>shot</u>...he was shot.  On his rounds.  And... and...
...why?
Yes.
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
I..
What is your point?
Yes.
That's right.
I don't understand.
But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"--
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
Yes.
For approval.
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
Yes.
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but...
...no.
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
...no...
...no...
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
I don't <u>think</u> so.
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
....that's right.
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
...sir...?
<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head.
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction...
No.
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
Now what? What did I do this time?
Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...
Yeah. And?
This is not the way it was supposed to-- I was going to start writing a children's book using input from all-- I don't even like smoking!
I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
I'm not a nai-ive little...
Why do you even like me?
Geez, what time is it?  I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right, I miss him. Wichita, that is.  I really want to be with him, but I can't bring myself to--Are you a lesbian or are you...
You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.
What are you doing?
I just don't know about this whole actual sexuality thing--How do you go from being friends with a guy to wanting to put the thing he uses to go to the bathroom with in your mouth?
I don't know about you dickweeds, but I gotta go take a nice, long juicy dump.
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
Well, the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and I thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow. I think we should discuss--
Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up!  Isn't Fun great!
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
Yes!  God yes!  I would tell her that I love her!  To not let anyone take away her dreams..!
Yeah, why should we let our actual personalities get in the way of us falling in love?
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
Iunno.  Of course I believe you. It's so you...I didn't think it was possible                        ] for you to make me feel worse,                              ] but...you're saying you <u>deliberately</u>                        ] destroyed us!

Something more interesting than that...How could you?  How could--!
Ah, our last night at camp...I always knew it would be something special.
This isn't about "doing it." I just think we need to talk some things out privately before...
Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...
Be nice. Her father died in that TWA flight the government shot down...You know I'm going to be in the city next week. My mom says it's okay that I stay overnight at your dorm...It'll be nice to see you in                          ] a different shirt.                                          ] ] WICHITA                                            ] Oh, I didn't tell you.

Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
Oh my gosh, why didn't you say something earlier...
Are you allowed to do it more than once a night?
Probably.
Fuck off.
Don't worry, you...
I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too."
And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.
Don't be. Don't be sorry for your thoughts. They make me...react. I don't know...all I know is that I can't go through another summer where I <u>almost</u> did something.
Iunno.
What else don't you believe in?
Do you really not believe in God?
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
I think your condescension is even better.
Ann Taylor would have paid a lot more, but I wouldn't trade this experience for the world. Sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger-- You think I'm a big dork don't you?
Yeah. I guess I do.
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...
Hey.
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
It's not my style, okay?
Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.
Shoot.
That's bullshit. Just shoot.
Don't get cocky, girl.
Don't say that.
I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.
Betty Finn. Gosh.....
You don't deserve my fucking speech!
I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice....
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.
Gee, thanks.
No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
I'm sorry? I don't get it.
I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her!  What are you smiling at?
Oh, I have to hear this.
You're beautiful.
Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep.
Because you're an idiot.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
All right.
Because you're an idiot.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
All right.
Things are going to change, Earl.
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
Something like that. Will you do it?
What are you doing here?!
Heather? Wha...
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
You goddamn bitch!
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
Never say never.
Geez, don't listen to them.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
I was talking with someone!
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
I'll think about it.
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
Yeah, I just got back.
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
No.
Don't talk to me like that.
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
You're not funny. Ouch!
I said I was sorry.
Is she dead?
Heather.
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
Maybe you should see a doctor.
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
Sure.
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
Uh-huh.
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
Give it up girl!
Give me the clipboard.
Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...
I thought I...you..
You know what I want, babe?
The bomb, asshole!
How do you turn the fucker off?
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.
No-o!
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless.
This knife is filthy.
You're still not listening! I'm not..
Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
It's over, J.D.  Over!
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
We're breaking up. I am out!
May<u>be</u>.
Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for...
You can be so immature!
Don't <u>even</u> talk about that stuff!
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
Can't you see this is a special moment?
Your son's dead and you love him.
Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
Did not.
Did not.
I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
We killed them, didn't we?
Kurt doesn't look too good.
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
You must have had fun.
Oh.
Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
French.
You can't be serious? Hey listen, my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.
I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Yeah. Scary stuff.
Next channel, darling.
That's good. Have you done this before?
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
"You might think what I've done is shocking..."
I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.
Like a suicide thing?
It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
You're not funny.
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
There's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
Killing her won't solve anything.
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
S'okay....
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
I don't know. Should you?
I didn't. Cherry.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
How very.
If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?
All we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized.
Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
Superb.
Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow.
May<u>be</u>.
Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
May<u>be</u>. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.
I guess.
Get a job.
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
But my name's not...
That's three things.
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
I adore anything to do with the arts.
I'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
Bye.
breaks down into heavy sobs.
She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
Is it hurting, dear?
frowns at Henry.
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
playfully shoves his hand away.
looks down at the ground in front of her.
Look, Mother!
Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
You have it.
That's enough, Yvonne!
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
Love, you can still write to each other.
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
stands and walks toward the door.
You have to let me go!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
Open this door!
I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
is very angry.
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
I'm educating myself!
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
Who cares!
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
What does old Stew want?
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
My name is Gina!
steps back.
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
Well, I guess I take after you then!
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
Can I go now?
sighs.
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
Her parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. Don't worry about Juliet.
But she'll have no one to look after her!
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
I'm not hungry.
Come on, sit up.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
He's the manager!
glows with pride. STEVE is emptying his pockets on the bench. HONORA pats STEVE's hand.
Got an A, Mum!
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
Hello!
I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
Fruit.
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
Oh-what a nice outfit!
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
Hello!
Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
looks startled at the outburst.
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
gives her a sympathetic look.
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
That's coming along well!
Thank you so much!
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
hurries over.
I'm so happy to see you!
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
Isn't it beautiful!
Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
Bye, Dad.
I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
All right, then.
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
Mummy!
Mummy!
I know what to do about mother.
Yes . . .
I'm coming with you.
I need my sodding parents' consent.
But that's not true! I've got one.
Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
Poor Father . . .
Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
That was what we were led to believe . . .
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
Just a couple more . . .
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
You mean travel by ourselves?
Let's go overseas . . .
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
I think I'm going crazy.
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
How do you know? Did he tell you?
That idiot boarder?
John has fallen in love with me!
What??
You'll never guess what's happened!!
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
You're such an incredible woman.
I shall call him Diello.
What???
It's so beautiful!
What?
God, yes!
He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!
That . . .
That.
This . . .
This.
Him . . .
Him.
He . . .
To be known as He!
Saint Mario!
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
But, we're all going to Heaven!
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
I think I'm dying . . .
Of course it matters! It's Mario!
It doesn't matter.
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
Somebody's got to help us!
She's terribly hurt . . .
Mummy!
Mummy!
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Just get better okay?
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
No.
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
Sure plenty of times.
Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?
Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
I understand, I think. Other women?
You just made that up.
Eighty third most common.
Second most common?
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Okay so... what's the safest place?
Bull...
I'm stumped.
All finished.
I know, my bedside manner's horrendous.
Of course, yes.
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
I'm all over it.
Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
No wisdom, no insight, no plan.
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
Your wife...?
It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
I only married you for your body.
And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan
Never to put you in my will.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
THE BABY IS COMING OUT! I CAN FEEL IT! SONOFABITCH IT HURTS!! AAAGGGGHHH!!!
Oh my God. It's coming out.
Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick-tock...
You win! Okay pull over.
Uh... eighty two?
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
You mean John Bubber?
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
"The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
It's November.
How recently?
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
I got your bail continued.
Mister LaPlante... Bernie... I... just for a few moments... I want to be a human being, not a reporter. I'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and I looked up, and some man came out of the smoke, his face smeared with mud, and soot and... and he... saved my... life. Off the record.  Was it you?  Why would you deny it if it was? Because you took my purse?  Why?
Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
I snuck in.
Well, for your child's sake, show some decency then, rise above your sleazy instincts.  You may have already killed him!
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
All this is off the record, Chucky, because if John Bubber lives, Mister LaPlante is going to give him his assurance that there will be no more "misbehavior" on his part.  What's more he's going to apologize.
In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
Here!  Here... ten, thirty, fifty bucks.  How much have you got, Chucky?  Give Mister LaPlante your money.
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
No, John, you're too hard on yourself.  I've got the creep here, the guy who's...
John, I know all about it.
It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
There, like that.  Kind of, uh, sexy.  You can support me anytime, John.
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life...
Read it.  It'll be fine.
You were... very... inspiring.
Goodnight, John.
I know the truth, John.  I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them live on network hookup!
No, I don't have the right.  You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
You did save my life!  And it's <u>me</u>! I'd be taking advantage of <u>you</u>! I'm a reporter, John, an experienced professional...  I...
I... I know that, John...
Years?  There are going to be lots of... opportunities.
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.
You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
...unworthy of the adoration.  We all do.
Instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody.  <u>You've</u> known John Bubber all your life, you're used to him, you know you're the same human being you were before all the excitement.  So you feel like a fraud...
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?
Did you get it?  Jesus, did I say that?
He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first.
There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?
A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
Hello, Mister Wallace.
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
He's pretty... remarkable.
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
Who?
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
What about?
Mr. Sykes, I think you should go home.
About what?
Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
Uh huh.
Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
You must value your independence.
Do you have a family?
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
Oh, that's fine.
So, you're just kind of a roving --
Everything breaks at once.
Do you do washing machines, too?
Oh, great.
Well, can I make an appointment?
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  Well, of course I know <u>you</u> can.  No, Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line.
Holly -- that's not so.
Yes, he did, and I don't like it any more than you do.
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.
A man?  Was it a dream?
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
Aw, okay.
Baby, what is it?
Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
I've asked him what's wrong.
No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?
Honey --
Neil -- what --
He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
He doesn't have a temperature.
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
Here, take this out to the table.
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
C'mon, kids, let's go.
We'll talk in the morning.
Oh God.
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
I'm having the floor fixed,
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
"Honey, I'm a zombie, I don't know whether I'm coming or going."
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
That's not the case.
Honey, it's not the end of the world.  You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up.  And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own.  You are free now, you are independent.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
Oh, honey.
What?
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
Oh baby.
Philip!  The senior partner?
Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
Yeah -- she did a good job.  This glass looks brand-new.
Did you lock the garage door?
Where should I hide the car keys?
I thought we'd be happy here.
Fuck you, Philip.
There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Well, what about <u>these</u>?  Do you usually put your <u>carbons</u> in your pocket, too?!
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.
Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.
I know someone else who's sensitive.
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
How long does it have to be a new house?
I hear things in this house,
There's no card or anything.
Do you remember who gave us this?
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
How was your lunch with Charlie?
How was lunch?
It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics.
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
Honey, are you okay?
What?
What?
<u>Now</u>, Neil.  Stop teasing your sister.
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
We're going to think about it.
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
And it's a shorter commute.
You could have a pool to cool off in.
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
But it's what we want.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
Two -- three if you count the husband.
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
Just reduced.
Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
Yes.
Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
They appear to be authentic.
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
Lieutenant?
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
Paul.  I thought we agreed.  No press.
You guys are from the British museum, right?
Huge.
Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
Sounds very -- normal.
What now?
Be careful, Conner.
He's in there!
Must you fight him?
Where will you go now?
And the other one -- he is like you?
You?
How did you know that?
On the back it has--
Would you like to see it?
Not unless they're immortal.
--for three hundred years.
Yes -- if they were trying to get in -- but what if they weren't?  What if they were trying to get out?
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
No.
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
Yes -- it is.
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
You're not an easy person to get to know.
I'm just trying to place you.
You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
You didn't answer my question.
You're twenty minutes late.
Why?
Yes.
You look like you have.
Have you ever heard of the Calan?
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
Then how did he know your name?
Who was that man last night?
Why do you stare at me like that?
Jennifer.
Then who's Russell Nash?
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
You're hurt.
It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
Why?  What's going on?
If it's good advice.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Yes.  How did you know?
Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
To talk to you.
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--
We'll see.
I like my work.
I know, Paul.
I was working on the cataloging.
And this?
I don't think it is a duplication.
His head.  Someone cut it off.
We found him this morning.
I don't know.
He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
We're holding the workers down below.
Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
Oh, my babies.
What's wrong?
Please do not talk like this.
What sort of plan?
We are almost out of water.
Paul! Then another voice.
Let me go. Children get off.
No! Sit down now.
No.
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
A little longer, Paul?
Please, please try one more time.
I will not leave without the twins.
A Volkswagen!
I want to know.
What sort of car?
Tell me what it was.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
Why?
What?
Yes.
In Ruhengeri?
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
You cannot go alone.
No, no.
Go out! Where?
What's the matter?
So where is the lamb?
What for Paul.
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
You could leave, Paul.
But who is left?
What about us?
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
Please go back, bring the children to us.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
No, Odette says he's in shock.
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
It will do just fine.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
Paul, don't let them die.
What is it, Paul.
Oh, my God!
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
I tried already. The phones do not work.
Where are Thomas and Fedens?
The president has been murdered.
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
They do not have your connections.
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
You could have asked for a favor.
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
We must do something.
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
Do something.
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
Of course.
He wants your wisdom.
Yes, with Fedens and the children.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
-- the whole thing is falling apart!
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
So what stopped her?
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
And what's Steven's status?
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
No need for divorce and that messy division-of-assets thing when they kick before you do.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't "believe" in divorce.
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
C'mon.
-- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me.
More the merrier.
Yeah...something.
-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
Looks like we're it.
What?
I don't do groups.
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
Run.
All the plates sealing the windows and doors -- there's got to be some way of raising them manually. They didn't just appear out of thin air -- there's got to be pulleys, cables or something, that make them go up and down.
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
-- was that??
We're safe?
He's dead...?
He's gotta still be down here.
It'll have to do.
What about that other guy?
Or an on-line computer.
Everyone that was invited is related to one of the staff who was here when the place burned. There are five of us...
Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
Cheery looking bunch.
Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
Let's try down here...
Back where?
-- listen to the man --
-- where the hell were you?
I was upstairs with Eddie --
You're starting to sound like Pritchett.
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!
We can do it...
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
Hey, if everybody's gonna kill each other, could you do it in another room? I'm trying to get something accomplished here.
No...not air --
There's always exceptions.
Why not?
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
What? Deep down inside?
You need to get out more.
Thanks.
This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
Don't push it.
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
Is she...alright?
Steven??
No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house <u><b>IS</b></u> haunted.
-- wit...nesses --
-- what...are...you...going...to --
Steven --
Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
Question answered.
-- thank you! All the cards finally on the goddamn table!
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
-- and who's next on your list?
I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?
Stalking the wild poltergeist.
Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.
-- the sadistic prick --
Really? Well, let it rip.
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab.
You're hurting me.
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
All accidents until proven otherwise.
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
Then who are they?
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
Could we have a word?
Haven't they already?
I'm not laughing, Steven.
Don't touch me!
Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
What?
No, no, it's just --
I was in the middle of --
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
-- no more --
-- confirming everything we already know --
I'll take my chances.
Well, I don't.
Fascinated.
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
I never saw you --
-- the window and door grates --
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
What is it??
Good way to get your head blown off.
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
What're you talking about?
Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
-- hey! --
How, he's supposed to be dead!
Pritchett: what is going on?
Price!
Excuse me?
You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
There is something very not normal going on here!
And you think it's in there?
Ghosts killed your father?
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it's spend-the-night-sleep-tight.
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
Why not?
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
What's going on?
Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
But the million bucks each, that's for real?
-- I'm coming --
Keep talking, I'll find you!
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
Melissa...?
-- Eddie!!
I'm ok mommy.
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
Go to your room!  Now!
H-how long will it take?
We'll get it later.
What about all my other stuff?
We're going to go someplace new.
Where are we going to go, mommy?
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
Are we leaving mommy?
I'm scared!
My angel!
Ok...
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
She's down...how do you mean honey?
She's down...
She talks to me.
Can you talk to her?
Yes.
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
No it won't - no it won't!
It's going to hurt us!
Who...is Colleen?
Maybe it was Colleen...
Well then who did?!
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Don't play games with me, little girl.
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
Can I do it again tonight?
Well I bet you they're happy.
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
Sure.
Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?
Help me!  Please!!!
She's down.  Help her...
She's hiding.
She's here.
She says she's lonely...
Mommy!
Good night daddy.
Are we going back to California daddy?
Daddy help!
Daddy, please!!!
Mommy please help me!
I can't move!
It's dark!  I can't breathe!
Look daddy!  It's empty!
Did you ever see a leprechaun?
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
Why?
What's he doing daddy?
I want this one, daddy.
Can I have this room daddy?
You're bleeding.
I'm ok.
What's happening!
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
We're not going.
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
Do you think I'm a fool?
You don't think I know?
Should I...
I'm fine.
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
Aubrey!
She's gone!
Oh my God where is she!
Good.  I'll start bringing things in.
How are we doing?
You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
Are you ok?
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
What about keeping an open mind?
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
Well what do you think it is?
But do you agree with me?
I don't know what I'm saying.
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
Well something just happened to the power upstairs... Maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event -
What is it?
Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!
Were you fooling with the power?
Ok.
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
What the hell is that?
It's not going to work.  I'm too smart for you.
Are you playing tricks on me?
I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  She didn't even know who I was.  It's just... tradition.
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
I wish I knew more about her.
To our family.
It's just going to take a while.
You didn't think much about that before.
Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
I just, I don't know...
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
Must be...
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
You'll have to settle for turkey.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
Maura.
Before.
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
What about the other five percent?
What do you mean, unfortunately?
I think we should do it.
We don't know.
Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
Come back to us honey!
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
Aubrey?  It's mommy.
So what should we do, father?
Why?
What!
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
It was a shame.
Did you know her very well?
Oh, that's nice...
Yes, I am.
No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
I know what I saw.
Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
Jesus Christ ...
What do you mean?
Doc?  ...  Doc ... Hello?
Hello?
That is the story of my life.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.
Wha .... ?
So where is it?
Then tell me what to do.
I don't know ...
What can we do?
What will he do?  What does he want?
Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
And why are you back?  Why are we here?
And what did you discover?
And what is ... this frozen moment?
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.
Joey ... ?
God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
What am I looking for?
Here!  Here!  Pull over!
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
Oh, Terri ...
Buying some drugs, alright?
Terri?
What on earth were you doing down here?
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
Sure.  Why?
Would you know this store again?
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
But I don't know what's going on.
No.  He knows it won't.  It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet.
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
Every day.
And he still sits there?
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Who's that?
... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ...
I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ...
Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
How have you ... ?
Jeez, I've never owned anything.  I haven't even had a room of my own since I was fifteen years old.
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
No!  No, that's OK.  I like to.  I love boiling water.  It's a specialty of mine.  Why don't you go watch cartoons?
I'll do it!
I'll boil some water.
Ha!  I don't know yet.  First time. Kitchen virgin, that's me.
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
I figured I'd make breakfast.
That's what I'm trying to tell you! ...
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
Taken what?
No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
Did you know him?
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?
I'm trying to quit.
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream?  No, you know, you do.  You must.  What you mean is you don't remember them.
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
What?
That's great.
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
Sorry.
Why are you so interested?
What is it?
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
Oh yeah ...
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
What?
Right.
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was having bad dreams anyway.
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... Look, I'll make a deal with you ... My boyfriend threw me out, right?  I'll trade you. You give me couch-space.  I'll give you talk.  OK?
I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
Right.  Right!
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
Joey.  Yeah, who is this?
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Uh-huh?
Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
Where?
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
What happened to him?
It was off the statue.  In the club.
I don't know.  Maybe.
Can we see?
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
No.  We want ...
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
But you gave me a rose ...
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
Wow.  Thank you.
No.  Really?
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
I'm sorry.
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
A prize?  For what?
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.
You're JP Monroe, right?
Really?
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
Yeah right.  Look ...
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
Not quite.  This wasn't here.
Oh, I don't ...
Yes. 53
I miss you too.
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
You're apologizing?
Yeah really.  I'm ...
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
What do you want?
JP?
Joey?
Guards come exactly every three minutes....
Gum.
It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.
That was beautiful.
Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...
Something like that.
Oh thank God, you're dead...
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
I'm going to find out.
You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
A little petting is not the issue!
He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around...
I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.
Yeah.  The big E.
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
Wha -- you don't want to know...
Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?
Trust Leonardo....
Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
Oh Hudson...
Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I....
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
It's from the machine.  All they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already.  We can't let that happen.
Where did you get this?
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Hudson, don't you understand...
Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
The C.I. what?  God, no...
For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
What are your plans for the weekend?  Hoisting away the Colosseum?  Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
It's also been a long time for me.  I--
I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....
Oh, I'm so sorry...
What have you been doing?
Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
How long were you in?
Prison?
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
I'll bring my entire repertoire...
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
Question, sir?   His untiring pen predicted the airplane, the submarine, the bicycle, the helicopter, and even the tank.
As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.
Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
Cat got his tongue?
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
...Hello?
I'm plenty happy!
I'm happy enough.
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
It's hardly the same --
Well, maybe I --
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
That smart?!
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
Who are you? How did you know who I am?
Muncie!
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
I know they're gonna buy that stock --
On Norville Barnes!
A sawbuck!
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
Lumbago.
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
Oh Norville, I --
Norville!
Consider this my resignation --
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?!
Your i --
You mean you know about this?
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
Never mind about that...
For Pete's sake, Norville!
Sure, Norville, sure...
Oh, Norville --
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
What a beautiful thought.
...The people look like ants.
Well -- this year -- if it's good I plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my it certainly is beautiful --
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
Oh yes! In Muncie!
...Huh?
...Certain people are --
Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
...You do?
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
...I'm sorry.
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
Let me look.
...What happened?
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
Smitty.
Oh, is that it!
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Confused?
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
...Why don't I just type this up...
Well, I --
I'm sure I --
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
-- or lack thereof?
Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
Oh, no, really, I --
Why yes, do you know it?
-- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --
No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world --
What a horrible little person.
I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
The couch, please.
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
I filed it yesterday.
...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.
Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?...
As a three-dollar bill.
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
Says who?!
You can't print that!
It's about a dimwitted editor who --
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Muncie.
I don't know...
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
Yes, Miss Betsy.  I mean that.  The Houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to Shango and Damballa.
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
That's nonsense, Alma.
At the Houmfort.
Where?
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
Things so bad, nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell.
Looks like an awful lot of breakfast -- I don't know whether I'll be able to get away with it.
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
What's this?
I do my best.  Every day I dress her just as beautifully as if she was well.  It's just like dressing a great, big doll.
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.
Thank you, Alma.
I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.
I didn't want to frighten you out of your sleep, Miss.  That's why I touched you farthest from your heart.
Thank you for waking me.
Good morning, miss.
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
You mean a figurehead.
Alive?
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
Mrs. Rand was at the Houmfort that night.  But there's nothing wrong with that.  She's gone there for years -- trying to take care of those people,  to help them.
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
Mrs. Rand...
That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
Perhaps not.  But I did come here and I found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me. Once started, it seemed such an easy way to do good.  I should have known there was no easy way to do good, Betsy.
But you didn't have to come up here.
-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.
I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
But, Mrs. Rand --
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
Mrs. Rand.
Her son drowned.  She brooded until her mind was affected. All the Houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology.
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
You don't believe in it?
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
I'd love to.
So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
Nonsense, child!  I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately.  I know a great deal more about what goes on at Fort Holland than you'd think.  I know all about you -- that you're a nice girl, competent and kind to Jessica.  The Fort needs a girl like you.  But now we've got to get you back there.  I'll walk you back and stay over night.  It'll be a nice change for me.
Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him --
Come, come, don't tell me how sorry you are that I should meet you this way.  I'm even a little glad that Wesley's difficulty brought us together.
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.
Ti-Joseph?
I'm afraid so.
I think you need some help.
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
Thank you.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
She can never be cured?
Does she suffer?
But it's so far away...
The West Indies?
That will mean another interview, won't it?
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
Yes.
No, Wes.
Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep.
But she's not dead, Wes.
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
Of course, Wes.
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
That doesn't sound like him.
I wish I hadn't heard --
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
Wait. I want to listen.
I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
But don't you have to work?
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
It's my day off.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
Mr. Holland?
Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
-- But, you're an American?
Thank you.  But who sits there?
I like her already.
Is she a doctor?
Yes -- on the boat.
I guess I'll wait until I'm home, Mrs. Rand.
You want that?
That's past -- that's over and done with...
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
You wanted to warn me...
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
She was beautiful.
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
I told you.
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
I wanted to help you.
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
I imagined this so differently...
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
You didn't drive her mad.
I love Fort Holland.
I don't know.  I wanted to help you. And now that I'm here, I don't know how.
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
I heard you playing.
You don't seem very disturbed by it.  I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened.
Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
Good morning.
I've never given it much thought.
I suppose so.  Yes.
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
I'm sorry...
Of course not!
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
I am not a frightened girl.
A figure of St. Sebastian.
Why was the maid crying?
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
Can't I take it for you?
Yes, thank you.
You can't really believe that.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
Wesley!
I'm quite sure nothing will happen, Doctor.
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
That night, I went to the Houmfort. I kept seeing Jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart. The drums seemed to be beating in my head.  The chanting -- the lights --  everything blurred together.  And then I heard a voice, speaking in a sudden silence.  My voice.  I was possessed.  I said that the woman at Fort Holland was evil and that the Houngan must maker her a Zombie.
Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort.  Tell them what you saw there.
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
The phone's out.
We'll talk in the morning.
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Ben.
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
We're not going anywhere.
Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you.
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
You're not going to --
Damn it, Ben --
Well?
That this was going to be a key party?
This just isn't the best moment for this.
In the car.
Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it?
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
If you're going to insult me --
It's a starting place.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
I'm not surprised.
Don't be dim.
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
I have no idea.
Don't start.
See for yourself.
That one.
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
Dinner in ten minutes.
The turkey in?
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
That shirt?
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to--
I... I think I am...
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
Hmm. Good night.
So early?
What do you think?
The Halfords have invited us again this year.
Good night.
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
So maybe you'll come too?
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
You're staring at me.
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
No thank you. We should be off.
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
Yeah.
Huh?
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
Talking to me, dad?
What do you think we're doing, dad?
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
Nothing.
Nah.
Good-night dad.
Fascist!
Dad stop it!
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Thank you Janey.
A key party?
Sure. Maybe coffee.
Yeah. You?
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
Well, we can talk about it.
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --
My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Let me.
It'll warm you up.
I don't like coffee.
Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
What sort of problems are you planning exactly?
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
I suppose. Why?
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.
Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
Oh Wendy.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
You're not a psycho!
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
Mom. Are you ok?
Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.
We were just riding around.
Mikey Williams?
Nobody.
Who?
With Mikey?
I saw you on your bike today.
Hi Wendy.
Hi mom.
Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
How'd you know?
I'm thinking of going back to school.
I used to know how to cook.
Thanks again. For the dinner.
Of course.
Oh.
It's not a bother.
I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile.
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
Reverend Edwards.
I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
But not too ashamed.
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
That's right.
All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
You're saying that Christ is the child, and --
Forget what?
My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?
I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
Yes, it was -- I ended up --
Yes.
Yeah.
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Yeah. Yours?
Huh?
Wow!
I don't know.
I don't know.
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
You have to follow me?
Then why'd you come after me?
Did you tell Sandy?
Sure.  Twinkie?
I have plans.
Right.
And?
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
Is this Charles?
Hood residence.
Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
With who?
Can I come?
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
Greetings, Charles.
Nixon, doofus! It's incredible. He should be shot.
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
Charles.
I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
That's nice. Are you drunk?
That's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream.
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
One more shot?
You never tasted the stuff?
Want a drink?
Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.
They left it in the jungle.
Well.  It looks like someone got to his private parts before us.
He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted.
He's dead.
No.
Yeah.
Just thought I'd stop by.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
I have to go to the bathroom.
The ones you built?
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
Yeah? See ya.
Hey Sandy.
Sure.
Good.
Didn't want to miss anything.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
Why?
I know.
Worth pursuing?
Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?
About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
Five feet?  Seven feet?
How much closer would you say you were?
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
Okay.
That must have been awful for you.
Oh, I shouldn't have...
Twelve years younger.
The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
Yeah.  All over.
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
But there wasn't any...
We already did.
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
Don't worry about him...
Actually...
Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!
Brody...I don't know...  ...Something Brody!
She used some stupid code name.
My arm!
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
It was like some big fucking secret!
She wouldn't tell me!
I don't know.
No...
That's what I said.
Hey...
Long as it's fun.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
Since grade school.
I was her best friend.
What are you doing in this shit-hole town?
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
Don't Louis --
Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
No. Laudanum.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
Is that supposed to frighten me?
Does it?
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
DID YOU DO IT TO ME????
You made us what we are, didn't you?
But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
And if I cut my hair again?
Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
Is this my birthday?
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
Why always on this night?
I'm not your daughter.
I want some more.
More.
What do you mean?
But if she dies...
And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
You really believe that?
Let him go, he said. Let him go.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
Love?
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules!
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
Be still!
Yes, and very beautiful.
And no one knows but us...
She's no vampire.
How devilishly clever.
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
But this can't be real. This is nonsense.
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
Or her, or her - or any of them?
But how will I ever know, Louis?
You don't remember? Or you never knew.
Well tell me, papa. What was it like making love?
You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
How do I look?
The ship is sailing wihout us!
It is! Take the back stairwell -
What was that?
Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I did it for you -
I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
Louis, look at me.
I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free.
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
The swamp...
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
You both did it?
You... fed on me?
And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
Why not?
You want me to be a doll forever?
Sit still. It's not finished -
Why does he call you that?
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
I want more.
What the hell would you call this?
What about a radio?
Wait...Did you say off-season?
Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
Is that bad?
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
I want off this island.
Listen to me. He's here.
Storm season?
We haven't exchanged anything.
Your what?
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Is he?
You're okay. Thank god.
Oh, god, it's you --
...Nancy?
No, you're not.
I'm holding your hand!
I'm right here. Grab my hand.
Julie?
Come on, you can make it.
I don't know...
What do we do?
There's no way to lock it.
It's too late for that.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
Then, we fight --
Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.
I've got to see.
Be careful, Julie.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
I know I don't want to stay in here.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
What do you mean?
Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
Let him go. I believe him.
Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
Julie...
They never found the body.
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
Just kidding.
Karla!
No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
Cancer in a box.
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
Nice move.
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Some.
You get any sleep at all?
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
Not me...no way...
Yes.
No.
Yes.
No way.
Okay, I won't.
Don't even think about it.
Karaoke -- perfect.
I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
I also promised Tyrell.
Karla! You promised.
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
Where is everyone? I'll ask --
Hello? Hello?
I will, and you remind me of the same thing.
Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years.
No, I'm the King of the World.
I'm the King of the World.
Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
Oh!
Then, don't.
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
He does work hard.
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
But, he said he'd try.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
I know it, and it feels good.  Hi, Ty.
Okay, okay. You're right.
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
The number's unlisted...
Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
That could break the machine.
Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway.
Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?
Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
No means yes.
No.
Say yes.
Yet. Nothing yet.
There's nothing between Will and me.
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
That was heart attack time, Karla.
i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!
What are you doing in my closet?
I thought you were out of town!
What are you doing in my closet?
I thought you were out of town!
You know me to well.
I love it here.
Never do that again.
Ray...what are you doing?
Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
Will you try...for me, please?
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.
It's okay.
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...
Ray, I can't...
Why are you being like this?
Ray, we're just friend.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Wait, it's Nancy --
I don't know.
Voodoo.
Ben Willis.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
...Why?
I trusted you.
Why are you doing this to me?
He's in it with Willis?
Did you get help?
I wasn't dreaming.
There was a body! I swear it!
It's in my room!
Are you sure? I really appreciate it.
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
It's...him.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
It beets being on the mainland.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
Deep breaths --
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
What?
I'm okay.
Right. Now I remember.
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
It was one year ago...
It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
You think that's a good place to hide?
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.
We gotta get out of here. Now.
Hey --
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?
'Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this.
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
Rio, baby!
Oooh, the mainland --
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
Honey, some folks just can't fly.
Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
Why? He can't help us.
How's Julie?
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
To a great weekend --
I said we start having fun. And that means now.
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
No. Yes?
Rio de Janeiro!
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
Yes!
Well, I'm in school and --
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
She's in her room.
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
I don't know now without my father.
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
Last night Dr. Drossos -- today you or I -- oh, no, Oliver, it can't be you, I couldn't stand it.
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
Closer and closer - until they bite into your throat!
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
Oh, no - it's too delicious! You're making it up!
I think she went to bed  I saw her going toward the house
No one can take my father's place.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Good night, Oliver.
Thank you.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache.  I'm so sorry.
M~ father will take care of it.  Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe.  I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself.
That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.
It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
What are you doing?
She has never mentioned her family.
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
We quarreled. She never dared get angry or frightened -- but I said things to her -- it was an attack, I know it was.
It was, the plague
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
She is dead  at peace.
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
I will let him go. He is dead to me as he is to all my mother's people. I turn my hand against him.
That should decide it or you --
I felt he did not like me.
I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now - I don't know 
Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.
The General  you don't even know him.
But one must love a father.
Thea, your choice is a very simple one. Either you want to claim him as your father, or you do not.
My last name is Pherides.
I have forgotten it, dear.
You have forgotten my last name?
What is it -- what are you talking about?
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -or just because he is one's father?
What an odd question!
Cathy - how does it feel to have a father?
Thea is an orphan.
You are fortunate in your father.
And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer  a correspondent of some sort 
Wouldn't I?
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people - a cataleptic!
Really, this is idiotic!
Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
No. I mean your other secret -	the one you kept bidden even from my father. That old doctor in London -- he told me.
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
Why, I'm fond of Thea.
What if he is?
What would I be thinking?
You were father's secretary - I never thought - -
How do you know what my father thought - -
Miss Wollsten!
Whet do you mean?
No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it - he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
It is for that he hates me.
It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
He hates all my race.
I can't.
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
The General threatened me.
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
Yes, but George . . .
No!
Yes, but what happened to George?
I know. I know. He didn't go.
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
Who is it?
What did you stop it for?
A boy?
Hey, who's that?
Oh, wonderful!
Why, yes. This is amazing.
Where? I don't see a thing.
Well, naturally. Of course.
Sit down? What are . . .
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission  I mean  might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir  and people are beginning to talk.
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
Splendid! Is he sick?
You sent for me, sir?
You have no idea what happened . . .
Oh, George, George!
Oh, George, George, George.
George, darling! Where have you been?
Where're you going?
Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
Where's your coat and hat?
Is it snowing?
George Bailey lassos stork.
My baby.
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
To keep from being an old maid.
Hi.
Have fun.
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
Please, let's not stop, George.
After that, who cares?
I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
George . . . George . . . George . . .
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
Don't you like her?
Thank you.
Well, then, sit down.
Would you rather leave?
Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
Do you like it?
Tuesday.
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
Didn't you tell her?
About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
Have you made up your mind?
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
I'm going to scream!
Ouch!
I'll take it. And then what?
If I told you it might not come true.
Oh, no.
What'd you wish, George?
Uh-huh.
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
You may kiss my hand.
Too young or too old?
Eighteen.
Well, why don't you say it?
Do I look as funny as you do?
Beautiful.
Neither am I.
Uh-huh.
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
A new magazine! I never saw it before.
I don't like coconuts.
I'll take chocolate.
Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't take things personally.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
Not necessarily.  These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more.  None of them are immediately fatal.  Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further.
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
And sound.
Probably.
This is a mammal, not a fish.
What makes you think there might be?
Okay, so that's it.
Carcharadon Carcharias.
Do you?
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
We don't know that, do we?
What shark?
The whale's mouth?
The what?
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
First things first.
After we've looked, we'll talk.
What is it?  What's the matter?
What're you doing?
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
I'll give notice.
What're you going to do today?
I know you did....
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
Because of today?  The beach?
That you were fired.
What?
What's wrong?
Sean's asleep.
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
Are you going to be able to sleep?
It was bad, wasn't it.
Do you?
All summer?
Terrific.
Oh.  Want to talk about it?
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
Nothing, huh?
Careful.  What's wrong?
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
It's an island.  Got to run.
One what?  Ah-ha!
Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
Where's my day book?
Eat Cheerios.
So's a donut.
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
Hey!  That's my boss!
As far as the office.
Mrs. Silvera.
Door's locked.
MMMmmmorning....
Let's get the kid home.
Fooling around?
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
Why?
My boss and your boss.  Sure.
I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
Where the hell were you?
Be careful....
Hurry, please.
I'm going.
Mike?  Our Mike?
What Kids?  Who went out?
Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
Go on, you're tired.
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
I have to walk him till the drug wears off.
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
With those camera lights and...
I can get it.
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
Are you okay?
You don't have to prove anything.
Michael, you don't have to go down there.
But you --
Michael, you're not going down there.
Who's going to do it?
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
How is he?
You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
Somebody better get down there!
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.
It's a shark's tooth!
Yes, you can.
Come on.
Michael, take deep breaths.
Honey, what is it?
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
It's too soon to move him.
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
Michael, I don't have time. Please!  It's time you dealt with this and got over it.  Now come on!
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
Yes.  It's faster.
No, we'll go through here.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
They said you'd be here.
It's my new perfume.  Great White, the Man-Eater.
Mmmm... you smell good.
Recovering nicely.
Finally.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
Sounds wonderful.
... Me, too.
No, you're not.
No.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Yes?
Thank you.
Fine piece of engineering.
What's that?
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
I know I can capture it.
Yes.
Don't think about it.  It's over.
How the hell did it get in here?
Michael...
I'm okay.
You all right?
Get your reserve bottle and let's go.
Are you coming...?
I talked you into this?
Make up your mind.
Up.
Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you.
Michael, the sub's dead.
That we swim.
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
Nothing.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
It's romantic down here.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
They just wanted to say hello.
Hi, baby.
Are you scared?
Honey... you all right?
Just put your mask on.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
Get out of here!
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
I don't like what he does.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
Okay, bye.
My imagination isn't that good.
That macho pompous English --
See you later.
Don't forget you have your brother.
I guess.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
You will.  I'll see to it.
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Well, not much longer to go.
Thank you.
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
She, Mister Hutton.
The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
How'd it get in here?!
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
Thanks to you.
Brian, he's coming around!
Get ready to go.
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
Why are you?
Thanks for helping.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Still sleeping.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
We're taking that shark alive!
What in hell is that?
You look like an orange worm.
I want that shark alive.
Like hell!
I will.
The only Great White in captivity, Calvin.  All those people standing in line...
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
No!
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
I'm sorry.
I told you, something's upset them.
I can have them walk backwards.
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
Make this quick!
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
Nobody told me.
Go where?
Not good enough.
I should have never listened to Calvin.
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
When did this happen?
And big for his age.
I know.
I think they'll come out now.
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
Hi, Mike.
Someone's looking for you.
Sure.  No problem.
Hope with none of my girl friends.
Musclehead?
'Preciate it.
Give me a ride?
SEAN!
He's diving!
It's okay, Sean.
What, hon?
Goes up.
Told you you'd like it.
Isn't this fun!
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Come on, it's fun!
Yes, it's great!
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
Besides that.
Sean, do you have herpes?
Herpes?
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
And alone.
Come on!  Check this out!
How come?
Sure am.
I'm a water-skier.
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
Well, wait till you see the rest.
You like Florida?
How long you staying?
'Course they're also so rich.
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
So, you just get here?
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
Can't help it... ahh...
Gotta sneeze.
Ahhh, ahhh...
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
I don't talk that way.
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
Hold still, damn it!
Yes, I did.
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
You're welcome.  I was the one who cried.
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
Not today.  Come on, Thea....
Come on, sweetheart....
It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....
Don't bother Hoagie....
Thea....
You'll spoil her.
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?
I don't know....
How could you do that?  Your own daughter....
She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
You knew...?
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
Thea was attacked by a shark....
Where have you been...?
Close the door.
I have work....
No....
Then don't come any closer.
I don't know...You...I don't know.
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
Because....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
Tell Matt he should be here....
We need beer....
We need milk....
We forgot to stop at the store.
It sure is good to be home....
Like mother, like son....
Chicken....
I've always wanted to ride one of those....
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
Where are you going?
He was doing his job....
He told me you both did....
You make sure they come?
We'll be there....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together.  What are you going to do now?
I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.
I always thought when I grew up I'd know what to do about things like this...I don't even know if he's serious....
Whatever happens next.....
Beginning of what?
It's beginning....
All he did was kiss me....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
At least he doesn't have a beard....
I'd be afraid of losing....
You want to try your hand at something...?
You're not interfering, Ellen....
You caught me....
Henny Youngman....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
I can't help it....
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
I like it.  Really....
It'll grow on you.
I'm not on vacation....
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
Don't be late.
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
He heard that.
I'm on the phone....
The fish.  Check it....
Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
Are you all right?
Let me finish dinner before you eat it...Chop the peppers....
I see what you're doing....
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
That....
Stop that....
I'll miss you....
I'll be in to read you a story.
Thanks for the consultation....
I almost forgot....
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
You're coming, aren't you...?
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....
Your father was six then.  Just like you....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
Thank you....
I never....
It's too dangerous....
I'd like that.  I need to be away from here.
Yes!
In a minute....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
Promise me....
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
Why'd you come out here?
You hungry?
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
I'm your mother.  It's my job....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
You and Sean used to make....
You look tired....
It's late....
Children are never satisfied.  I have my house, my friends, my job...My life, Michael.  I have to live it. Besides, I'll be back.  Now show your mother what a good dancer you are.
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....
Will you let me finish.  I've been working on this all day.
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
He's not chasing and I'm not running. And that's ridiculous....
I enjoy his company....
I am.
You're all I have left...I don't want you going in the water....
You could teach...You could....
I want you to give up your work....
Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
I'll be all right, Michael.
We haven't had a real talk, have we? We'll do that before I go.
How are you doing?
I'm fine....
You were a monkey....
I didn't mean to start that....
Oh, I didn't mean....  I'm being such a Grandma....
Oh, it looks like my uncle's.  He taught me how to sail when I was a kid....
Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
I don't want you in the water anymore....
You're damn right I'm serious....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
I want you to get out of the water....
You guys must be starving....
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
I can't....
I tried to tell you...I tried....
You sure you don't need glasses?
The whole idea is preposterous....
I'm sorry...I....
Why?
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
Won't you get in trouble...?
What?
You're always taking time off....
That's hard to imagine....
I have my own little island.
Good.  I have two left....
You'll be sorry.
No!
You're not going to bet it all....
A big one....
The kind with an umbrella in it....
You promised me a drink....
I'm terrific... Come on....
I'm fine.
Nothing....
It's wonderful....
The plane's turning....
You're impossible....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
Where do I pull off...?
What are you doing?
I don't know how....
I can't....
How can you just take the plane like this?
Doesn't matter....
When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart.  I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that.  I know it's coming....
It was no accident....
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
Flies the plane....
Can you just go off...?
You must get bored easily.
No....
I don't want them to arrest you.
I wanna be near you ...
I'm blind because my father drank.
I know about alcohol, John.
Then why didn't he kill me?
I can't identify him ..
Why does he want to kill me?
<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
I'm going back to the institute.
Why?
Why can't I stay with you?
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
No I'm not.
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
I know.
Fifty-seven .. I don't mind ..
Just your age.
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
Ross told me.
I know what you're like ..
Have you known her long?
Sorry?
You said, you were in the bad lands?
Do you pray?
No, Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry?
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
You just asked me to ask you questions.
Are you married?
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
Oh.
Are you wearing a uniform?
You should. It's wonderful.
Hamlet. Have you read it?
It was probably the wind.
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
Well, some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin, and this kind of car sounded "hollow" ..
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
Have you been here long?
I don't know.
Yes.
Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
No.
Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
My hands?
No, it has a mind of its own.
I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
Why not? You heard my voice?
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
Is that Margie?
Don't mix very well with beer.
You think John would like it?
I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
You think he still loves her?
What does that mean?
What was she like?
When did John divorce?
Oh Jerry.
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
No one has ever dumped me.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Didn't hear it.
No.
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --
I have to finish my job --
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Oh honey.  It's spun.
I just heard.
Jerry!  Do something --
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.
I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I meant something else.  When do you want to leave?
You are not a loser.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
Ugh!
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
Who told you?
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!!
Don't ever stop fucking me!
Still going.
He's asleep, right?
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
Don't let him stay up too late.
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
Come on, Jerry.  You know this isn't easy for me.  _ 118.
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
I think we made a mistake here.
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
I don't know --
I don't need you to "stick."
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
It's my fault.
Why do you love me?
Okay... I will...
And I really don't know your noises yet.
Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
Fine, I just --
Oh God.
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
Good night.
Let's not tell our sad stories.
Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
Maybe you should call her.
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
Oh good.
I'm relieved you said that.
Yeah, what happened there.
You don't have to explain.
Plus, you could use that commission.
Actually he said "glad." _ 85.
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
Good evening.
I may not sue.
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
Yeah, I did.
Don't worry about it, boss.
Well.
I'm working with you because of that memo...
What you wrote inspired me. _ 79.
Truth?
-- especially one like this.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.
Beer okay?
Sure --
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
Too bad.
Oh my God.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Hey you.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Call me later, hon.
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Well, I'm happy for you.
I just got goosebumps.
We are?
... light.
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
That took guts.
Absolutely.
No no, I know --
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
-- the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm" --
Oh tsht. Yes.
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
Oh no.
And have fun at your bachelor party.
Well, thanks.
My son... my mind...
Hmm.  Pretty good.
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
Oh, tell the story.
Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.
Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --
Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung.
Please, if I start talking --
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
No--
First you gotta tell me something.
Oh, knock it off! _ 89.
No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
Forgot your keys --
Thanks.
Good.
I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?
As opposed to twenty angry women?
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
That's the girl I love.
Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up -- _ 74.
Thank you.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
I heard.
Honey, he's engaged.  And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
At eleven at night? _ 70.
He's coming over.
He's in the living room asleep.
Wait. Where is he?
Of course I know --
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
What about medical?
What is it?
Do you think it goes all the way across?
This is how you make dinosaurs?
Eric!
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
ERRR-IIIC!
I would completely support that.
I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
We should try fishing again.
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
You couldn't have made that jump.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
Sweetheart, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.
What?...WHAT!?
Think.
When did you have it last?
He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe.  I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
Well what?
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
We have to help him.
He's this way.
Eric!
Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
No, it's...
I filmed this the morning they left.
Eric...
Just drop it Paul!
Nothing.
Nothing.
Oh, don't worry about that.
Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
So do you.
You hate to swim.
How much weight have you lost?
Nothing you haven't seen before.
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
We can't just...
What's a bad idea?
What?
From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
...once-in-a-lifetime.
We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
It is truly, whats the word? Inspiring.
You had the phone the whole time?
What about Eric?
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
Just hold on.
PAUL!
We've got to see one to find out. Is there any --
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
Not without a shot of the nest.
That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
Dad!
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
What are you guys gonna do?
On the side of that one truck.
"InGen."  What's InGen?
Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.
You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you?
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
I could come with you.
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
That was about a year ago.
Which one?
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
My vacation is over in a week.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
I don't even know this woman.
Hi, Dad.
You're going too?
What?
Oh, God.
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
These formations.  They're dried --
Ian.  It's guano.
Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals.  The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square.
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
What?!
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes!  There we are -- your baby is free --
Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
Funded by whom?
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
Where's Ian?
WHAT ARE YOU-
No.
Hold it down, Nick!
We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
-- way we could safely --
I believe in him.
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
You think this is all a joke?
Very noble of you.  You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
So what's your story, Nick?
You've got to be kidding.
Ask her.
We have to send someone to look for him!
Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
How long will this take?
How would we cut off the lysine?
But would we get the phones back?
Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
Two million - - great.  That would help.  Oh good, that'll take no time.
How many lines of code are there?
What one?
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
Are you sure?
That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
These are dilated.  Take a look.
Six weeks?
Okay, I'm following the tubing.  I'm going down a passage way.  How long does this stuff go for?  Could you guys talk a little bit to me?
Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.
Look.
Why?
John....
Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion.
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
Carousel.
Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.
Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
I have samples all over the kitchen.
Did I say jerk?
I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
You can't hold it by yourself!
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.
And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.
- - barfs them up - -
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
Yeah, I know.
Constantly sick.
I know.
It's my favorite.
Oh, shit.
Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
So what are you thinking?
We were right!
You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
The - - agility.  You're right!
Why would they care what we think?
Small versions of adults, honey.
Sattler.
Okay, who's the jerk?
It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now!
Anything else, you old fossil?
The what?
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
They died together?
Like hell it is!
Why not?
I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
Oh my God.  Aw, God.
Okay, I'm on channel two.
We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
Okay.
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
What's that?
Alan?!
Do you see anything?
Alan!
The other car!
No, no, no!
The fences are electrified, right?
- - shut up.
Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
Faster, faster!
Can we chance moving him?
Yeah.
Alan?
Alan?
Unpredictability....
Oh, imperfections?
Alan, listen to this.
Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
I'm still not clear on Chaos.
Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
Anti-nature.
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
And scary.
I get ah - -
No.
Phone security systems, everything works.  You ask for it, we got it!
Yes.
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
Timmy!  Do as he says!  Timmy!  Do as Dr. Grant says, quick!
Do as he says!  The power's coming back, Timmy!
Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!
Let's go!
Please!
What's that?
I like cows.
Go away!
All night?
What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
What are you gonna do now if you don't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more?
Dorkatops!
Oh, I hate the other kind.
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
Alright.
It's safe.
It's safe?
Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
He left us!  He left us!
Dad - - Dad - -
He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!  Daddy, daddy!
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!
Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!
That's not funny.
What?
I'm a hacker!
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  Stop! Stop!  Don't let the monsters come over here!
They don't bother me.
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
I don't know!  I'm sorry!
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!
We love the presents.
We miss you.
You're detestable.
You're just doing your job.
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
I do.  Always.  You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka.  And what it's becoming.  I've always held you in the highest regard.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.
Why should I believe a man who never believed me?  They're absolutely right, you know -- guilt should never be doubted. It's easier that way.
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
It's still easier for you to understand suicide, isn't it.
You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
I wouldn't put it past him.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
They're not obliged to tell.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.
Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
He was murdered.
He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant.
The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?
You strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men.  And yet you're able to remain an outsider.  With the concomitant air of ... superiority?
I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.
They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
You won't have any trouble finding it.
I'm suspicious of men who want to marry.  I believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.
Eduard wanted to marry me.
You almost married recently, didn't you?
There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
Are you free tonight?
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.
As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.
What's funny?
It's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office.
What?
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
Yes.
Have you looked?
Hello again.
Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.
One of you must be mistaken.
Why would you suppose so?
I know.
Get the hell out of here.''!
Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
It's ... lovely.
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ... · organize an expedition -
Father ... Father!
Father!
I photographed it extensively, father.
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
You're the animals - all of you!
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
Jack!...  Jack!
No! Don't!
Give it back!
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Jack!
It's the same image - Kong!
There's a light up ahead.
I can't imagine you crying.
I want to thank you.
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
Can you fly?
I not doing this for me, Jack! It's for my father. This is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years! It belongs to him! I'm going to that island ... nothing's going to stop me!
Where do I charter a boat?
No!
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
Tell me, Mr Driscoll - is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down?
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
He's grubbing for money, father.
Did he come around often?
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a Dumper --
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
She was with you after she left Frank.
Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page.
Uh uh.
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
And nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but I felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling --
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
-- May I? It's so --
And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
I said that.  Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or --  So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it.  And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.  And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
Do you always have to repeat?
All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
I do not love him.
Guess!
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
Look -- could I use your phone?
No.
Grunemann? I've looked at him a --
Oh no.
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
What was better? I made better bait?
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
Why isn't he locked up?
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
So do I.
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
I said yes, I see.
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
Will you let me go then?
Yes.
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
-- Yes.
Yes -- all right --
Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me?
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
What?
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
You could at least look at me!
You wanted to, or you are?
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
You're going back?
Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
How do you know how bad it was?
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
With Trina.
Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints.  Can I go in? I need some stuff.
Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?
You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right?
Right back at the start, right?
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
Oh look what he did in them.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life.
You and I -- a relationship.
Spangler says we have a relationship.
Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more.  I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore.
Is that all you have to say?
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
No, not just 'mm'. You don't know what I --
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
Please.
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
No.
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
I don't get you.
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
Why?
Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
How?
-- Then you don't need me.
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
Arlyn Page.
When?
Well what're you down about? You mean because you didn't get me there?  You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John.
What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
So you're not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or Tommy-baby --
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Oh, don't be a doo-doo.
It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
Goodbye.
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
You said it was!
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
What're you gonna do next?
Is there anything more I could --
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
Well -- she's dead.
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.
He never told me.
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
Can't you get him?
Well do you think it was him?
You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.
I go on rounds.
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
What? This?
Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.
Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
-- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things --
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
How would I remember?
Most of them.
Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--
I can't say he was anybody!
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
You remind me of my uncle.
All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville --
Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all.
Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
Honest?
Why?
Gee.
Who?
You said that.
What about?
What is it?
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
Yes.  Very much.
I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
No, I did not.
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
Six years.
Yes.
I consider it less my failure than his.
I was not a failure.
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
Yes.
I suppose...
I...I don't know...
Somewhere in between.
I don't recall.
I don't recall.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Yes.
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?
Only can I still see him?
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
Please...Please don't stop me. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do..
Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
Ted, do you love him?
Ted, do you love him?
Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--
I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing.  I never thought he'd use it.
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
He looks like a terrific kid.
A few times.  Sometimes I sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school.
I've seen him.
You can't tell it from a distance, Ted.
Yes...How's Billy?
How's the new job?
Hello, Ted.  You look well.
I don't know...
NO!...Please...Please don't make me stay...I swear...If you do, sooner or later...maybe tomorrow, maybe next week...maybe a year from now...  I'll go right out the window.
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
I'm not taking him with me.
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me.  It's my fault--you just married the wrong person.
I've paid the rent, the Con-Ed and the phone bill, so you don't have to worry about them.
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
Ted, I'm leaving you.
It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
I'm going to take it.
I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.
Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
Kramer--
Right.
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
Murray.
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
You want to know why?  I'll tell you why...  Another scotch and soda for the gentleman.  I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore.  Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
Kramer...
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
Yes, I'll have dinner with you.
Yes.
Sure.
It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
Ted, I just heard...
Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
Ted.
You heard anything yet?
Me?!  You want me to take care of Billy?!
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
What?
Sure.
I told her you're doing a
Uh, huh...Yeah...
Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
No.  I don't think so.
Three.  And add some basil.
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
You're sure?
You're on your own, understand?
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?
All right...Okay...But let's get something straight, right now. I mean, I'm sorry about what happened between you and Joanna, but it's not my problem, understand?
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
What are you going to do?
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
No.
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
Ted, don't be so hostile.
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
Look, Ted, all I--
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix it.
You're gonna be okay.
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
And how would we neutralize him?
They could try to tranq him on land.
What?
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
No.
Oh, bullshit.
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
Excuse me?
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
<u>Jack</u>!
Scales were oval.  It was an <u>Asian</u> crocodile.
He was an Indo-pacific.
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
I'm just saying last resort.
You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
<u>Hector</u>.
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
I never had sex with you!
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
Good thinking.
Probably not.
You think?
No.
Different worlds, Jack.
Likewise.
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
Yeah.
No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.
Well...
He heeds a tourniquet.
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
We gotta get to Hector!!
Hector!!
Watch out!!
He's mooing.
He's floating.  Take it home.
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
Well...
Good idea.
Okay.
Alright, Jack!
What?
You calm down!
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
<u>I'm</u> <u>not</u> <u>mushing</u> <u>it</u>.
I'm not mushing it.
Thing we can lift it?
What?
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
Night.
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
It's okay.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
You <u>did</u>, you--
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
What are you talking about?
Excuse me?
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
That's probably good.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
Good luck.
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
Good.
That was an awful thing to say to me.
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
I beg your pardon?
Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
I'd be able to see something.
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook mythology professor.  He's done some work with our museum.  He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
Oh my God.
I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
I'm not making it up.
So I don't like tents, why--
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
I <u>told</u> you.
I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene.  I never <u>believed</u> it.
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
How big do the bears get?
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
Are we all museum bigots in Maine?
Kelly Scott.
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
Wait.
Did you get him?
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
Look ten feet into the water.
What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Hank!
Are you okay?
Hank?
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
What was that?
<u>That</u> was a bust.
Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah.
What is this?
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
I asked you to be nice to him.
I'm sorry.
It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker.
Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
You threw it at me!!
It looks like a branch.
What?
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
Gee.
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
Sheriff.
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
It's just that--
And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
Ever even been <u>in</u> one?
You have a thing against museums?
What?
What kind of backup do we have?
You talk to the married couple?
Okay.  And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit?
And this is how he came to the boat?
This... how long did this attack go on for?
I can look at dead things.
Well.  At wakes.
I'm fine, thank you.
Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
Is the dead guy in there?
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
Did he say anything?
<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--
I'm not even a field person.
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
Are you on drugs?
This is what we do?
Sorry?
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
A tooth?
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
Yes, well...  famished.
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know...
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
That's not what you came to say.
Me too.
Absolutely.
Kevin, hey.
I really... I should get back.
Myra.
No.
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
You and Kevin.
<u>You</u>?
<u>You</u>?
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
He knew her...!
"- every day."
But why? He didn't weight the others.
Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
What girl?
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
"Desperately random." What does he mean?
He's here, Ardelia.
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
No. He won't come after me.
Somebody's coaching her... They're trying to make him see Catherine as a person - not just an object.
Boy, is that smart...
Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
Thanks, Ardelia.
What'd I do?
Never cock. Just squeeze.
I will... I promise.
Sometimes.
I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
Where?
Shut UP!  The other officers will be here any minute! you're perfectly safe now!
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up.  Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
You're all right! Where is he?
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company.
Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
I understand.
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
Not yet! - just wait for me.  Maybe in about two seconds.
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
That wasn't me.
Okay, Mr. Yow...
Good idea.
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
Did she leave any records here? Tax or business records? Maybe a list of employees?
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
I think we may be, yes.
Thanks.
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
Yes sir. Thank you, sir...
Yes sir... I'll do my best.
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
Sewing...
Sir, that's great news. But how -
Where?
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
He's making himself a "woman suit," Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -
He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it...
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
You do until six p.m.
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home.
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
But if he knew we have so little time -
He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...
He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
Murdered...? How?
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
And what is that, sir?
Yes sir.
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
Who's the subject?
Not yet.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
Dr. Lecter...
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
Not lately. But maybe someday.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Sometimes you do.
I think so.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
Did you ever work with her?
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
You know I can't make that promise.
Dr. Lecter -
Starling.
Yes. I'll tell you.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Yes...
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...
I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
Yes...! They were screaming.
Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
I heard a strange sound...
Early. Still dark.
And - one morning I just - ran away...
Later, listen, I'll -
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
All right, then tell me how -
No. We just -
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
He kills w-
Then tell me how.
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
Nobody sent me. I came on my own.
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
Yes, Doctor. Please.
How would he test?
On what basis would they reject him?
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
No.
I - ran away...
Two months.
Horses - and sheep...
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
No. Tell me why.
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.
The death of my father.
Go, Doctor.
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
A moth... How did you predict that?
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
They all were.
Yes.
By the book, he's a sadist.
I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
Who killed your patient?
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
I don't know. Is it?
That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
I never thought about it.
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
Because you weren't wasting my time.
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
Why? Do you know something about him?
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
Then please - do this test for me.
And the questionnaire...?
Reasonably so. Yes.
You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth.  Or maybe you're afraid to.
No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
No. You ate yours.
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
Five... so far.
No, I came because we need -
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -
All that detail, just from memory...?
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
Maybe they'll catch up.
Yes.
He said - "I can smell your cunt."
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
I am, yes.
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
Where will we go?
I have nothing to go back for.
Alice?
...never doubt what you are doing.
Yes. I want you to go.
Our father? Did you see my father?
Are we safe?
What is it?
No. I will find you.
What would you have me do?
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
Mr Poe?
Much further?
On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring...  to my blood...  ...than any imagining could possibly have been...
You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
How did you learn English?
I'm sorry.
Thank you so much.
"We're a breed apart and we make no sense"...?
Why did they turn back?
What?!
He did?
Your "father"?
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
You knew them.
Why didn't you bury those people?
I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference.
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
There was no letter.
There was none!
When? How?
What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
Yes. Go ahead.
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
I am sorry, Duncan...
Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
He delivered no such message.
My God, Alice.
Yes. Yes, I will.
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
Some say that's the way of it.
Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
You still have an aversion to the water?
I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
It hit me!  Where are they?!
We made it!
Can't we fix it?
How much time does that give us?
Seeing how my stock's doing...
Maybe they already have.
They know, don't they?
The escape bubbles?
What can we do?
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
Has it helped?
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Good...It's going good.
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
Sixpack?
You screw around like that again and--
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
Still...you did the right thing.
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
You did good...
Timex...
You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
I signed-up for the stock option.
How's TransOcean doing?
Made your million, yet?
I'm not touching you!
It saw us!
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Are you okay, Jonesy?
Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
Are you sure you saw something?
Don't spend all day down there.
The shack...
What is it?
What is it?
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
It needs blood?
What's wrong?
What on earth's the matter with you?
How is he?
Who were you talking to?
No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...
What is it?
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Clear for pickup.
Hardly.
Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
Right.
Your pocket?
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, I would be happy! I would be thrilled.
That isn't true.
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
How do you think you're going to make a living?
Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me.
That makes it okay?
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
--you're going to be on your own.
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
Leave your sister out of it.
Oh, come on, Amado--
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
No, sir. Not at all.
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
I do, sir.
I mean, follow orders, sir.
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
You really want to know, sir?
The--the officers.
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
I am, sir.
I-I can do the job, sir.
Yes, sir--
I'm sorry, sir.
No, sir--
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
Will this go on my record?
Out of the Army?
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
Yes, Sergeant.
You're testing me?
I'm feeling okay--
Sergeant?
I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
We were just dancing--
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
350 pounds.
No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
Do I seem jumpy?
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
Oh. Right. And you're in--?
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
Don't worry about it. He owes me some favors.
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
Tipico.
This girl has a child?
I thought you were married!
This girl is a friend of yours?
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
You have somebody else out there?
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?
Quien es? [Who is it?]
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
The Sheriff.
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
Steve?
"That boy"--Mami, say his name for chrissakes!
I never said that. It was just that boy--
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
I never said that.
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
I don't mean Fernando.
Thank you.
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
Nobody's too busy.
I was too busy.
There must have been somebody.
How come you never got married again?
A little older than Paloma is now.
Right. When he was killed.
He was killed.
Mami, how old were you when my father--
You want to see Mexicans, open your eyes and look around you. We're up to our ears in them.
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
Why would I want to go there?
No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
If you spent a little more time training them--
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
Well, you hire illegals--
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
Not if I can help it.
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
You ever play one of these?
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
That's me.
I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt--
I don't think you can take it personally--
He's going to wish he was dead.
Okay? He's not here?
Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
I only went for my last two years.
Enough with the clothes--
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
It's Saturday.
What do you think?
For a while.
Yeah?
It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
Of course you can.
Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
We start from scratch--
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
Couple months before I was born--
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.
Yeah?
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
Like your story is over.
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
How long have you lived here?
So what are we gonna do about this?
How come it feels the same?
Wow.
Yeah?
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
I mean what did we know about anything?
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
We thought we were something, didn't we?
Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam.
I should get back.
They've got me. Different thing.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
You don't want to be Sheriff.
So why did you come back here, Sam?
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
He hates me.
Amado.
Weird what you remember.
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--
People liked him.
I thought you got through that pretty well.
So she tells me three times a week.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
Are you okay?
We haven't talked since high school.
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
They've got my Amado.
What is he?
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
Why did you wait so long?
Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?
Harry-?
Is it finished?
Harry?
Don't look.
Yes.
I'm here, Harry.
Harry...
You can't.
Oh God!
Harry?
Are you all right?
What was that?
And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was ready for them.
Yes.
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
I know.  I'm the one who shot him.
Are you sure?
I was so afraid.
Nothing?
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
I wasn't.
No.
I told you --
Some or it.
He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
It was more than that, I think.
Oh Christ.
What did you find?
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
Yes.  You do that.
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
That's my business. Harry.
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
They were jealous of him.
How did it go today?
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
They won't tell you anything.
I don't know where you'd start.
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
You haven't seen anything yet.
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
Harry.
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
You don't believe me.
We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
He's a secretive man.
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
I think we make our own futures.
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
What about me?
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
No word from D'Amour?
You saw this?
Valentin?
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
Oh God.
Sure.
... they believe you.
Bad show last night?
I'll miss you.
Ok, bye.
Well... have a good flight.
You're leaving right now?
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
Hi, Bob.
I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
Well, I mean it more now.
I'm going to miss you.
When are you leaving?
That lunch was the worst, huh.
Around.
A coke.
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
No.
Yeah.
Working.
You think so?
It's bad isn't it?
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
Fuck off.
Oh, she'll love it.
How old is she?
You made it.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
I know, but that's what you like about me.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
No one ever tells you that...
That's too scary.
Oh.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
And marriage, does that get easier?
But, I'm mean.
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
Yeah? But look at you.
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
I know.
Oh.
Oh, for her show?
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
I don't remember.
Did I scowl at you?
Really?
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
OK, see you downstairs.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
It's Charlotte.
I don't want to go home.
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie Brown.
No.
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
See you later.
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
Not really. How long are you here for?
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
Oh, hi.
Hi again, how's it going?
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
Philosophy.
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
Oh.
25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
Two years.
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
What are you doing here?
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
When are you coming home?
I guess she's busy.
Zoe, come say hello to your father...
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
Do you want to-
Fine. Is it going ok?
It's Lydia, your wife.
Hello, Bob, it's me.
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
Fine.
Alright?
What?
Is there anything I can do?
What are you talking about?
It's just carpet.
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
Is this a bad time?
Bob?
Good-night.
Ok, well... I love you.
Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
That sounds great  can you hold on...  What Zoe?
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
Hello, darling.
I miss you.
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
Are you sure you have to go?
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
Ok, I will... later.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
Do you think it's done?
Yeah.
Bye.
Hair stuff?
Like popcorn?
You smell weird.
I don't know what to do.
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
Sure.
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
How'd it go today?
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
Why do you have to defend her?
Evelyn Waugh was a man.
Evelyn Waugh?
Ok, bye.
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
Sure.
It's cool... but,I don't know... I went to a shrine today and all these little monk's were chanting... and, I didn't feel anything... I even tried ikebana, ...   and John's using hair products... I don't know who I.
Lauren?
We're still going to be together.
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
She's been stalking you, Peter.
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
Must be a spare set.
I don't know.  What are they?
This is the person...you were talking about?
There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
Thank God he did.
I'm still shaking.
When did they find her?
What?  That's horrible!
I spaced out.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Peter, where are you?
You know, there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we're losing daylight.  Quarks and dark matter, things like that.  Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you know?
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
Sushi.
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Bad?
You never said anything to me...
It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
I missed you.
Eight.  That okay?
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
...you wearing a watch, Father?
Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
Peter, are you okay?
You heard voices, you know you did.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
What did you hear?
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
You'll do it?
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
I hope so.
He will.  He has great faith.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
Father, please don't die.
So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
So...we won?
What do you mean "don't worry?"
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
Father, I'm right here.
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
Why are you doing this to me?
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
I didn't know what else to do...
Peter...Peter Kelson.
Well I know he's come here before.
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.
Oh, Peter.
Not a lot.
Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  "But this shall you deal with them.  You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."
He was trying to tell me something.
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
What are these?
Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
Maybe that's my problem.
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.
You have to say that.
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
Comfort.
There's nothing else here.
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
Your 33rd birthday.  The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead.  Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
When's your birthday?
Peter, let go of the chair!
Get up!!
Nothing yet.
We needed to know all we could.
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
I don't know.  I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way.  I don't know if it works the same way in this instance.  I don't even know when it's going to happen.
Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry.
Then why are you here?
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
Do you know your parents' blood types?
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
Please, the children.
Peter, please...
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
I had to.
You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
You're sure?  There was nothing?
What do you mean?
So...what did you think of the tape.
Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist?
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
And also that...
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
Peter Kelson?
Oh my God!
Look, John, I'm facing it.
You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
We need all the help we can get.
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
I know who he is.
Good seeing you again.
When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.
What are you talking about?
It mattered, Mom.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
That's ridiculous.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
I don't remember that.
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
That's not it.
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
No I don't.
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
There you go.
Don't curse.
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
Whatever.
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
So what do I do?
Maybe she is.
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
Yeah, you met her?
To that stewardess?
Engaged.
How is he?
Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
I can manage.
Need any help?
Hi.
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
What?
He's still at the bank.
Dad around?
Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Monica.  What are you doing here?
Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that?
What?
Nothing.  So good luck.
What?
Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
Child, take a bite.
I can't eat before a game.
Taste this.
Watch your mouth.
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
That's not funny
I won't.  I'm a lesbian.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
nothing.
Pants.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
I hate it.
I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
Ah, Mom.
Oh, all that work.
Nothing.
Monica, what did you do?
Okay.
The blue.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
Okay.
He's fine.
You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
So you're still breast-feeding?
What'd you do?
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
But you use potato?
...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
I just need to lay down.  I've been running around all day.
Are you okay?
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
Really?  Well, come on, then.
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do.  Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about.
You're a caterer?
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
Okay?
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
Thanks.
Coach...
What?
I can take it.
Wait...
Uh-huh.
My mouth is kinda dry.
Sorry.
Huh?
Sort of.
Oh, sorry.
You're cold?
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
They ever love you back?
Too many times.
You ever been in love?
Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
I don't know how to walk in heels.
If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
Yeah, right.
You do.
Oh, great.
I told him you looked like me.
How'd you get him to say yes?
And he's fine, girl.
He's in college?
This brother from my college.
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
No.
Mom tell you to do this?
I know...
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
I found you someone.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
Just try and chill a little bit, alright.
No one's forcing her.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
Like you don't give her a hard time.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Mom's going to hate it.
No.
That too tight?
You shoot like a girl.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
Dad.  What are you doing here?
Chances are there's still a chance.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
What?
I was just showing emotion.
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this.
You ever think about going back?
Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women.  They can't get enough of me.
Just not my type, I guess.
What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
I wouldn't know.
So what are these Spanish guys like?
It's better.  Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad "The American" was making more money.  I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball.
How's that been?
Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
Just like that?
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
What's up, Sidra.
Well, what do you know.
Never let a freshman take your spot.
What's that?
Just one word of advice for next season.
I know.
But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
Thanks.
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
But?
Just wanted to say good game.
What's up?
Didn't have to try very hard.
You were trying to make me look bad.
I was just playing ball.
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
Thanks, Sidra.
Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
What's up with that?
She hates all freshmen.
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
So you're gonna bitch up?
Your heart.
One game.  One-on-one.
I'll play you.
Better late than never, right?
Then why are you so upset?
I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
From basketball.
You asked me what was missing.
We need to talk.
It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.
Something was just missing.
Why do you keep asking me that?
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
Wow.
Like what?
You're serious.
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
It just isn't.
That's okay.  I'm probably, you know, busy.
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
So...how's the knee?
Who's this guy I always see her around?
You visiting?
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
Actually, I don't...
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
Oh yeah?
Kiss my ass.
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
We won the championship.
I forgot, "Q-man."
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
What are the doctors saying?
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
Uh huh.
So that's it, just forget about us?
When did you decide all this?
You're what?
You don't think so?
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
What?
How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
I never asked you to choose.
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
So you fucked around to prove a point!
Cheap date.
Talk to your new girlfriend.
Are you out of your mind?
What the hell's going on?
Woman...
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
You weren't at my game.
Hey.
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
You want to go talk?
Who's nobody?
Who was that?
he's just playing, Q...
Sorry about your game.
I've been trying to find you all day.
Hey.
Quincy...
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up.
I...can't.
Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
You're not stupid.
She understands.
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
I won.
Yo, where's the "D"?
Kiss my booty.
Give me the ball.
What?
What are we playing for?
That was so weak.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
Quit.
I said fine.
Fine, Quincy.
You do see me standing here, right?
Whatever, big head.
What'd it say?
You finish the reading for E-con?
I know, right?
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
What?
Why?
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
Mulholland Drive.
Early night for you, isn't it?
So you took Shawnee, huh?
He ain't Spalding.
Yeah.
Hey.
You either.
Yeah.
Good.
Didn't know you cared so much.
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
Would you watch the damn road?
When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose.
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
Who's Spalding?
I don't.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
Please.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
A ride home.
Way to hoop.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
You're stupid.  And your Daddy plays for the worst team in the NBA.
I don't have to do what you say.
So?
I want to ride my own bike.
For how long?
Okay.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
I don't like flowers.
What do I have to do?
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
I don't care.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
He works at a bank.
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
I just can.
Uh huh.
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
One, up.
Give it yourself.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
No.
Hey.
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
He tore his ACL.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
Not great.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
At one in the morning?
You just got back from a four game road trip.
With who?
We should head over.
Zeke.
Guess I should have been telling your father.
Quincy, please...
Just...leave it alone.
Whose truth are you talking about?
Guess he talked to you.
I'm fine.
You scared me.
Later when?
Where's your dad?
Still the man.
How was your game?
You hearing me?
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
What is this?
Yeah.
What?
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
GET OUT.
YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
I'M NOT YOUR BABY, I'M NOT YOUR GIRL. I'm not your fuckin' baby --
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
GET THE FUCK OUT.
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
I don't wanna talk to you.
Don't sit down.
What the fuck do you want?
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
He's not my boyfriend.
What do you want? Why are you here?
...what the fuck is this...?
just let me walk out, ok?
Let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
Just say no.
....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
I've got troubles.
You don't know how crazy I am.
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
That was so great what you just said.
Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
What?
You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
Can I tell you something?
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
ok.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
I'm sorry --
What?
Ok.  I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
You wanna make a deal with me?
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
Why not?
So you've done it --
Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
Great, bye.
It's my favorite place --
Billingsley's?
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
Eight o'clock?
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
I thought you were flirting with me a little.
Really?
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
Well...is that illegal?
You wanna go on a date with me?
What is it?  Did you forget something?
Good bye.
yeah, good, ok.
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
I'm sorry.
If you're not here for a 422 --
We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don't even know if I have TMJ exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched --
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
Thank you.
Ok, ok. I'm back.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.
You won't.  You won't have to.
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
It's not -- what's a 422?
-- is not my boyfriend.
I don't have a boyfriend.
Yeah.
You take cream or sugar?
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
-- do you wanna cup?
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
I don't have a boyfriend.
Yeah.
Yeah.
About two years ago.
ok.
What are you lookin' for?
It's fine.
I was...he's gone...I mean it's not. It's over, y'know --
No.
No.
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
No.
Yeah.
I didn't realize it was that loud.
No.
Yeah, but I don't know --
What?
Wilson.
I'm sorry.
For what?
Yes.
I'm sorry, I had to get dressed.
I'm coming!
uh...uh...What is it?
...Hello...?
-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
I need to sit down.
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
Yeah.
He has Phil right now.
I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?
-- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
So you sat it out, that's what you did?
Yeah.
C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?
I talked to Miss Simms.  Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
She lived in Tarzana.
She does.  From when you were a boy.
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
It's all important --
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
Are you asking me that?
This isn't meant --
I would just want to clear some things up:
-- just to clarify --
I'm confused about your past is the thing.
-- let's talk more about your background --
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
Let's talk about --
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
Ok.  So, lemme just ask you a couple questions to start --
I'm gonna start rolling --
All it takes is one second?
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
Kind of.
They wouldn't?
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
And "Frank?"
It's not your given name, right?
Where does that name come from?
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
In five years?
Do you have your masters?
Psychology major?
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
I wouldn'tve asked --
I'm sorry.
And your father?
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
Are you close?
Does you mother still work?
Why does that sound silly?
And what did your parents do?
the valley?
Where are you from originally?
THAT'S NOT MINE.
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
I didn't hear anything.
It's ten o'clock in the morning --
No.
No.
Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
I went out last night.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
I don't know a loud crash.
I didn't do anything.
I preffer to stand.
Marcie.
No I Said.
I live alone.
No.  I said that.
You're here.
What does it look like?
I don't have to answer your questions.
I AM CALM.
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
There's no disturbance.
There's no disturbance.
I am calm.
You're just come in --
You can't just come in here.
What? What? What now?
You should know better.
No.
Yes you do.
You deserve to die alone for what you've done.
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
But you can't say....
...Jimmy...
Jimmy, did you touch her?
Did you ever touch her?
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
...say it, Jimmy...
I think that you know.
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
I'm not through asking my questions.
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
Well maybe.
Do you have any children with anyone?
Is it over 'cause you're sick?
What about now?
How long with Paula?
How long with Ellen?
No one else that I know?
hey.
Who?
Was there anyone that I know?
I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...
Yeah.
The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
...No...I don't hate you.  Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
No.  No.
You're my handsome man.
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
It'll take the pain away.
Bye.
I love you.
Did you tell her?
-- did she talk to you?
Come home soon after the show.
Slowly or quickly?
How you doing?
Shut the fuck up.
I have to go.
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
What does that mean?
Where will the money go?
I can't.
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl.  When I started, when I met him, I met him and I fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you understand?  I'm telling you this now...this I've never told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments...  I took care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then?
-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
Tell him I'm sorry, ok, yes, you do that, now, I'm sorry, tell him, for all the things I've done...I fucked up and I'm sorry.... And I'm Gonna Turn Away And Walk Now And Not Look At Him Not See My Man, My Earl, I'll leave now...and tell him it's ok and I'm ok. The whole thing was ok with me -- and I know.
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...
BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT HE DIDN'T ASK YOU, HE DOESN'T WANT HIM, HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO HIM, SO FUCK YOU THAT HE ASKED THAT. THERE IS NO ONE BUT ME AND HIM.
You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?
PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
Hang up the phone.
What are you doing?
I COME IN HERE - YOU DON'T KNOW, YOU DON'T KNOW WHO THE FUCK I AM OR WHAT MY LIFE IS AND YOU HAVE THE FUCKING BALLS, THE <u>INDECENCY</u> TO ASK ME A QUESTION ABOUT MY LIFE --
You motherfucker...you motherfucker.... YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
...I don't....
mmmhmm.
Hi.
Neither did I.  I'll make it up to you, I promise...
Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
Yeah.
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
I had it all on tape...
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
Yeah...they did.  One girl...
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
No.  A witness.
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
You'll find out - soon enough.
No.
You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
Mind if I turn out the light?
You're the mysterious type, right?
You got any family?
Where up north?
So where are you from?
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
You wouldn't like it, either if you had it.
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
The Tooth...
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
Francis...?
Who?
Who is it?
You'll come by?
Are you okay...?
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
Francis? Where are you?
I'm fine, Francis.
I'll get my purse.
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
I'm fine.
Is that you. D?
That was nice of you to think of that.
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
I'll probably go back to it someday.
You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
In the kitchen.
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
Let me stick this in the black hole.
When do you need it?
What's being photographed?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
Let's forget who said what to whom...
Maybe we should give it some time...
That's not true.
Will?  You could come up here.
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
I want to see you, too.
Will? Are you okay?
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
Will...
William: you are going to make yourself sick or get yourself killed.
Is Crawford going with you?
What will you do?
And... where are things?
Can you quit?
Then why?
Have you ever omitted telling me. things before?
I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
Do you remember what you said?
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay...  He's after you now, isn't he?
I love you...
Blue is cold.
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
To do what?
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
Me, too. And very erotic...
At the store. You doin' some good?
Hello, hotshot!
Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night.
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
He asked how you are.
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
You're NOT DYING!
How can you be so casual??!
Have you told your family?
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
Andy... there is no real you.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
It's me.
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
And all this will be for real?
Why Memphis?
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
I'm here, ain't I?
You were impressed with something. It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television.
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Andy, the theater's that way!
No thanks.
Hi... am I late?
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Andy, the theater's that way!
No thanks.
Hi... am I late?
Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
... yes.
Goddamn you, Cypher!
But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.
The Matrix isn't real!
My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
You killed them.
An accident?!
Cypher?  Where's Tank?
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
Are you sure this line is clean?
Did you hear that?
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
Morpheus believes he is the One.
Don't be ridiculous.
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
You can't use that until Neo is out!
How long?
What is he doing?
They'll be able to track it.
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
I got a fibrillation!
All right --
Goddamnit!
Are they any agent?
You're going to have to make a final choice.  In one hand, you will have Morpheus' life.  In the other hand, you will have your own.  One of you is going to die.  Which one, will be up to you.
Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
What's funny?
Your next life, maybe.  Who knows. That's how these things go.
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say --
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
Not too bright though.
You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
That vase.
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
Not yet.
Are you all right?
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
Neo, how did you do that?
No one has ever done anything like this.
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
I'm coming with you.
What?
Because...
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
No, you... have to be.
What?
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
You can't!
What are you doing?
What choice?
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
What happened?
Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
We have to!
Go!
A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
What happened?  What did you see?
What did you just say?
Are you all right?
She told me...
Yes.
No.
Are you worried?
That's different.
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
What?
It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
Easy, Neo.  Easy.
It's going into replication.
We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
And I know that's not where you want to be.
Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.
Neo, please, you have to trust me.
From you.
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
When I asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question.  They have to see it to believe it.
It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
They're watching you, Neo.
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
Most guys do.
What?
That was a long time ago.
My name is Trinity.
I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
Hello, Neo.
Hurry, Neo.
What just happened?
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
Neo!
Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
Dozer?
Tank, you're hurt.
Got it.
Cypher, I thought --
We need an exit!
He's alive.
Tank, it's me.
For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
But...
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
The green capsules in the top drawer.
I'm sleepy.
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
You know why...with my parents.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
You're intolerable today.
Sure...He lives there?
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
A paper on that one too?
Ok.
C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
It's still sick.
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
No.
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
What is it now?
Anything specific?
Charlie...?
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
It's all right.
I don't mind.
Please take it.
Here.
Do you have enough?
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
Dinner?  Again?
Yeah, speak for yourself.
Look who's talking.
You think so?
-- But he does seem very nice.
...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's like he dropped from the clouds...
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
That's your name?
...I'm here, aren't I?  Wouldn't miss a loose end meeting.  What's on the table for discussion?  Party favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --
You ate?
Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
He's cute.
Love that name.
Daddy!  Come on, a name.
His wife?
Did you speak to the Governor?
Yes, it is.
But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
That you've been to Susan?
They respect you.  Isn't that a kind of love?
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
-- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room.  I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
'Goddam party'!
It's for the party, Dad --
From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
Annie made them.
That's okay, Daddy.
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
From the Korean War.
Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?
Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
And you could care less --
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
No.
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
But it's your birthday.
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
Have you got a minute?
Daddy!
What will I tell Annie?
Yeah, but --
Honey --!
Paillarde of veal.
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
What about the Mayor?
Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's.  You too, Drew.  We've still got some loose ends --
Honey, please.
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
Well... goodnight.
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
Drew, you're out of line.
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
...See you tomorrow night.
What 'business'?
Hi.
You think so?
That's it?
-- Yes?
Hold me --
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --
You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
Yes, that's why I said it.
It's a saying.
'Love will find out the way'.
Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
Don't.  That will come later.
We know all that we need to know --
Then don't.
It gets worse.
And you can't tell me who you are.
Where are you going?
It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
I like you in a black tie.
For how long?
Where are you going?
More than you love peanut butter?
Did you like making love to me?
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
You're here?
And is your heart beating strangely?
I don't know who you are.
Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
It was everything.
-- I guess you haven't.
I'm sorry about --
I said get out.
Why don't you get off his case?
'To bed'?
Where are you going?
Gay?
Girlfriend?
Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
How long have you been standing there?
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
I am, too.
It comforts you, doesn't it?
I adore things like that....food I can't do without.  Don't you?
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
And I appreciate you, too.
Excuse me?
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
Joe, I'm with Drew.
Yes.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
Watch me do what?
I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
Then why are you here, Joe?
Joe --
I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
Goodnight, Joe.
Yes?
I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying.
Yes --?
I can see why.
I've got plenty of friends.
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
Come again?
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
What are you doing here?
The fireworks are about to start.
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
Oh, yes --
I love you, Daddy --
Daddy --
But what?
Are you relieved?
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
What a night.
I love him.
C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
Where's he going?
What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard, whether you like or not.
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for.  Well, they've arrived.
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
Where is he?
Where's Joe?
It's something.
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
Then what will you say?
Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.
Raise away.
Yeah, it's good to get together.
It'll come back, Daddy.
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
We've met.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
Are you okay?
What is it, Daddy --?
Daddy, what's the matter?
Thank God.
You're terrible.
I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
Bravo.
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
That's all?
Don't get dirty, Dad --
You're not listening --
So what's wrong with that?
What were you going to say?
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
Uh oh --
Probably.
You mean like you loved Mom?
...There's a start for a meeting.
I thought you were in a meeting--?
You're only six-five once.
...Then don't.
Yeah.  I guess so.
I hope so.
Drew told me.
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
Good morning, Dad.
...We know so little about each other.
No --
Because I like you so much.  Now I've got to go.
Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.
Why?
No, it was so right it scares me.
I've got to go --
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
I've got patients coming in --
Not at all.
Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital.
I could be her.
Me?  Internal medicine.
How'd you know?
So you're a one-girl guy?
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
I agree --
What's the way?
I'm sorry --
You and 'Honey'?
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
So why did you come here?
You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
Did Teddy send you?
Are you Teddy?
Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
My boyfriend told me about you.
You're the memory guy?
You tell me.
Well, that's me.
What are you here for?
Don't just waltz in here dressed like			  * that and order a beer.						  *
What do you want?
What?
Sweet.
On the house.
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
Why not?
Can I ask you something?
About your whore of a wife?
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
Kill him. I'll pay you.
Get rid of Dodd for me.
Help me.
Don't protect him.
What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
No!
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
Calls himself Dodd.
Somebody's come. Already.
He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
I told him about your car.
This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
Yeah?
He'll kill you, Lenny.
And?
What are you gonna do?
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people.
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
His name was Jimmy.
Just relax.
Your wife?
Such as?
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
Kill him.
Did you?
Yes.
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me.
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
Sleep okay?
You know what we have in common?
They treating you alright?
I wasn't helping you for money.
It's isolated.
I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
Tell me about her again.
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
Yes.
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear.
Is that what your little note says?
Yeah.
You told me.
You did explain, Lenny.
You don't remember me.
I know.  And now?
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
If they attack you...
Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
I'll be on board by noon.
Would you?  Because if you couldn't, I would be very lonely... I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen.  But none of this will happen.  So it doesn't matter.  Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all you see around you...look around... is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono.  He is my man.  And you are a smuggler moving a load...
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
Is this the protective male talk?
Where would I go?
Would you find me...?
When?
Really?
'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
Do I need it?
Why?
In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, "Live now because life is dust."
What's the best fortune you ever got?
I forgot the napkins.
Hola, viejo.
Maybe I'm only one.
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
Available cash is not an issue for us...
The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.
And you're our thirty-percent partner?
'Cause you don't lose loads?
Good samba dancing...?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Is it December?
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Like...?
Exactly.
That's right.
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
To mothers.  And all that we owe them...
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
I insist.
Tell <u>me</u> everything.
Later!  Do you dance?
I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?
She's dead...
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
I never do business in Cuba.  And nobody goes to Cuba but me.  And he is not my husband...
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
Havana.
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
Show me...?
How fast does that go?
What do you like to drink?
And what is that?
What's "nothing"?
What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for?
We want it back.
Right now.
You do.
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
I like the diminished risk.  It frees up capital reserves.  I like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent.  You can predict their behavior....
I think José suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...
A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
They will kill you.  And then they will kill your wife, too.
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. José knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
Of course!  That is why I placed myself here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap.
That sonofabitch!
Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.
"Future" of...?
Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000.  Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided...  No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil...  That's the deal.
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
What's your name?
We're no leaving you!
Which way?
What?
Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
But the power...
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
Manny...
This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
No...
Just inner chambers...
No...
Peter...
Ah...
Your arm, you can't...
Oh, come on, come on!
That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...
The scent won't last...
Peter-
Just do it!!
Rub it on the windows!
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
That's camouflage...
No, Jesus, no.
Don't.
It's me. Can you hear me?
It didn't bite me.
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
I was just late.
Right.
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
No such thing, baby.
He was just doing his job.
I heard how you talked to him.
No, there's...
Metaxonycha Godmani.
Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
Don't you get it? It's more than that.
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
I'll be late.
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
You know what I mean...
Do you think we did the right thing?
Please.
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
You sure you didn't see one of these?
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
Hello.
I know.  Help me get a sample.
My God.
And they're not fully developed.  This thing's not even an adult.
This wing configuration. I've never...
It bit you.
I have no idea.  Are you ready?
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
What's this?
Oh, Jesus.
What?
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
But you didn't even taste your cocoa.
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
It's right this way.
God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?
I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
What do you want to know?
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
Oh, my!
Did I do good?
Ahh!!!
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
Yes, Paul.
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
What things?
Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.
Paul, this will be our legacy.
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
That's disgusting.
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
Don't talk to me like that.
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
Now don't fuss, Paul.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
You've been out of your room.
Paul, I know you've been out.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?
You really think so?
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
To Misery.
A toast?
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
Oh...
I hope you like it.
Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
I'm going to play my records all day
Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you?
Not even a hint?
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the "n"s.  Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
What?
You said you can make it so they gotta turn the page. You know, "I 'gotta' know will she live," "I 'gotta' know will he catch the killer." "I gotta see how this chapter ends." You said it. I don't usually buy that magazine. I only got it, 'cause they were interviewing you.
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."
You can--you have the "gotta"--
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
But not you. Not with my Misery. Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there couldn't have been any "experimental blood transfusion" that saved her life. Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul, so you'll have to start there.
"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"
I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know.  Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered--  --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, "This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. Think of me as your inspiration.
Here, in case you think of any ideas.
It'll only take a second.
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
What's the matter? I'll tell you what's the matter. I go out of my way for you. I do everything to try and make you happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you. And what thanks do I get? "You bought the wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on this paper, Annie." Well, I'll get your stupid paper, but you just better start showing me a little more appreciation around here, Mister Man.
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I'll set everything up.
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
See, isn't this nice?
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
So you've indicated. Do it.
Then light the match, Paul.
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
Yes.
Yes.
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."
I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver.
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
She slipped away? She slipped away? She didn't just slip away. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You murdered my Misery.
Then who did?
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me.
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real commitment.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.
No problem.
Done?
I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
I don't know about you, but what I did to get through it was I dove into work--days, nights--night shifts can be lonely at a hospital. I did a lot of reading. That was hen I first discovered Misery. She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems.  'Course, I suppose you had a little something to do with that too.
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world...
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
Thank you so much.
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.
Your agent said she would tell her you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
It has no nobility.
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
Nothing.
Oh, like I could do that?
What's it about?
What's your new book called?
You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
If you wouldn't mind.
It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe...
And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done.
Lucky for you, I did.  Lucky for me too. Because now you're alive and you can write more books. Oh, Paul, I've read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels...
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.
Of course you will. And your arm will be fine, too. Your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly, but I finally popped it back in there.  But what I'm most proud of is the work I did on those legs. Considering what I had around the house, I don't think there's a doctor who could have done any better.
Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.
The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.
They're called Novril--they're for your pain.
Here.
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
It's good you found it.
What is it?
What thing?
Oh, I like that tone.
That's nice.
What?
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
You don't think he's dead, do you?
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?
You really think Sheldon's out there?
Could be the weight of the snow.
What? What is it?
Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
Four or five days ago. Why?
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
I hate that I made this call--tell me I'm being silly.
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
Yes, he is.
Yes.
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
I thought you were over it.
Now you've hurt me, Paul.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
Here it is.  Very first copy.
Did they win?
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
You're still a writer.
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
What are you talking about?
If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.
Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
Lovely.
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
A change of plans?
Sort it all out.
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.
Well, that's good, isn't?
To win?
Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
'Thief in the Night?'
I suppose I did.
Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
And my room?
Your room.
Ahh..
How do you that.
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
Well that depends.
I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
Oh Ethan!..
How do you suggest I go about it?
Ethan, tell me -
Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
I managed.
I'll muddle through.
Where do I meet you?
-- his left jacket pocket.
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
Just about..
Just like old times.
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
Yes?
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
Probably that I needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I couldn't possible sort out myself..
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
Much.
Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
And that's the only reason?
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
I'd like a little more conviction..
But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it..
Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
There's nearly 2 million in London.
What's the population of Seville any idea?
That's because I'm on my back.
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
That they're lying.
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
They've got a book for this?
When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
Who wants to be decent?..
Awfully short notice..
Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about?
What's you name?
Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
Your help?  What are you talking about?
Listen to what?
Where did you get this number?  I don't even have it!
Hola..
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
Indeed.
Do what?
- right..
- this is very disconerting..
Where's the bloody -
- right..where is it?
Would you mind if I'm on top?
I see.  You're not just another pretty face..
What are you doing here?
Uh-huh.
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
No.  Should I?
Yes.
Donít Jim.
All ten million.
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
You knew about Jim?
Krieger.
Krieger can get it.  Right?
Always.
Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
This stuff is so sticky.
Ethan?
Ethanís right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
Two cars.  Where are you?
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
Okay...
What happened?
What are you going to do?
Bastard!
I'm going to try and get some sleep.
I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan.
What about you?
You didn't have to.........
You don't think we're going to make it.
Sure...
What kind of help?
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
Max made a deal with you?
The message is for Job.
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
What are you going to do?
Why haven't they brought us in yet?
No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
Who is they, who is they?
Who is "they?"
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
What?
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
What happened to Jim?
What happened to Jim?
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
Roger that.
Oh yeah?
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
Sleeping's better.
I'm walking.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
Did we get it?
I wouldnít worry about him.  Once youíve got the money -- heíll find you.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private.
I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
Very good.
Mm - Hmmm...
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
Why should I?
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Why, may I ask?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
It's quite out of the question.
On what?
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
Who are you and what are you doing here?
Phew!  Weíve got five minutes...
Run it through from the top.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
Try it again.
Whatís the problem.
This wasnít what we discussed.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
And go to confession.
I want you to stop seeing her.
Have I been a good wife?
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
You're welcome.
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
Cosmo?
Where you been?
Why you drinking so much?
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
Again? Johnny Cammareri.
Who's dead?
I don't know whether I saw you or not.
You're my father.
You're married.
What are you doing here?
I got it done.
Mona?
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
It's temporary.
Here.
Yeah.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
In a month.
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
Johnny Cammareri.
He got hit by a bus.
The guy died.
Yeah.
I'm getting married.
You look tired.
Here.  Ti amo.
Pop, I got news.
You're not sleepy?
Where's Ma?
Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
What!
I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me!
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
Ronny, please...
You've gotta get outta here.
He's coming.
Ronny!
I'm freezing to death.
Let me go home.
Let me go home.
Why not?
And you're not now?
I'm afraid of who I am.
I'm really afraid.
I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?
The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.
This is where we're going!
This is your place.
You're late!
He didn't come!
I know what I know.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
How can you ask me that?
It's really cold.
I wanna go home.
No thanks.
I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick...
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
That was just so... awful!
I like parts of it, but I don't really get it.
They get some turnout for this stuff.
So. Where are we sitting?
For what?
Kinda gaudy.
Who painted that?
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
Hi.
Alright. Where's the Met?
Alright.
What are you talking about?
What?
But that's cause he don't know!
I'm telling you you can't.
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
Snap out of it!
Why not?
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
What did I do?
You don't get along with anybody!
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
I'm marrying your brother!
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
This time I was trying to do everything right.
What? What have we done?
Oh my God.
I've never seen a moon like that.
That light.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
Get all of me. Take everything.
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
I was dead, too.
Me neither.
Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
Where are you taking me?
A wolf without a foot!
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
Because I have no Luck!
No!
I'm telling you your life!
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
You really are stupid, you know that.
You think so?
You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
Just Johnny.
Seven years ago.
Stupid.
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
Why what?
Yesterday.
Instantaneous.
Bus hit him.
He knew my husband who died.
Loretta.
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
I know that. I do what I want.
I'm making you a steak.
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
Maybe I should come back another time.
I don't understand.
Excuse me.
Yes. Do you want...
I'm going to marry him.
Yes.
Let me come and talk to you.
He's in Palermo.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
Johnny.
It's Johnny Cammareri.
You? No.
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
Hi.
Hi Loretta.
Yeah, I'll be in.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Bye, Aunt Rita.
I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
What's the matter? You look crazy.
Right.
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
I got things to do.
Where's the ring?
In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
WHAT?
I have no secrets from my family.
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
I can't. I need my family around me now.
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
Have you told her we're getting married?
How was your plane ride?
Sure.
You have a brother?
Who is he?
You've made me very happy, Johnny.
I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
A month from today?
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
How about a month from today?
Then let's set the date.
How near is she to death?
What about the wedding?
So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time.
What time is it?
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
Yes, on the floor.
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
Are you proposing marriage to me?
Bobo, take the cart away.
What?
I shouldn't.
What's the matter?
You never have dessert.
She was too young for him.
Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
You don't want the fish.
Oh God, that's too bad.
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Do you love him, Loretta?
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
It was a miracle.
WHAT!! She was dying!
She recovered.
He's with his dying mother!
No more he's not.
What? He's in Sicily!
Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
Where's pop?
No. But I have a hangover.
No. Are you drunk?
Are you drunk?
Everything's different.
Your hair's different.
Well. I don't really know where to start.
What the hell happened to you?
Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old.
A wife knows.
What! How do you know?
Cosmo's cheating on me.
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Where you been?
Hi.
Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
Did he tell her?
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
How's the mother?
No. He don't.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
And we'll sell the house.
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
I'm thirty-seven years old.
Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby...
I got married before, you didn't sell.
So we'll sell the house.
Pop don't like Johnny.
Why not?
No.
Will you live here?
Pop.
And who's gonna pay for that?
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
No.
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
No.
What about the moon?
What's the matter with him?
Hi.
Alright.
I know.
I know.
I... a... slept with my fiancé's brother.
Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fiancé, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
Okay, I'll tell her.
No idea.
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question.
That's it! That's the reason!
But why would a man need more than one woman?
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
That's incredible.
You're kidding?
A miracle. Well, that's news.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
Yes.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
So.
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
Come on in.
Moving in?
Good night.
Sure.
Good night.
I'm too old for you.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
Sure.
What you don't know about women is a lot.
I think it's because they fear death.
Why do men chase women?
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
I'm a housewife.
Don't shit where you eat.
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
That woman was a student of yours?
What do you do?
Will you join me for dinner?
None of your business.
She was just too young for you.
I'm not disturbed. By you.
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
She's got it.
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancé's in Palermo.
You got me.
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
You were a tiger last night.
You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
What would he be doing down there?
Is who down there?
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
Oh.
What? What?
Marriage is happy news.
And that is my last word on the matter.
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
It is quite late enough.
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
... Least of all my son.  It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
Cold is good--  Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
Gesture?
Yes.  Yes it was.
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
Then why send me back to them?!
I will not hear any more about my safety!!  You made me a promise and now you have broken it!
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
Duty?!  You talk about duty?!
The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
I do not accept.
Yes?
Has someone seen to those bruises?
I was told you were in a fight.
John?
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next.
Must they always follow us?
What is it, John?  John?
To keep out the cold.
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
Of course I shall say what I have to say.  I always do.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
I am told so.
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
Craobhan-geanmchno...  How can I possibly say that with a straight face?!
Those, over there, there.
What are those?
Yes.
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
He thought so, yes.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
Mr Brown.
Yes.  That will be company for you.
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
And the pony?
You are well?
You are here safely.
Mr Brown.
I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral.
This is my good John Brown.
I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
Is that not enough?
Then they may read about me.
But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
How ill is he?
Why was I not informed?
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
Cold is good!
Whom?
Why was I not told earlier?
How long has he been this sick?
Has he been hurt?
Unwell?
Why?
Well?
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
What is he doing there?
Just them?
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
What do they want?
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
From whom?
What is it?
Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?!  I am not a fool.  I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert.  And now they attack Brown too.
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
Why not?
Who told them that?
Read it!
Read it.
And now I am back.
We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.
No.  I shall be out walking.
Why?
Please make sure it does not happen again.
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding.
What is the matter with him?
Then why are you not with him?
Why is he not here?
Where is my son?
That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.  But you are not eating enough.  One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
Maybe he's not dead.
Dead?
But how can it change every time?
How do you do that?
What's the question mark?
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
We're having some problems with ARCADE...
There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
It's the game, ARCADE.
How'd you know it was us?
But you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth.
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
Did you play ARCADE last night?
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
Has anyone seen Greg?
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
Never been on a snowboard.
There never is.
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
We don't have a choice!
Screamer.
Look around...
Our time's up.
Check your read-out.
There...
Yeah, that's what worries me.
The clock's already ticking.
The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
You've got the schematics, check.
Got it.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
One.  In case...
You feel it?  It's different this time.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
What?
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
Yes I am...
Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
Put in a quarter.
What are you looking for?
You didn't hear me?
Dante's Inferno.
You got the schematics?
I can't believe you made it!
What are you going to do?
No I'm not...
Virgin sacrifices?
I was afraid you'd say that.
And beat it at it's own game.
They made ARCADE.  It's still a game, right?  It thinks like a game.  Maybe it still has to play by the rules. Someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?.
SLIP-STREAM.
Then where do we go?!
The Police, then...
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
...but then it hits the relay stations...
Like the fractals?
Nick, what is it.
What?
Where do we go?
We can't...
Change the channel!
Let's go around back.
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
Laurie's.
She thought Benz was at school.
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
Sure.
Because I didn't know where else to go.
All of them?
Something's happened to them.
Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
It turned itself back on, Nick.
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
So how did it know my name, then?
It is.
No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here".
No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
Turn if off!
Can you turn off the game?
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
Funny.
I'm coming over.
No, in person.  Now.
I have to talk to you.
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
Nick...
Hello?
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
Yeah...
So where is he?
Well, it's a long story...
Go for it.
And then keep on driving?
I'm okay.
I know.
Oh God...oh god...
In this world, wrong is right!
Which way?
Then we'll go home.
Thought so.
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
I'm thinking!
Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!
Wait!  No!  That's not it!
What did he do to you?
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?
Yes...but...how did you...
But I don't understand...
Mom?  You're alive...
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
I'm just offering a place to stay.
I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
Will you meet with him?
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
It's been a very strange day.
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
You're broke!
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
I know.  Where are you Adam?
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
They fired everyone.
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
Adam, where are you?
Good luck, honey!
Right. See ya.
Get going. You don't want to be late.
Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
You're really something Coco...thank you.
Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
Sweetie, look at me straight.
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
I was afraid of that.
Your Aunt called me.
You got it! See you later honey.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
Wow!
I told ya.
It's unbelievable!
I can hardly wait, Coco.
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
No, I don't.
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
I guess I've come to quite a place.
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
I...
You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called "tits and ass."
Well, I ...
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
Are you okay?
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
No, no, I'm fine.
Hi.
Very pleased to meet you.
Yes.
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
I can call them... I can call my dad.
You're still here?
Betty.
What?
Was anyone hurt?
Can you tell me what happened?
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
But it said #12.
Diane?
Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet.
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
But I want to.
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
I know what you have to do, but let me do it.
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
Rita... I know what you're doing.
No.
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
I don't think...
Keep going. Go around to the back.
No... but...
Do you know them?!
Those men in front, in the car.
What is it? What do you see?!
Don't stop!
You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
Okay.
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
Good luck!
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke.
Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn.
I'm all right.
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
"Then they'd put you in jail."
"Before I kill you."
"Before what?"
"Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."
"What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
"You know what I want...it's not that difficult."
"You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."
"But you won't..."
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
"So... surprise"...
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
"Really?"
"I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
"You're still here?"
I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.
I'm not sure about this.
What's wrong with that?
Maybe...maybe ... maybe.
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
It's not my voice ... but I know her.
Call the number.
Maybe it's not me.
Strange to be calling yourself.
We'll take our check.
No. Just the coffee.
Not that I can see.
There's nothing?
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
Okay.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Okay... but just...just to see.
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
No.... I don't...
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
Mulholland Drive?
Mulholland Drive.
When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?
Unh, unh.
The money. You don't know where it came from?
No  There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it.  There are things there.... but I'm... here.
You don't remember anything else?
I don't know.
How do you remember how to talk?
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
What do you mean?
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
What do you mean? You're Rita.
I don't know who I am.
What's wrong?
I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
What is it Rita?
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
No...I need to sleep.
But, this could be serious.
No.
Oh...
I think I've been hurt.
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
No ..........I.
Thank you... thank you very much.
Betty Elms.
Yes, Sir.
No, we don't.
Wally Brown.
To my audition.
Bye....
Yeah a real shame.
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
That was eleven years ago.
What are you DOING here ?
Just stop it. End it here.
What about you ?
What was that ?
Do you know where you're going ?
I don't get it.
Where are we going ?
Great...
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
This is cute.
Let's go.
You okay ?
Okay.
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
I wanted to let his family know....
I... I .....
I'm in charge of the conversions.  When First Bank buys another smaller bank, I'm in charge of converting them to our systems and way of doing things.
How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
And you believe that ?
What do you mean ?
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
He hired you to build this place ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
Why did you build this whole place ?
So why this ?
How long till the room fills ?
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
What's the trick here ?
I'm listening.
Not listening !
You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
I'm not listening.
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
What ?
I'm leaving.
McCay knows ?
First Bank ? But how ?
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
So what do we do ?
So where does this lead ?
Come on, it works.
You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
How do we get out of this room ?
Now where do we go ?
I'm not fucking him..
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
No !
What about Matt ?
Why should we trust you ?
Where are we ?
What's going on ?
Why don't you shut up now.
No.
Hey buddy. You okay ?
He was right behind me !
Come to the rescue again I see.
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
What now ?
We made it !
Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.
I'm fine.
Zach from work ?
What ?
Shut up ! It's me.
How's your foot ?
We just having our first date when you showed up.
I'm talking to you asshole !
Which one, this door is locked !
Are you okay ?
I think we should follow him...
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
No ! Just get up. This is serious.
Wake up, we're in trouble.
Yahoo !!!!!
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
You have a real nice place... how can you afford this working as a temp ?
Are you okay ?
What an incredible view !
Thanks.
Hi. I brought some wine.
Sure.
As appealing as that sounds...
Yes.
Yes.
Do you want to go out with me ?
I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
Excuse me, gentlemen
Thank you.
Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
Good morning.
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
People said she looked like me.
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
Do you still teach?
Umm, where do you want this?
Are you writing a poem?
I don't even know your name.
THANK YOU.
I don't think you're very polite.
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
Gee, that is a problem.
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
This is California, anything is possible.
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
How did you know my name?
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
I'm leaving Sunday.
Pommeroy.
His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?
Suspended from school, my mother??
Wow, you walked out with my mother?
What do you remember about her.
Can I see him?
We have a baby?
What happened to Shelly?
Give my love to Shelly.
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
I will. How's Shelly?
Totally.
Yeah.
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Hi Dad.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
What does that mean?
No nuns, got it.
I used my own money and got a great deal, it's a Q47NR five day fare, which means that I have to change planes in Dallas and stay over a Saturday.
I already bought a ticket.
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
Was it a nice funeral?
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
There's still a big spot on the floor.
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
So you're saying...What are you saying??
It's just a question, it's not about anybody.
Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
Seriously.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
No it's okay, I understand, really.
I figured you did.
Shelly's already told me all about sex.
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
So, what's on your mind?
Visualize a spare?
Okay, no problem.
You want me to move?
Do what?
I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.
Maybe he's wet?
I was pushing as fast as I could.
Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
You're being narrow-minded.
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
No.
And some taco chips so I can dunk.
Never heard of him.
Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?
Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
I don't know if I want to.
Then I'll throw up a little bit.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
They sure did! They got kicked out of school, they married truck drivers...these are my mother's greatest accomplishments? I'm sure glad I came all the way out here to find them out.
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
What're you saying?
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
Thanks.
It's okay really, I was just a baby.
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
oh.
Well...
I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
More than anything in the world.
She's beautiful.
Do you have any pictures if her?
And she saved it.
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
Special effects?
I told you it was a long story.
Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
You are?
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
I'd like to, thanks.
You mean, you knew about me?
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
What's the matter?
See you? He can smell you from there.
What are you staring at?
Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
It's just a corpse.
Come on in!
That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
But I wanna write about her.
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
Rose.
I guess you have.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
What can I do for you?
Hello.
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
You're Alfred Beidermeyer aren't you?
He's writing. Hello?
O.K. Thank you very much.
This is really very nice of you.
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
I never met my mother.
My mother.
The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
You think this is easy for me? You go out on the town and I get to be the bad guy. Look I don't want you to be some punk hoodlum delinquent but I can't do my job as a parent if you don't do your job as a kid.
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
You're grounded 'till you're fifty!
You're so clever.
Don't wake up Vada.
There's water in your bathroom.
Nicholas! What are you doing up?
What ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh?
Give it back Nicholas!
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.

An adventure?
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
This has been a real confusing day.
Nick?
Maybe this Jeffrey guy is...is my real father. I mean...look at me, I have the hair of a dead person and...and my nose, no one in my family has this nose, it could be the nose of...a...of a complete stranger,
Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something.
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.
It's not his fault!
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Right.
Hey look!
Really?
What's he smoking?
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
My mother stood on this very spot.
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
Leave me alone!!
Oh no?!?!?!
Owh...
In the tar??
What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
DON'T!!!
DON'T, come on!!!
Just give it to me!!
Give it to me!
I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
This isn't just a mood ring.
Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
And I thought I was weird.
At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
He is one of the great poets.
May I use the phone please.
You would.
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
You ratted on my mother??
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
Why do you argue with everything I say?
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
Change my name.
I'd never do that.
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team.  With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous.
Oh my gosh, here it is!
What difference does it make?
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
WHAT??
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
I got it all figured out, I know she went to Wilson High School, so first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go there and get a copy of her yearbook. That way I can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were.
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
He said it was a gift.
Thanks....
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
Okay.
I should do this myself.
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
A secret, I like that.
Maybe.
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
Bye.
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
Committed?
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
But...are you engaged or something?
She lives here too?
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
They're great.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
You like the way I cook...you think I make out a great invoice.  PHIL You and Nick and...and this...this garage are my whole life...I love you. Sure you don't have the greatest taste in music...but there's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to sa...
I think this place is just fine.
I don't want anything you don't wanna give me.
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
There's plenty of fruit.
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
Phil for God sake.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
Sounds like you're very organized.
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
Bye Niece, Vada.
Bye Aunt Rose.
Yeah...right, it's pointless to worry.
She'll be all right baby.
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
Well just don't shave your legs...he'll never let you visit us again if I send you home hairless and full of holes.
Not exactly.
Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
I'm just tired.
What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
You're Nick's mother?
Oh, sure okay.
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Well I'm sort of involved.
Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
Well maybe for you.
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
Yes, I do.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Excuse me?
I mean...with your car.
So what's wrong?
O.K.
Let me hold him.
You have no idea.
Did it hurt a lot?
I know, look at his little hands.
He's so tiny.
Hey! Oh look.
Shelly?
You leave your father to me.
But Dad'll never go for it.
It would be fantastic.
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
What do you mean?
Why not now?
I'm definitely traveling some day.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
Oh Vada she's so beautiful.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
What's this? December 8th, 1958?
Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
Oh no.
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
You're telling me.
I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Is there milk in them already?
They're enormous, I know.
I bet your mom sang to you.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
He'll remember my mother for sure.  STANLEY It was a big class Vada and...but...well of course he'll remember, who could forget Maggie?
Do you know him?
He's a great poet.
Beidermeyer?
Really?
Wanna play?
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Arthur!!
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
You're such a baby.
Hey, you didn't pay me!
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
Ex...ex, ex...
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
The boss is watching us...
Keep your voice down!
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
The bee stings! I can't breathe!
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
It's there.
Can't you see it?
Yes.
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter.
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
Perfect.
I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
Pointing upwards Look...
Can we see it from the back yard?
Well, you were pretty great!
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
How's it going chef?
You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
It's only eight o'clock.
Good.
Kiss me.
Do you want to?
What are you wearing?
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
In ages, I know, me neither.
This is where we are.
Dance with me?
Did she ever see Vada?
What happened to her?
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
Are you mad at me?
You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush.
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
Home sweet home.
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
I had a good time tonight.
You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
Kinda like men.
Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
I just had a terrible thought Harry.
Does it make it easier to win?
Okay.
I love going to movies, especially at the drive in. I don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in.  I'll let you get back to work.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
No kidding?
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
Hi.
I'm sure she will.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
Harry, I really think she.....
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
Well the other night at dinner...
Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
You don't like it?
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
I promise i'll take good care of these people, they deserve it, they're dead, all they've got left is their looks.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
I need the job.
Excuse me, what about the job?
The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;
Stiffs??
They're dead?
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
It's still available I hope?
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Do you miss her?
Really?
What was my mama like?
In the garage.
I found this.
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
Did I kill my mother?
Get away, get away!!
He's okay isn't he?
Why not?
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
Yes.
Feeding my fish.
Hi.
I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
I like the freak show.
Yes..
When??
When?
Are they ready yet?
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
Sorry.
Can I go too?
Why?
You never cared before.
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
The money?
Dad??
Dad?
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
Then who's it for?
Is it for a child?
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
Dad?
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Ahem.
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
Bye.
Sure.
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Hi.
Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But I know he'll always be in your heart.
I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.
Get away from me!
No....
Who's that?
No he wouldn't, I can't go home.
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
I wrote a poem too.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
I paid the money.
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
What do you get for that?
How much does it cost?
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
This is one big house for one single person.
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
My Dad was funny?
Really?
Why?
Do you like her?
Does he love her?
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Okay, get in to bed.
I will I promise.
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
It's okay sweetheart.
Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
I think it should be outlawed.
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk.
I'm eleven and a half.
How old are you?
I don't want, I don't need your help....
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I'm hemorrhaging.
Well he just left, what's wrong?
Where's Daddy?
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
Daddy??!?!?!
Yes!!
NO!
NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
Oh great!!
I won, I won!!!
Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
Are you here to take Shelly back?
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
I like my name.
See food!
Uh huh, why?
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
Hi.
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
Aarrggh.
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
The boys at school don't think I am.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
Come here, sit down.
No.
Have you ever tried any?
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
A girl's always gotta look her best.
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
No.
Are you going out somewhere?
Okay.
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
Sure.
Can I use your bathroom first?
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other.
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
No, I'm divorced.
Are you married?
Mostly love, and romance.
What are they about?
Uh huh.
Did you read ALL these books?
Thomas?
I would.
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
Big Ringo fan.
Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.
Can we look around in your camper?
Hi.
Come on sweetie.
My ball, I lost my ball.
Vada? VADA?? What happened??
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
He won't give it to me.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
Shut your big fat mouth!
I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
Maybe black means you're happy?
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
Chocolate?
He's allergic to everything.
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
I am.
Who's winning?
Oh.
She's shy.
That's really cool.
Yes it is.
Is that your camper?
Oh great!
Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day.
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
They're just fun to read.
Liverpool?
Uh huh.
To chocolate?
Thomas J?
For what?
What?
Seeya tomorrow.
Well, let's spit on it.
Just, hurry.
Say something it's too quiet.
Okay on the count of three.
Just do it.
Close your eyes.
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Here, practice on your arm like this.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Uh huh.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Not true.
It is not.
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
I dunno..
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
No, I'm hiding out.
Leave then, some friend you are.
Then go home, baby.
He likes her better than me.
I don't like her.
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
Get up!?
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Do it!
Jump in the water!!
I am running faster!!
My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
What do you want it for anyway?
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
So?
What?
HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
What?
Go???
Duck!
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Bed wetter!
Pacifist!
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
Sorry.
Here.
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
What?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
It's my mother.
Yes.
Never mind.
You have no personality.
Hmmmm, interesting.
Come on, it's fun.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
No.
Uh huh.
It'll bleed.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
Hurry!
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat.
No, I'm going home.
Hi Mr. Bixler!
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
I knew he wouldn't come.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
I did what I came to do.
Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
And what will he do?
Needing.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
You're going to say it, aren't you?
Major.  Dish.
It's too late to start over.
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
I can't even say it.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
That was Thursday.
Try less appropriate.
I wish.
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
Let's not get carried away.
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.
Sure.
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
Because I realized.  When I see him say "I do," that knife will be in my heart.  And it will be there every...
I was devastated.
If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her.
What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
You're butting in.
You flew all the way h...
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
You have no appropriate sense of emergency.  My best friend is ruining his life.
I'll have to kill myself before I call him.
We'll never be the same.
He can't do that to me!
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
You think...
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
He's the salt of the earth.  Kind and loyal and generous.  The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.
No, he's nothing like me.  He's like you.  Only straight.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
That's entirely understandable.
I never want to go through this again.
Have you ever heard of. Irony?
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
I love him.
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
... that this is all my fault?
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
Don't you see...
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
Uh, Kimmy...?
I just don't want to freak him out.
Your call.  You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns.  Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...
He won't get mad, huh?
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
Only.  If he wants to.
He'll see right through it.
What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
Exactly what?
Exactly.
So... one almost has to...
Hello.
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
Gold nose hair clippers.
For the twins? What in the world is th...
... whatever is manly and independent.
But he always says...
Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
I mean, he loves his job.
Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
I just think you're wrong, is all.
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
About Michael's job.
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!
Ju...
Jesus, we're trapped!
He has you on a pedestal.  And me in his arms.
I've missed a step.
You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.
You win.
I was gonna predict that.
And the answer was so simple.
No.
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
... except one.
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
Let me rephrase that...
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
And loving him means loving all of this.
After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
But he sure can kiss.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
... cigars in bed? I broke him on that.  But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
How about...
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
So your honeymoon is exactly where?
I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
... most sentimental schmucks I pity want a honeymoon after their wedding.  Just to top it off.
What? Because I'm a little understand...
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
Don't you have to be somewh...
He said that, too.
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
What else did he tell you...
Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
The twin part.  I like to remain impartial in my contempt.
Which was the disqualifying factor?
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!
Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
Can you watch the road?
But I can't be dry.
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
Excuse me?
You need a few dollars.
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.
Well, we're...
All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...
You are <u<so right.  What a nerve on that guy!  Bring my dress to church, huh?
Ex-cuse me?
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
I saw the show.
Right.  And then it didn't want to come off.  Exactly.
Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...
... unless he has a hump.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
Nobody has.  So far.
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I.
He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.
He's said some things over the past few weeks.  Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job.
I think he's been fired.
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
Is anybody watching?
I think you're making a mistake, sir.
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
That's little egotistical.
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
That is so romantic.
It's two weeks.
Why would she come here...
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
Lower.
Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
DON'T SPEAK!
This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.
Shhh.
The Big Hurt, huh?
You never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover.  As they say in the sport biz.
... your one chance for true happiness?
Well, it happens.
Oh, yeah.
Does that make it right...
She admits it's her fault.
BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
And your point?
Get married, apparently.
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something...
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
Michael...
A bad combination.
What happened?
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
Michael? What ha...
... maybe it's congratulations.
It means a lot.
You're right.  Easy come, easy go.
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
That's my point!!
I'm up against a deadline.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
Yes.
No accents today.
Well.
We danced to it.  Just like this.
The night we met.
I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days.
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
Me either.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
You've been the man in mine.
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
Have you.
If you like.
You miss her, huh?
Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
You keep saying that.
Like I said, dazzling.
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
Michael!!
Never can tell.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
Boy, those were the days.
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
I never eat when I'm serene.
Still.  All's fair in love and w...
I guess you're right.  That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
... all of it.  She's leaving her family, her friends, everything she knows.  She's putting her career on hold, and she seems a pretty ambitious, driven, kind of pers...
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
Should I whistle down a cab?
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
Where was that, Florence, huh?
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?
Waiter! Check, please!
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
Quite the little eccentric.
Endearingly absent-minded.
What's next?
Hate that.
Such as.
I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year...
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
What's the sec...
W...
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
... Thomas, yeh.
Michael, it's Wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on Su...
You've met her parents.
Well, sure.
Well, somet...
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...
MICHAEL!!
Well, if that's the way you f...
What is that sup...
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...
And to m...
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
The most important thing. Is being together.
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
No, those are socials you're thinking of... Saturday's usually.
No.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
You're from out of town?
Bye.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
Your hair fell out? Just like your father. Weak hair.
Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
Bet the sheets are grey.
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Next you'll be sick.
Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.
Oh... Well.
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
He's a member of our congregation.
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
No, I don't.
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
About three years.
It just is.
Yes, it is --
When I was little, in church.
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
That's what you said before.
That's unkind.
Oh.
Well...
Older.
Oh.
I'm not sure.
I can't.
I have to go. He sighs.
I have to go.
Doesn't it have a name?
Oh?
Oh.
What?
Hello.
I don't know who you are.
Who is thin?
Hello.
Well...How have you been?
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
Oh, Tom, of course. What are you doing in Nashville?
Yes.
I'm not sure. Where?
Who is this?
Yes. Who's this?
Hello.
I'm sorry but I have to go.
What?
Yea.
What...?  0h, yes.
Fifteen minutes?
What?
I'm not sure...
Oh.
Oh.
I'll be there.
What time?
It's me. What is it?
Yes.
Hello.
Duff--
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
I don't think that'll happen.
Where're you going to go?
There's nothing to say.
Duff, I love you.
What d'you mean?
Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Don't do that!
What're you going to do?
Day work.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.
You can have what I've got. It's right there.
About ten dollars.
Hi.
We can always do that, Duff.
They won't.
You will.
Don't deny me, Duff.
Don't, Duff.
I keep thinking about him.
What about your boy?
We'll be all right.
Well, I haven't come around.
Don't look so scared.
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
I don't want to hurt you.
My kids want me to teach them.
You know how to box?
You still didn't answer my question.
You didn't answer my question.
Am I as good as they?
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
What's wrong?
Yeah, that's so.
He could live with us.
Don't call them that.
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
Well, what d'you think?
No. But a small one.
What about that girl?
Don't push me, Duff.
What happened, Duff?
Thank you.
What d'you mean?
I'll have some coffee, please.
Your boy.
How did it go?
Hi.
What's he like?
How old is your boy?
Come here, Duff. No point running away from coincidence.
That's right.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
Surprised?
Are you married?
I didn't know you had one.
Just for the day?
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
What d'you mean?
That's the way he is.
No.
'Been up north?
Why did you?
Good night, Duff.
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
What?
No, on the porch.
I wouldn't have let you.
What d'you mean?
But I would like to see you again.
Not here, Duff.
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
Let's go, Duff.
Don't Duff--
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
I see. That beer made me dizzy.
How d'you mean?
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
They must work on the section gang.
What is it?
No thanks.
I like a place with lots of life.
You keep asking me why I'm here.
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
No.
How d'you mean?
What d'you expect?
Maybe.
That's right.
My father's the preacher.
Yes, aren't you?
Your folks live there?
In Birmingham.
I'm a teacher.
Oh yeah?
You working?
Haven't seen you around, have I?
You must be new in town.
Good-bye, Duff.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Don't be too hard on him.
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
How 'you gonna live?
They'll run you out.
Going back, huh?
Well, what're you going to do?
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
Come back some other time, will you?
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
Let's go.
Right here.
What's the matter now?
Like hell you ain't!
Now you stay put!
He's your son.
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
Shut up, Will.
Pour your own trouble, Will.
Let's stay here, Will.
No. Why?
Come on, Will.
Hi.
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
Don't play with me.
Take this off.
No. I only needed the code from you.
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
Let me get you another glass of wine.
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
How's the villa's security?
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
What's an A.I.
Easy...
Hold on.
You're out of time, man.
What is it?
My God... these people are insane.
We've still got to find the mainframe.
...And if I guess wrong?
Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
I know.
For Peter, that's a short trip.
He projects with neural implants.
Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
So... did you get a look at heaven?
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
Case... Are you alright?
What's wrong? Don't like flying?
Give me five minutes.
I'll get the car.
Yeah.
Case... it's four a.m.
Case...
Put the gun down, Case.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
You okay?
Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
Dixie McCoy didn't.
Won't that mean you're dead?
Too late?
A regular Fagan.
So you're a wire junkie.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
Go ahead...
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
That's not going to help.
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
Almost two days.
Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
You've been calling her name.
What's that supposed to mean?
I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
Couple of months.
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
What is it?
You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
Shut up.
How are you at riddles, Peter?
Get up.
Like what?
Who?
Peter... What do you think you're doing?
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
Oh. I forgot.
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
What?
I'm late for lab.
Right. 7:30.
Remember, that poet that we liked  the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
 uhh, must have forgotten-
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
Exactly.
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
Yes, it's lame.
It is?
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
I mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die?
Yeah, I know.
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
What's that?
This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
What is with this school and prom?
NASA.  Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.
College?
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
Petty good.
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
Sure. No problem.
Thanks.
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
Oh I know.
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
Yeah. Let's do that.
: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
Why do they listen to Guy?
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
How long will they watch us for?
Nice.
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
Well, do you?
What?
guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.
Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
Nope.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Gus, have you ever been in love?
YOU KNIT?
Oh, man! Who told?
Well excuse me.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
Right. Right.
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
If you say so.
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
Wow. It's packed.
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
You need my help?
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?

Hi!
Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!
Anita!
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
Cuuuute!
I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
How about this?
Very romantic.
Bridgework?
What'd you feel when you kissed him?
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
That is lingerie.
Now this is cute.
Mama mia.  Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
Okay. That's bad.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
Anita, remember espadrilles?
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
Senorita Josie.
Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
Jos, that's not what we're --
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
You don't think I can do it.
Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
Anita!
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
Forget it.
You stood for like a month.
Yeah.
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
Who told!
Roger in Op/Ed.
Guess who I did it with last night...
I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
Wings?
What is this?
George! What are you doing here?
Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?
Betty.
Do I want to be crunched?
Why?
Transitioned?
Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
He's my teacher!
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
What if I say no?
Gus?
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
They hid my car--
Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
Well, how would you define to parties"? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session--
Uhh, no.
Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
Kristen got a quote?
Oh. Right.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
It's an expose on cafeteria food.
It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
But I don't want it straightened out.
Hey--I can be out of control.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
A--flack jacket.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
You've done five of my ideas.
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
Five-- Six--
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
You said that already.
Oh.
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Yes. I'll go. Yes.
Maybe we should go in a different room?
Hey. There.
Rob's?
Oh my god.
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
Hey Rob, what's going on?
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
I-
wasn't even thinking about-
Really?
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
Thanks. And what are -
Rufus?
She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
Hear one.  Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.
You're twenty-three years old!
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
Better than I...
Yes, desperately.
Is that true?
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Rob. Please focus.
Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
I can't do this.
Good.
Are mom and dad here?
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
Josie Grossie.
It was a long time ago -
What!?
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
It's just for a couple of months.
For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
Better person than I.
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
That is so--weird that you name your car.
I finally found my story.
Please. Please don't walk away.
I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
But now you don't have to--
Wait, I was going to tell you--
You were attracted to me?
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
Yeah, I have.
It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
Well, are you here with anybody?
Thanks. So do you.
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Oh--yikes!
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
Do you think you'll find her?
To put us back together again when we fall.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
When are you going to open your eyes?
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
Why do you do that?
I know.
I don't have to say that.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
Don't look down!
Of course. I remember everything from your class.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
Are you--scared?
Thank you.
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
College. Haven't really thought about it.
Thank you.
Oh I don't think so.
Well, I'm definitely seventeen and  now definitely late--
Sure, why?
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
I love the way she writes.
Dorothy Parker--
Sorry. Forgetful.
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
Why?
What?
Experiments?
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
He stayed a long time.
Can't you make other creations?
But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
No.
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
Coming...
Just me, I suppose...  I'm restless.  I can't help it.
That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
I know.
I can't help it.
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
I know.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No!
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.
I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
Where's Jesse?
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
Jesse, help!
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
Hi.
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
Who?  Who's doing this to you?
Who, Jesse?
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
Jesse, God - what happened?
We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
Why won't you talk to me?
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
You want to talk about it?
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
Oh, Jesse...
What is it?
What is it - What's wrong?
Ghostbusters are fearless.
Maybe we can do that.  Strictly scientific, of course.
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
I'll get over it.
About what?
Anything?
Shhh.  Just concentrate.
I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
C'mon, cut it out.
I thought you might be able to make a connection.
So, you feeling anything?
Here.
Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room?  Fred Krueger worked here.  It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
It's a surprise.
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
Make a left at this corner.
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
You don't have to.  You just have to believe in energy.
At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before.  But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to "the other world" and neve do.  It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals.
Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride.
I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
I don't know.
Who?
This is amazing!  Your dream told you where this was?
World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
Are you okay.
Wow...
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."
I think it's sad...
Uh-uh.  Before my time.
I figured you might like some help.
I know.
You mean a shithead.
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
Let me look at your eye...
You okay?
That's okay, I wanted to.
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
How come?
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
All of them.
Hi, Kerry.
Thanks, Mom.
You're going out?
What's that?
Okay...thanks.
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
I'll need to take her things.
I'm sure you would.
Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
I'm serious.
Did she always have nightmares?
Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
Please Mom?  I just don't want to be alone.
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
I had such an awful dream.
I thought I'd wait for you.
Mom?
And you don't want to keep him waiting.
He's full of shit.
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
I thought I'd wait for you.
Hi Mom.
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
Last time, it was me against him.  I wasn't strong enough...alone.
He wears a dirty brown hat.  He's horribly burned.  He has razors on his right hand.
I know who's trying to kill you.
No, she's right.
Do you still...see each other?
To old friends.
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
He's close...
I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I...
He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please.
I think so.
Are you okay?
Let's try this way.
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
Kristen, can you pull us out?
He's too strong!  He was never this strong!
Nancy!
I don't know.
What's that?
How do we find him, Kristen?
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
He's heavy in the halls...
Freddy?
You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
That was different.
You did it the other night.
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.
Yeah, but I was really not good.
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
You like gymnastics?
Sure.
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
He's real.
That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?
It's an amazing gift.
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
I used to live in this house.
I -- I think so!
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
Thank you.
It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?
But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
Thanks, Max.
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
Max, where's Kristen?
Why is that?
A little basic, but nice.
Crossed over?
It's over.  It's over.
People are still dying.  After all this time.  Stop running away from it.  Daddy, please...don't make me beg.  You owe me.
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
You know what he did.  He's doing it again.
That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
It's been a long time.
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
No...
I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
What are we going to do?
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
We can try again.
Take us there, Kristen.
Remember -- open mind.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
The truth.
Then maybe you're ready.
Stop blaming yourself.
C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.
To who?
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
Just until we get things under control.
That's right.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
That's what I know.
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
I'm serious.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
Must have opened while I was away at school.
This is nice.
All I can say is this isn't something that's just going to disappear.  you're all going to have to face it.  Fight it. And if you're willing to work together... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears...I think we can beat it.
Didn't get much sleep.
Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
Call me Nancy.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
Oh God.
Anything?
But nightmares are the common thread?
Tell me about the kids.
We can't get to her.  I've tried.
Okay, straight talk only in here.
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
Your dreams?
Neil, please --
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
And what are they?
Lovely to meet you.
I'm a vegetarian.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
Hi.
Night, night, Honey.
You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting.
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
That was such a great evening.
Well... a shot at it.
Wait a minute.  What about me?
Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.
And then I... right.
So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
I'm not listening.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
Fifteen million dollars.
Films mainly.
Well, they can be.
I'm an actress.
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
I thought I'd give it to you.
Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is...  Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and...
Well... how have you been?
You disappeared.
Hi.
Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
But... wait... there are things to say.
It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...
This is certainly... ah...
You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
Excuse me?
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
How do you think I'm doing?
Jesus.
Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
What?
Damn, I forgot the jam.
Can I stay a bit longer?
Oh.
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
You and every person in this country.
What?
Okay.
Right.
Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
Both.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
Big feet -- large shoes.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
You've got big feet.
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
You think I should do Henry James instead?
What do you think?
Well, get a message through to him too.
My son's name is Johnny?
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
I have thought about you.
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
A bath would be great.
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
Hi.  Can I come in?
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
You've got to go.
There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
I don't know either.
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
Uh-oh.  That's not good.
Why?
So who left who?
Step aside.
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
Yes, you did.
What did you say?
You abide by rules like that?
Let's go in.
I was.
Busy tomorrow?
Too complicated.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
Why is she in a wheelchair?
Floppy, huh?
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
Okay.
If that's all right.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
Okay -- fine.
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
Yes.
And what happens next in the dream?
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
Hello.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
Oh -- Okay.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
Hi.
Bye.
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Thanks.  Well...
I forgot my bag.
Thank you.
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
No.
Really, no.
No.
No thanks.
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
Oh Jesus.
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
Thanks.  I'll think about it.
Really?
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
I haven't decided.
Nice surprise.
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
Yes...
Tempting but... no, thank you.
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
What's your name?
Yes.
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Is that right?
No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
Yes, Mister Harding?
Yes, Mister Harding?
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
Why?
And yet you suspect her.
But you have no proof.
Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.'  So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
Mister Washington.
Get up, Billy.
Who? Tell me!
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?
What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?
Tell us about it...
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
Yes, Billy?
Mister Sefelt?
Would you like to start?
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Good. Why don't you join us?
I hope everything is settled.
Welcome back.
Mister McMurphy.
No, it was irresponsible!
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
You men remain seated!
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
A vote is before the group.
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  You must try to talk about it, Billy.
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
Go on...
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, Mister McMurphy.
Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
Patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day.
Oh, I had them removed.
On this ward?
Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, Mister McMurphy?
Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
Yes... We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife. Now, who will start?  Billy.
Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Good. I'm sure we'll be friends.
Is there anything else?
Good. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented.
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
This is your bed. You may leave your things in that cabinet.
We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
Will you come with me, please.
Mister McMurphy!
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
Whaddaya talkin' about? There's at least twenty guys in there. Let's wake 'em up and get this party on the road.
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Wait a minute...
Wow! They're so quiet.
What? Where?
Are they all crazies?
What?
Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
Are you a doctor?
Who is he?
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Oh, yeah...
Okay, Mack!  Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
Oh, yeah...
You ol' fucker!
That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
He's dead.
I thought so.
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck.  Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck.
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
Is he one of the loonies?
That!
What's that?
Whew! Hiya, boys!
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
Of course not.
No, she wasn't my sister.
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
So.  How do we get to Rome?
Because.
No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
Excuse me?
You ask what room he's in, okay?
No.
No.
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
What is it?
What?
It's alright...  this is our destiny.
We found each other, didn't we?
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
Let's find a telephone.
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
--separate, in the evening..."
Dwayne Pinsley.  From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
There is one other thing you should know about me.
My car bumper has never held a winning sticker.
I'm a liberal!
No.
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
What's mezzaluna?
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
Ask her if she knows where he is?
What?...
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
Please, Larry.  I have to hurry.
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
We'll KNOW.
If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.
Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
Wait.  I have to write this down.
Hm.
Non.  Please.
Amazing.
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
Congratulations.
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
You...
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
Where are you going?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
WAIT!!  Where are you?
Damon Bradley...
I can hardly hear you.  Could you spell that?
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
Hello?  Is anybody there?
I brought you that, too.
There is no us.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Yes.
No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
I would call it-- unforgivable.
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
I can't believe you did that!
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
What?
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
GET OUT!!
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Yes.  I am.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.
No.  I just came by to apologize.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
No.  Course not.
No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
Yeah.
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
How about music?  You like classical?
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
So were you.
Why are you doing this?
I don't know if that's such a--
You were saying...
What are you doing here?
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
What?
You too.
Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
Well, good.  Good for you.
Oh.  That's nice.
You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
Hi, Peter.
NO.
Right now?
Mickey Spillane?
Please.  I need to know.
Tell me.
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
Why?
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
Where's Positano?
Why not?
Who says I don't love him?...
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...  a mirage.
So it wasn't real.
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
What?
Why are you asking me this?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
Yes.
Yes.
If it's any of your business, yes.
NO.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
Oh, come on...  What kind of an excuse is that?
How could you do this to me?
That was before I found out what it was.
That's not the point.
What?
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
Oh, hello.
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
What looks good?
Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.
Excuse me?
Well, to-- new friends.
Really?
Sure.
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Yes?
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
You would?  Really?
Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
Any night.
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
I just got here, too.  Not yesterday.  But, just now.  Today. Just a few minutes ago.  Yeah, we just got here...  I mean, I just got here.  I'm single.
Been here long?
Beautiful place...
You're Damon Bradley?
Larry, did you rent a car?
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
What about Larry?
And Larry?...
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
Oh.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
I didn't expect you back so soon.
Uh huh.
Kate is that you?
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
So...
When you could've found one in America.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
Yup.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
Yes.  He is.
He's a jerk.
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
Maybe I can change him.
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
And he is living proof.
No one's perfect, Kate.
Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
Faith, I'm kidding.  Is this how you plan to get what you want from life?  When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
My God... you're right.
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
What if he doesn't like me?
Whatareyoudoing?!
Is Damon Bradley here?
Joan Collins stayed here.
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
Amazing...
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
Peter found him?
I'll be back before you leave.
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
You sure you'll be okay?
No.  No, you go ahead.
I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.
What?
Who said I was going?
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
What about Peter?...
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
...and a fortune teller.
It was a ouija board, remember?
I know, but...
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
So you're just quitting?  Just like that?
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.
Okay, a lot of bad luck.  But that means the odds are probably in your favor now.  This is no time to give up.
A little bad luck?
So, you've had a little bad luck.
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
Why?
Packing.
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Hi.  Where've you been?
Hi-iii...
Men have ways.
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Like a detective.
I think it's time we got some professional help.
I meant about my idea.
That was really sweet...
And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
And then what, Faith?
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
Good luck.
What?
Faith--
Right.  Okay...  It's meant to be right?  This is it.
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
Nope.
Is he looking at us?
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Oh my God.  Where?
He's heeeeeerrre...
Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
Sure you did.
I never even got to be single.
Because I'm the one who's single.
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
What's she saying?
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
What did you say to her?
Right.  My brother.
Her brother.
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
Polo.
Larry bought himself cologne?
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
That was a long time ago.
You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to?  But maybe I was wrong.  Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
'Course he does.
You think he misses me at all?
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
Sorry.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
You expecting somebody you know?
Nothing.
What's that supposed to mean?...
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
I'm hungry.
Right.  So we should've been able to cover more of them.
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
Your brother?
Only, it's in Italian...
Only what?
A phone message.  Only--
What is it?
We're saved!
Oh.  Right.
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
A Butterfinger wrapper.
What'd you find?
Ah ha!...
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
So?
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
I just got a dial tone--
I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
He fell out.
What are you doing?
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
We lost him?...
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
Are you sure?
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
What?
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
Now what do we do?
Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
You okay?
You're coming with me?
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
Maybe.
Live happily ever after.
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying.
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
Thank you so much.
My God, you have...
No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person.
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
Of course not.  I told him I was going to visit a great aunt.  And don't tell Larry, either.
Does Dwayne know about this?
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
Because you were afraid to fly.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
You don't have a passport.
I have vacation time coming to me.
What about your job?
It's still the new year...
But it's July.
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
The woman at my dry cleaners believes there's no such thing as coincidence.
It's a coincidence.
It's a miracle.
After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think--
No...  I can just tell.
Have you seen him with someone?
I think he's having an affair.
Is that bad?...
Larry brought me flowers last night.
Kate, is something the matter?
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
People have problems, insecurities, flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive.  It's not settling, Faith, it's life.  Real life.
I know.  You're right.
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.
That's the problem.  When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies.  Dreams come true, the good guys win, people live happily ever after... all that crap.  Turn.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
But what?
I know...  It was.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
Come on, it's not so bad.
Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.
Yes you did.
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
Why don't you ask him?
No.  He's never asked me.
"Thrills"?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?
He's a podiatrist or something.
You don't have any idea?
I don't know, Kate.
What's he do?
So, he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator.
So?...
I don't know.  I don't think so.
Is he gay?
No.
Is he married?
No.
Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
I wish you didn't have to go so early.
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
So, what's your point?
But somebody wrote those songs.
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
Is everything okay?
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
I don't have an Amana freezer.
Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
Oh.
Scientologist.
How about that guy at the bank?
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
How about the other one?  His friend.
No.  He smokes.
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
I don't believe in statistics.
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
That's exactly what you are.
Giovanni.
But I do want to.
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
How old are you?
Oh.
I'd love to.
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
A porco?
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
Kate.
And you didn't tell her?
She what?!
Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
He missed me.
Larry, you've got to tell her.
Went to high school with him. But...
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
What?  You know him?
You said it differently then.
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
No.
Right.
No, why?
You miss me?...
Sorry...
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
Ten billion to one.
That's really romantic.
Mania.
Good strategy.
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
She's not here.
They're waiting for him to walk in.
Terry...?
Tommy, what happened?
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
Father Barry.
"In the church when you need me." Was there ever a saint who hid in the Church?
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me who?  -- who?
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
Terry...?
Then go ahead go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland the Middle West somewhere a job on a farm... .
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
He's going to have to grow up too.
Are you sure they're your friends?
Well, it's over.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
No, I can't let you. I can't, you're
Terry, for God's sake.
Terry, you're bleeding.
Terry, no, no... .
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
I mean it, let's get away from here, first Joey then Nolan, now Charley and any minute... .  ...I'm frightened I'm frightened.
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
Get away from me.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
Don't tell me don't tell me!
You... .
Told him what?
Terry what's happening to you?
Who says?
You?
Terry, what's wrong?
I know... I know... .
Pigeons... .
Go ahead, wear it.
I I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
Much more, Terry. Much, much more!
It's true.
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
It was Johnny Friendly who killed Joey, wasn't it?
What are you going to do?
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not I'm just all mixed up... .
What for?
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?
But that's living like an animal
And if you don't?
You don't believe in anything, do you?
But a priest...?
His racket?
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
Why, Terry, who said it was?
And when things get in your way or people you just knock them aside get rid of Them is that your idea?
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or or human kindness in your whole body.
Our Lord said just the opposite.
Terry!
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
What made you want to be a fighter?
Now what are you doing?
A dive? You mean, into the water?
Were you really a prize fighter?
No thanks... .
It's quite  nice.
Wham... .
I am?
In a saloon?
I don't know.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
Oh she's a beauty.
The things that go on.
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested in pigeons.
That was nice of you.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
The Golden Warriors.
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
I really don't know.
What for?
Thanks anyway.
I'd better go in.
Do you like pigeons?
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd get into bad company.
What?
What's that?
With a little more patience and kindness. That's what makes people mean and difficult. Nobody cares enough about them.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
The moment I saw you.
I can get home all right from here
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
In braids? That's right.
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
I want to be a teacher.
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
You know how the Sisters are.
I better get home.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
Everybody loved Joey. From the little kids to the old rummies.  Did you know him very well?
I'll get home all right now.
Which side are you with?
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
None of your business.
Give it to me my Pop's job
Let me by.
Pop!
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
He wanted to see me again.
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
Who is he, Pop?
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
You love me then?
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
Maybe so.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
What can we do against them?
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
I should hope not.  I hate you!
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
Yes I feel it in my bones.
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
Nothing is worth your life.
Be careful!
I'm afraid I'll faint.
What can we do?
Those creatures..!
I'm so frightened.
Look!
What do you mean?
Can't we get out of here?
Could it be some kind of college initiation?
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
Then..then what's that music?
It frightens me.
Where?
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
Is there time?
You mean...!
For what!?!
All others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff, compared to <i>her</i>  This one would have <i>died</i> for feathers, furs, and fluff...and so she did!
Oh, if there is only time!
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.
There are others.
I understand, Master
I would have time for my own pleasures!
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
The moon is almost gone!
When!?
Well?
She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!
It would seem so, Master
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
As you wish, Master
It would seem so, Master.
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
She loved the bull ring and the matador.  She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction.  Her dance is of skulls.
A symbol, Master.
Tie them that they may watch.
But they are not yet one of us.
No. No! No!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
I'm so frightened.
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
And the one driving the other car?
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
Yes.
Yes.
Lie face down on the floor.
Who is it?
Yes, it is.
Thank you.
You're good.
Who are you?
Ask him his name.
Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
Till they got busted.
Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together.
Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met?
Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.
Really.  Hm.
I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.
He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
Did you know that when you married him?
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
He called the day he escaped.
He'd call every once in a while.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
Why not?
He didn't want me to.
You didn't visit him in prison.
He gets that way when he's nervous sometimes.
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
No, thanks.
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
I know a Glenn.
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?
Go away, or I'll call the police.
I don't know where he is.
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
I'm not dressed.
You say you perform in the Miami area?
His assistant.
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
Oh.  Uh-huh.
Yes.
Call and tell you.
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
The manager's door is metal.
You're gonna use a ram?
They're in 7D.
That's all I wanted to know.
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
Sure, Daniel.
All right, but...
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
Daniel.  Listen --
Shut up.
You'll have to ask him.
You have to know what you're talking about.
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
Is that what you would've done?
And what happened to Carl?
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
It was an unusual experience.
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
In the trunk, yeah?
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
Coming to the Okeechobee exit...
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
Hello, Daniel.
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
You don't, huh?
You can live or die, it's up to you.
If you move, if you look at her again, you're dead.
What do you want to bet?
Put it down or I'll shoot.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
Leave it where it is.
Wait, I know him --okay?
Oh-kay...
Hello?
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
I'll need a last known address.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
No, I didn't know that.
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Who?
Quite a mess.
How are you, Raymond?
You know what I mean.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
You think I'd shoot you?
Come on, Jack -- don't.
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
You're not dumb.
I don't know.
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
I'm just going to the bathroom.
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
So she did help you?
You were going to see her?
Where?
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
You waved to me in the elevator.
What were you gonna do with me?
You believe that?
He killed a police officer.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
You really wear that suit.
You like taking risks.
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
Oh, God...
Or once.
Well, does it make sense to you?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
It smelled.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
I don't have a problem with it.
What, as a sales rep?
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
Love it.
No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here.
Don't leave me.
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
Unless you wanna tell me.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
Why not?
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
Think I could have them back?
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
That's my dad.
None of your business.
How'd you get this number?
Yes.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
I mean, romantically.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
You have to be kidding.
You'd probably tell me.
Nothing.
Bleeding on a country road.
Peter Finch.
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
Faye Dunaway.
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
You must see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow.
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
Sure.
Uh-huh.
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
Of course I am.
I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
That's funny.
How many was that?
Why, are you famous?
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
In my bag, in the car.
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
If I could have a little more room.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it that way.  Go on.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
Gee, I wonder why not.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
Why's that?
And is Foley a part of this?
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
What's going on, Glenn?
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel.
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
You're not?
Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
Glenn, take the exit.
Take the next exit.
Wait.  <i>Have</i> you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way...
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
Foley's not going to make it.  And if he goes down, Glenn, you go with him.
Do we have a gun in the car?
Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
No, that's not what I'm thinking.
You don't remember me, do you?
Glenn?
I'll send it to you at Glades.
Oh...
How's it going?
He took the week off so we'd have time together.  So far he's worked on his boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.
Hi, Ray.
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
Just a minute.
You're not my type.
Flyweight.
What'd you fight, middleweight?
I can tell.
You're a fighter?
The State Theater?
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
What did you call it?
Your dog was killed?
He said he stayed with Maurice.
He said he stayed here last November.
No, I'm not.  Maybe you know him. Glenn Michaels?
No.
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
Thanks.
That's not Maurice?
I'm looking for Maurice.
Moselle Miller?
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
It's possible.  Why?
None I'd like to share.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
I didn't have time.
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
Not at all.
He's pretty laid back, confident.
Hello?
Was it Foley?
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
No, he looks a lot...
He doesn't even look like that.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
Huh.
What'd I say?
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
I really gotta go.
Dad...
No thanks.
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
Can we change the subject?
He's about to.
Technically.  They're separated.
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
Thanks, Dad.
--Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.
It's beautiful.
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
So beautiful!
Well...sure.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
You were more like brothers.
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
You take care, Dorie.
Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
What do you get for winning?
How often you fight like this?
I'm Evelyn.  And I'm just a nurse.  But I'm not playing golf, and that cut needs sewing, or else it's gonna make a big lumpy scar.  Whatta ya say?
What's your name?
Win?
How'd you get this?
Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
Our doctor's gone too.
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
That's what I have to tell you, Rafe.  It wasn't a choice.  It --
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
Rafe --
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
How did you?...
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
Do one thing for me, before you go.
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
We're all going away.
It surprises me that I'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way.
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
I was hoping to meet him.
Danny's not coming?
Oh, this is Betty.
You too, Lieutenant.
Do you have to wear that hat?
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
Goodbye, Grandma.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
I remember that book!  Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.
Do you believe in all of that?
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
How do you like my hair?
This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
What happened?
It's that jerk Walter.
What's the matter?
Aren't we a little old for that?
Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
That loudmouthed little bitch~
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
Just what you underlined.
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
On what?
All right. What's the scoop?
He does?
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
I don't get it.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
I'll call you Later.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
We're going to take you home.
Maddy, what did you do to your hair?
Were taking you back to the nurse.
Where is it?
Go on. You can do it.
I can't. It's all too much.
They're waiting. Come on.
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
The only one?
Who knows. Remember...  Whatever Walter wants...
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
Wouldn't we all.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
So he started having affairs, and you got depressed.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
Welcome to the singles scene.
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
Peggy Sue!
Carol!
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
) Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that "the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it". Page eightysix.
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
Charlie really has a great voice.
Why do guys do such stupid things?
Lucky lady. Hi.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Then hold me.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
What about Janet?
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
Charlie? Was I dead?
I'm trying.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
I've got to go now.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
I know.
Oh, Charlie.
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie.  I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
Forget it, it'll never work.
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
Just take a look at it.
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
I just can't trust you anymore.
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
What are you doing here?
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
What am I going to do with you?
Why?
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
Charlie. About last nights..
What do you know about classical music?
I'm sorry Charlie.
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
A lot's happened since last weekend.
Charlie, let's make love.
You really love me, don't you?
Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
Come on, let's dance.
He's trying.
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen?
Charlie, how are you?
Right. I promised my mother.
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
Where did you get that sweater?
Good.
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
I thought it had a lot of merit.
Thanks.
Would you?
They'll learn to live with it.
Why wait?
Maybe I blocked it out.
Refresh my memory.
Oh yeah?
You drive like a maniac!
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
Pretty strange.
Charlie! Am I dead?
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
I know. Put Scott through college.
I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
Charlie...
Don't say that...
Have a nice day.
I beg your pardon?
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
Touchy, touchy!
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
Test?
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
But I'm remembering the future.
I wish she hadn't.
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once.  I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
Don't get your hopes up.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
It was Beth's idea.
What?
I thought I knew everything about him.
Ssh. He's great.
It's Charlie!
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
I hate chickens.
I can't do that.
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
For everyone.
I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
I'd love to.
Is that one of your poems?
I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
Don't you get along with your parents?
What are you shooting for?
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
Coffee and a donut.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
You don't?
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
Oh, you're both so naive.
Oh no!
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
He'll win.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
Yes.
The hat business is in trouble.
Quiet today?
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
I closed my Christmas club.
Open it.
Hi, Dad.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
I think they're going to deregulate it.
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
At my age? Don't be silly.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
I think I'm way ahead of them.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
That would be impossible.
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
Jack, I was just trying to help.
Does everybody have to hear?
Please don't shout.
You have four seasons, you have four slumps.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightheaded.
He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school?
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
What does Charlie think about that?
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes JellO.
Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
Isn't that awfully forward?
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
Would they go over my girdle or under?
Way to go, Mom!
I'm not the maid!
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
Where have you been?
You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares.
I don't feel very festive.
Maddy's party.
For what?
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
Peggy, do you know what a penis is?  Stay away from it.
What do you mean?
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
I had a dream that Grandma died.
What happened to you?
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
Would you get that, dear?
It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
Who was that man?
The house payments.
What about?
Sort of.
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
When did you start drinking coffee?
I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
Oh. I forgot.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
I'm home now.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
Mom!
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
I'm excused.
How do you feel?
I have a note.
The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
Mom!
Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
They're bad for you. They cause...red lips.
Don't eat the red ones.
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
I'm just happy to see you.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
But accidents can happen.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
You have an incredible memory.
Rosalie Testa!
You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
I came to say goodbye.
You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
I couldn't help it  I loved him.
Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
What do you know about hypnosis?
Like what?
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
Hi, Richard.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
Oh.	And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
When do we start?
Sixtyforty.
Wbat're you talking about?
Give me some credit, will you?
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
Richard, take it easy.
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow.
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
What're you doing?
Am I dead or not?
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
I don't know.
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
What's inside?
I	know what a burrito is.
What's that?
Sort of.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
What a great kite.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
What was?
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
Thank you.
Answer the question, please.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
Really?
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
Do you need a break?
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
What kind of movies do they show there?
Have you ever been to the Apollo Cinema on Sansom Street?
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
Do you take risks?
You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct?
Thank you.
Were you recently promoted?
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
Objection.
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
Objection!
Objection!
Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
Bring the light!
No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
Bottle-count.
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them.
I would try for them.
But they...they could still be....
Don't do this to me....
I can't....I can't....
No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
Just come with me!
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
What, you're afraid?
I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
Riddick? How close?
You sure you can keep --
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
Audrey?
How many you see?
Get out of our way.
What about her?
Think about what?
Riddick? What the hell are you --
What do you see? Riddick?
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
We can, can't we? Trust you?
But I just wanted to say --
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
Why, what'd you hear?
You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?
Entered our minds.
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
They're coming.
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
You did this? To yourself?
Show me your eyes.
What whispers?
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
What, switch what?
Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.
We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
How many bottles?
...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more....
It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
There....
Christ, you don't know what's out there!
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
It's starting....
This is it? Booze? <u>That's</u> what you have to drink?
We cannot go through there....
Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
Just shut up, okay?
This does not help us, Johns.
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
We're just burnin' light here.
Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and <u>that's</u> why you can't come up with a better plan.
How much?
How much you weigh, Johns?
For your own fear.
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
You coulda helped. And you didn't.
Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
Never said you were a hype, either.
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
Dancin' on razor blades here...
You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
He can pilot?
<u>Get the fucking cells over here</u>, Johns. What's the discussion?
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
60 years ago.
So what happened? Where are they, then?
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
Thanks for the tip, Johns.
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
Thought you didn't believe his story.
<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
Let's just be sure.
So why isn't it all bloody?
He used that?
Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
Like what?
No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --
What?
So now you know.
During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
Better keep moving....
No, no, I wanted to get away.
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
What?
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
S'matter?
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
We just keep him locked up forever?
And him?
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
Hey, me. Over here.
Hey.
Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad.
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.
It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --
Owens!
And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
Company's not here, is it?
So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
Oh, no. No, no, no....
And what about the cells?
Do what I say. Please.
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
Imam. Slow down.
No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can.
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
Riddick?
I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
For now.
Frightening thought.
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
Some prophet guy?
So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
I don't suppose....
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
I think you're drunk.
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
I think I'd like to dance.
How do you do?
If I change my mind.
Would you mind?
I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
I haven't been invited.
I'm sure you have.
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
Not tonight.

Yes?
I'm supposing.
Thank you.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
I don't know.
I really don't know.
Well..
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
How far does this train go?
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
They might think I was running away from something.
Immigration Officer?
How long would that take?
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
Bank?
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
Do you think I was faking?
Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
Magruder does.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
You'll never make it.  You've out- smarted yourself.
So that I will never be found.
I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
You-killed-him?
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
Larry Mitchell found out.  So you killed him.
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
If you're doing all this just for me.
I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
Frozen.
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
Killaine's wise to what?
You leave it.
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
Do you have to leave the note?
This must have cost a fortune.
Killaine...
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
And Betty Mayfield--
They'll look for you.
I was tried for murdering my husband.  Guilty.  The judge set the verdict aside.  There was one man on the jury--  --but he was afraid.  They were all afraid--of my father-in-law. That man followed me last night-- he came from him of course.  My father-in-law will never give up. Never.  He promised me that.  So I came to Vancouver, B.C. As far away as I can get from North Carolina.  And it happens all over again.  Almost the same thing. Almost the same way.  Do you wonder about this--
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
I have my own warrant.  Stop a minute, please.
They're going to arrest me.
I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
So have I.
Nothing matters.
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
All right--following me.
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
You don't know who he is?
Absolutely sure.
Then he's--
Then he's got to be a detective.
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
They know you here--know your name.
Dance? Here?
Is this the best you can do?
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
Certainly not to me.
Dance? Tonight?
There's a lot of night left to live through.
What time is it?
That's putting it mildly.
Bad enough.
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
No thanks.
There wasn't any plane.
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
That's all there is.
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
I don't.
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
Not with my consent, strange as it seems. I don't know how he got in. I don't know anything.
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
There's one less tonight.
You said it wasn't a tragedy.
Much too late.
No thank you.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
Do you think I don't?
I hate to be alone. But I've heard all the approaches there are... even yours.
I didn't say anything.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
You're drinking it.
And do you amuse the guests?
You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
As I said before...
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
What did you say his name was?
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
I see.
Your liquor laws..
I see.
No, please.
Ale. I don't mind.
Beer?  Well, all right.
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
But even if you were in love with me.
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.
What will they do to you?
To do what?
Because you think your in love with me?
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
Very ridiculous.
What does he see?
Points very straight to her.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
I expected nothing else.
I don't want to talk.
There isn't anything you can do.
You understand perfectly.
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
The police always do, don't they?
You were there when I last saw him.
Is it a crime?
Who hasn't--one way or another?
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
We wouldn't have met at all.
I've never been to Florida.
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
A graduation present.
Yes.
Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
I'm sorry.
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
Who told you I was married?
It is?
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
Oh, many things.  Inertia ... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve.  We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge.  A new broom with very old bristles.  When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on Chartism.
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now  the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.
Shall we go?
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.
These are transcripts of various radio broadcasts, including Gaitskill's, the one they tried to stop.  You ought to have that ...
The references are to Hansard or to newspapers.  I haven't got the actual speeches now.  You'll have to chase them up.
We'll see you next week, and if--
Don't be silly.  I'll look out some more Suez material for you. You'll be very welcome.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.
I think you'll do very well.
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
Here I am lecturing you.  Have some pâté.
If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
And I'd like you to call me Ann.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
Good.  Suez was a minefield for both parties.
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
He's a little unhappy.  I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
Tom, Daddy would like to see you in the garden.  And will you ask Betty to bring us some coffee. And remember to say 'please'.
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas.
In your car
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
Jeremy phoned this morning
Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
I might.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
Well, you should.
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
Did she talk about me?
I think we're ready now, thank you.  And how was Norfolk?  Did you get on with my mother?
You just might.
I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
I have to be up early.
Yes, if you like.  Call me at work.
Well, you know...
I called you a taxi.
Damn.  They're early.
That must be rather nice, in a way.  I mean, you don't have any--
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
And you're at this third stage
My real father?  Well, he was a flashback.
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
And I didn't like that man.
I think it went on rather too long.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
Yes, that's right.  I'm being terribly rude.  Bob?  Oh, Bob. This is Bob Tuckett.  Bon was at Oxford too.
Was that your chapter, then?  It was very good.
So it's all worked out perfectly...
No, he wasn't.  He just lowered himself into a bar stool and said...  'Oo I do feel bad.  I 'ad three pints of lager and six onion bajees!'
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
Promise?
Oh, yes!  Where's mine?  I want to look like you.
What have you got there?
Don't point it at James!
Oh no!
It was last year.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
You're so famous now.
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
Actually, I've been once today already.  I'll stay here with him.
Don't you want to walk, Tom?
Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
I won't.  Goodnight.
Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?
So what'd the other guy look like?
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
Those are cold.
You don't have to.
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
Look at you.
You had enough?
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi can smell it a mile away.  He'll take you to the edge... and past it.  Hey, Bodhi.
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Catch of the day.
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
This gonna take long?
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
What do you want?
He's not really my uncle.
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
Georgia.
You don't know anything about me.
It's... it's not like that.
No.
Please, we hardly know each other.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
It's not your fault.  You're right.  Kit's right.  But I want the fairy tale.
I didn't think so.
I do.  I do want to.  That's why I'm leaving.  That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now.  I want a guy like you for real.  Not because you buy me things and give me money.  The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that?
Aw, don't... no...
I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
It was good.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
Business.
Right.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
What did you do to him?
You just did.
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."
I'm sorry.  That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
Did you?
I more than liked it.
But don't they have it in English?
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
I've never been on a plane before.
Huh?
Where are you taking me!?
What if someone tries to steal it?
What if I lose it?
Edward, I can't.
What's that?
Do I look okay?
I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
Fuck off.
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Stuckey!  He wants an "appointment" with me after you leave.  You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
Real genuine guy.
You did.
What id we run into someone I know?
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
You still mad at'm?
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
You always been rich?
What about dinner?
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
Come with me?
Okay.
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Uh-uh.  No work.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it.  Except with you.  At your price I give my all...
You liked the guy, though.
You're upset, huh?
Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
You're forgiven.
Oooh!
Hello?
... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
Any good?
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.
I got a dress, yeah.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Holy shit.
Three.
But you want days too.
Four thousand.
Five full nights... days too?
It'd cost you.
What?
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
What are assets?
What?  Why?
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
... dollars?
No shit.  They expensive?
"Occupational hazard".
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
Where'd you go?
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
Just a romantic, that's you.
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Why?
Oooh, thank god.
Where are they?  Shopping together?
Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.
I've known a lot of everybody.
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
Do you plan everything?
Can I have some chips?
Diet coke.
Off the boulevard.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Why?
Better believe it.
What?
Edward... you got it!
What's your name, lover.
Three hundred.
You couldn't afford it.
No, but it's getting there.
I never joke about money.
For an hour.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
It pays.
What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
What motel you staying at?
You're not from L.A., huh?
Mind if I turn on some heat?
Stolen?
Nice car.  Yours?
Sit... and spin.
The price just went up to ten.
Sure.  For five bucks.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Great.  What do I look like a tourguide?
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
You looking' for some company?
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day.
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
Couple a hours.
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
You sure you won't come with me?
Do I!?  Momma!
Want a pair of boots?
So did I.  I made it with the principal.  Study hard And get a "B."  Lift your dress and an "A" you'll see.
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
What kind of school?
Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart.
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
Go for the bucks.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
I pray for that.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
Dummy.
It was great.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
Where do you fit?
You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
Yeah... I know what you mean.
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
Kit...
Yeah.  I just got it.
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Who did you think?
Was that you?
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
Yeah.
In Beverly Hills?
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
He... he just does.
Why'd he want you?
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Kit!  Where've you been?
'Lo.
He's not gonna want us.
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.
Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Looks slow tonight.
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.
We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
I bet.  That was our rent!
Carlos had some great rock.
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
You bullshittin' me?
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
Yeah, what?
Thanks!  Consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can't do this on their own?
Oooh, I love those.
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
Okay.
What?
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
Hi, Barney!
Me?
Professionally?
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
Steak spoon!
I like steak.
But what if they serve soup?
What if they serve soup?
Hmmm... I vonder vich.
But I always eat like this.
Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
Will I like it?
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney.
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
I got a dress.
Niece?
Vivian.
I... Edward...
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
I'm just going to my room.
I was in here yesterday.
Do you remember me?
'Scume me.
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
What is with you?
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
Yes.  Something... conservative.
I'm just looking, thanks.
Get out!
Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just business.
I think it's great.
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
What?
Yeah.  Thanks.
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
I do not marry tonight.
Should I be?
Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
Every ship but the four you sent.
Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
He will come for me.
My Westley will always come for me.
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
And what am I?
Nothing you can say will upset me.
You mock my pain!
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
He knows I do not love him.
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
Who are you?
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
What?
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
We did it.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
What? -- go on --
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
We'll never survive.
I will never doubt again.
Well ... you were dead.
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
But how can you be sure?
But what if something happens to you?
I fear I'll never see you again.
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
Sam, if she's here...
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
I don't know.
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
All right.
Five hundred.
Of course not. Please.
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
How much?
No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
Can I trade in my car and take another?
What?
I don't need pills... just sleep.
Were there any calls?
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
I don't know.
I still feel...
Did he say anything about my sister?
Yes.
What difference does that...
Please!
He said he was dissatisfied... and was going back.
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
Forty thousand dollars.
She stole some money.
Yes.
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
I could stand something regular.
Why not?
Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
Hospital clean.
Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us.  Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped, so he must have found out something!
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
I believe it.
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
You going to wait here for me?
Huh?
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
Alive.
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
You're not.
All right! Then call! At least, call!
Yes.
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
Does that mean we can't...
Well?
Who's he?
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
Without calling me?
Where could he have gone?
Sam.
Just wait here?
Why can't I go out there with you?
Sam, I'm going.
Sam! Why call when we can go?
An hour! Or less!
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Yes.
Where's the old highway?
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
Where... can I stay?
You want me to stay here?
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
She haven't even called you?
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
I ought to call the police right now!
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
Yes.
I hate tears.
Huh?
Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
What do you know about it?
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
A good reason, I suppose.
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
Don't you know?
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
With you.
I want to know if my sister is here.
Is Mary here?
I'm Mary's sister.
May I talk to you?
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
Don't miss your plane.
I'm thinking of it.
I'll lick the stamps.
Sam, let's go get married.
I haven't even been married once yet!
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
Sam! No!
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
No.
I have to go, Sam.
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
Can you?
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
Sam. This is the last time.
I've lost my girlish laughter.
Sam!
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
Good night.
Crane.
Very early. Dawn.
I'd like to, but...
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
Norman.
Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
Wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace...
No, not like me.
Why don't you go away?
Except you.
She sounded strong...
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
You should... mind it.
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
Why do you ask that?
I'm looking for a private island.
Only my share.
You go out... with friends?
Is your time so empty?
A man should have a hobby.
I imagine so.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
You'd know, of course.
You're very... kind.
Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
I've caused you some trouble.
I'd like to.
No.
Thank you. Again.
I have?
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
The bathroom.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
Los Angeles.
I thought I'd gotten off the main...
You have a vacancy?
Why?
Now what?
I'm sorry.
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
Please... I'd like to go...
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Then I'm free to go...?
I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
I think so.
Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
Why didn't you eat last night?
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
There's no hurry. It's early.
I'll have it for supper.  So long.
But what about lunch?
Then marry Ralph ... you'll be the happiest couple in the world.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
You would.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
I don't agree with you.
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
Did you? Where?
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
What are you laughing at?
I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about Ralph. He's the sweetest kid I know.
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
Yes, why?
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
So that's the way it is?
I'd call it stupid at any time.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
I won't let you say that!
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
But why? She's the best friend I've got.
Delighted, I'm sure.
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
Ralph! Ralph!
Let me go! Let me go!
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
I'd love to.
But it was really my fault.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
But I think these things are beautiful.
We'll be coming to the opening.
I'd love to, at any time.
Thank you.
Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
I don't know what he was, but he made Frankenstein look like a lily!
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
How quaint. But I can go any place you can.
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
The body of Joan Gale!
I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
I'm going to make you eat dirt, you soap bubble! I'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go!
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
Almost! I'll still bet I'm right, and let you write your own ticket.
No kiddin'?
What do you mean?
All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is.
Let it go.
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
What!
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
I am right! I know I'm right!
So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
Which one is me? The horse?
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen Winton down there -- I'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
Nope, I'm through!
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
And they never proved anything against him.
Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
You give me a pain!
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
Quick, Watson, the cookbook!
And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire?
Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
Meaning what?
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
Thanks.
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
Make it snappy, Colonel.
Hotcha! Saved, one job!
What does that prove?
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
Old Howard Winton's cub?
No foolin' -- any suspect?
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
How's every little thing?
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
Ralph, come here a minute, will you?
No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.
Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
Horsefeathers!
Who? Old Santa Claus there? That's easy for anyone with my sex appeal. He's a pushover. Watch me stand that old dodo on his ear.
He might get some publicity out of it.
Don't worry -- she'll get used to it.
Fine, thanks.
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
Well, that being the case, I'll take it up with the board of directors. Hey, listen, aviator, here we are!
How much money have you got?
Oh, is that what caused it?
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
Darned if I don't!
Why?
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
That's what they're going to ask you.
That happens to be the truth.
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
You weren't going with her?
I see. Was that all she said?
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
That's what I said.
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
So I can move on.  You too.
What?
I've been dreaming about this.
I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.
And glow happily ever after.
Dysfunctional --
She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
Like now?
What did it want?
Of what?
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
What universe are you in, Paul?
We flopped the first time out.
Why am I doing this?
A place you've never been.
Could you?
What?
I'm heading out of town.
Day or night?
I said she isn't here. NOW you go home. Be a nice boy and go home.
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
Yes?
This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
A saint just like your own mother. She's up in heaven right now, her and Lunette, there ain't no doubt about it.
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
Take a little walk with me, huh?
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
I don't want to know...
Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!
I ain't neither. Listen here, Buddy, besides all his vast medical knowledge, he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin' ideas.
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!
But I don't know who they are.
I got an awful toothache.
Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
You're my sweetheart.
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
Buddy, Mr. Right is out there somewhere and I'm gonna find him!
Well, Ill tell you this. I have learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't gonna run around, but when I start botherin' your Daddy and worse robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the facts of life.  Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get myself up and go out.
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
Buddy, I have to ask you, as bad as I've been please have pity on me and don't ruin me by telling them what I did. I know it was bad, it was bad and dumb. But mostly it was dumb, I didn't mean you no harm, I'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that's the truth. I love you. But they'd think I did, they'd think I was awful, they'd despise me and hate me...
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
No. No, I'm all right.  Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!  I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!
You wouldn't understand.  Oh, God, I must be outta my mind. What would your Momma think?
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
You better quit that.
Well, nothin'.
Buddy, you're just a child.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
Don't mention it.
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
'Course it does.
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
What did you expect?
I fell madly in love with him when he called me Rosebud. You know that first day when I come and he said I looked graceful like a capital letter S and called me Rosebud? I fell madly in love with that man right then.  But it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a good man and won't have nothin' to do with me.
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
Buddy, you are in one of your evil moods, I don't want to talk to you. I'm going out and sweep the patio.
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
They were just bad men, that's all.
Nobody.
Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
Oh, yes, it's Thursday.  Hello, Rose, dear...  ... my, you're... looking pretty...
What'd you say, Brother?
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
What did you say, Brother?
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
Oh, Brother, I am so disappointed in you. You mustn't look at those horrible things, they degrade the human image.
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
Walked, in all that heat? It's a wonder she hasn't got sunstroke. I'll phone Daddy and you go get Doll Baby and Waski.
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
Why is it taking so long?
If it isn't a baby... what is it?
A baby... and she isn't even married.
What's goin' on?
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
What's happening?
You better not snoop, Daddy'll kill you!
What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?
Then why does she act so dumb?
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
No, Mother, he's lying...
You know, Buddy, sometimes you make me sick.
Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted to kiss her some more and play with her, but he didn't, because he loves Mother and all of us, and he loves Rose, too. Isn't he wonderful, isn't he great?
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.
Buddy, that was my place.
He had his hand on her titty.
He kissed her.
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
Wow! Brrrother!
Boy! Wow!
Let me see!
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
I can't see, let me see...
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
I think she's gonna kiss him.
Okay.
Yeah.
I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
She's watching the car again?
I think Daddy suspects.
No.
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him.
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
Who?
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
How is she?
Better off? How could she ever find love and happiness, if you did what you're talking about? Are you insane?
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
Over... my... dead... body!
This conversation is making me a little sick.
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
Honey!
What did you forget?
But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
She does look a little peaky.
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
She hasn't actually done anything...
She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson.
Sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit.  Your real trouble is that you're anti-intellectual. The irony is women are supposed to be emotional, but I never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do.
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
I don't see how you can even think of it now.
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
Honey, please...
I'll talk to her, I'll reason with her.
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
Is she all right?
What time is it?
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
You're not having lunch?
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
Oh. Did you say something?
What?
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer.
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
Yes, I am.
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
Mine.
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
You mean a farm?
Well. What kinda job is it?
Tennessee?
Yes, sir.
What's the use, there ain't none.
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
Well, it's Billy.
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
Yes, sir.
Yes, air.
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
Well, I don't know what happened. They were arguin' about baseball, then all of 'em started fightin'. As for that policeman, I didn't bite him, I don't think I bit him.
I got an awful bad cold.
Oh, no, sir.
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I'm not hungry.
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
Yes, sir.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
There are more on the other side.
Well, it has buttons.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
You're so sweet.
Yeah. I'm goin' out.
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
No, sir.
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Hillyer... I just... couldn't help myself. I'm sorry...
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
I... I'll get the grits.
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
What's the matter with him?
I'm only trying to help him, Mother.
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.
Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
Yes, dear, what is it?
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
Let him be guided not by my wishes and not by Rose's wishes, although I am sure they are identical. Let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself, because that is what has spoken through me tonight.
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
You'd go so far as to mutilate a helpless girl who has no means to defend herself, you'd go that far? Don't you think I know what you've just said and don't you think I understand the dreadful and revolting crime you've just conspired to commit?
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
Yes, go on.
What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
Gonorrhea?
Yes. Well. She's upstairs.
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
She looks terrible, just awful.
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
There are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair. Beauty is beauty and that's all there is to it. Beauty is there and we have to recognize it. Now Rose, the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is Doll Baby. She looks like an angel and she is an angel, but she can be a naughty angel sometimes, although her father won't believe it. Her real name is Frances, but we call her Dolly or Doll.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
And who do you suppose he is? That policeman who arrested me, the one I bit! He is Mr. Right!
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
Forget about it, I don't want you working in one of those honky tonks.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
I don't mind.
Rose, you don't have to.
Oh, I know. But I didn't, really. Honestly, I didn't. There was only one, but he's out of town and leave no forwardin' address.
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure.
I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick.
Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
Yeah, it's kinda nice.
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.
What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?
Yes, ma'am.
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
It'll get better now.
No more dentists, no more dentists...
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
Never again, never again...
Oh-hh, ohh-hh, Lord, he's gonna kill me.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
No, Rose, he'll help you.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
Be quiet, Rose.
I don't want to go to the dentist.
Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
I had better call Daddy.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
Yes, Ma'am.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
You look sick if you ask me. I hate to leave you with the dishes and all, but I'm supposed to go to a meeting of the Garden Club this evening.  I'll need the car keys.
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
Yes, Ma'am.
Well, you run on now.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
You're so sweet.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Well, I am working on my thesis.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
More history, Rose.
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
Oh, no, ma'am.
If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
I hope so my darling.
Maybe we could try it this way.
Oh don't be so shy.
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
Brad...
Weiss.
Oh Brad.
Right!
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
Well I want to leave.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
Brad, please lets get out of here.
Oh....Say something.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
I'm coming with you.  Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
I'm coming with you.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
Oh...
What was that bang?
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
For you.
Oh Brad.
Uh huh.
Yes Brad.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Makes you cry
Makes you cry
Promise you won't tell Brad.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
Who's Eddie?
Oh.
Oh, lucky him.
Are you - giving a party?
You're too kind.
Don't say that.
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
What're we going to do?
Apollo?
...What?
Is everything all right?
What did you say about a pet shop?
What was that you said about a pet shop?
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
...Yes --
...Are you going to say anything to him?
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
...And he called the reporters --
I thought it might be cute.
-- The legs.
Don't want weak legs.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
Like?
Don't you open them anymore?
Yes.
I'll be waiting.
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Don't tease me.
...What?
...T-thank you.
What?
I should leave.
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
No, I don't belong here.
I don't think I belong here.
It's not that --
It's fine.
I think he might be worried.
Yes.
Yes, I do.
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
Do you have a phone?
I sold them to you.
...No thanks.
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
Morning after?
I don't think you're a bum.
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
It doesn't bother me either.
...I suppose.
...I suppose.
My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
By accident?
Ohh!
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
And you never got the chance?
...Aren't you skating?
I think it's closed.
It's Thanksgiving.
...Goodnight, Rocky.
...I don't know.
...I'm sorry.
...Fine.
What?!
Good? Good, Paulie?! I've been treatin' you like a baby. Since I can't remember it's so long -- I'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- That's what ya use to call me 'Loser' -- What kind of name is that? So can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when I'm with Rocky -- I don't owe you, Paulie, you owe me.
Owe you what?
Don't do that again!
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
Only a pig would say that!
...Paulie. Stop now!
Don't talk like that to him!
It's not your house --
Paulie!
Roosevelt finished last in his class -- Beethoven was deaf, an' Helen Keller was blind -- I think Rocky has a good chance.
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
You didn't!
Oh, Rocky!
Paul.
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
I can't go out.
...Like you?
Paulie, please --
No... I can't!
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
Goodnight, Rocky.
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
I won't.
What?
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
Why?
Maybe I like garbage.
I like yella teeth.
...Yeah.
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
Stuff it, man!
Hey --
...Screw you, yoyo.
...Screw you.
Well, I'll be...
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
Yeah...
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
Sounds like singin'.
Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
What was <u>that</u>?
Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
So what's the scam, Eddie?
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
So you decided to help him after all?
It's all yours.
He's a riot.
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
Do you think the rabbit did it?
Bastards put him on notice.
A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
R.K. Maroon.
Is this paper even good?
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
Eddie, come on.
He made me laugh.
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
Where is he?
I didn't know who I could trust.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
Where is my Lady's lord?
I come for my lady Juliet.
Juliet!
Romeo, I drink to thee.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
O God!--O Nurse, how shall this be prevented? What sayest thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? Some comfort nurse.
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
What?
Amen
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman. I think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him.
Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
I have.
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
[Within] Juliet!
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
[Within] Juliet!
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
Juliet!
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
O God, I have an ill-divining soul. Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, as one dead in the bottom of a tomb. O fortune, fortune. Be fickle, fortune, for then I hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back.
Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
Ahhh!
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
Ay me!
You kiss by the book.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
Well I don't!
I don't know.
Of course.
Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
Leaving...
Is that right?
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
That's why you were riding with him.
And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.
And then...
Which leads us to...
The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
And who are you?
The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.
It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.
No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
They're good!
Not yet...
You lose them!
That's him.
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
Not to me, you know that.
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
Bloody fucking hell...
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
I'm a patriate.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.  I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.
That we're too stupid to trace his calls.
I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract.  Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.
Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
Just business.
I better be getting that.
Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
Nobody's saying they don't.
That's right.
I still am.
I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me to do that?
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
You were a soldier, were you?
He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker.
Don't do it, Sam!
That fucking figures...
Where's the case?
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
Next.
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
You sure about this?
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you?
Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
You know I do.
I don't believe it.
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
I don't know.  My friends...
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
I don't know, Booth.
How are we going to do all this?
A satellite dish?
I love you.
So do I.
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
I used to think he was something, once...  I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
I know.
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me.
Booth.  Don't.  It's nothing. It's not worth it.  Remember what happened the last time?
He's not, he's...
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well.  It's over.
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
I'm in here.
OK.  I love you.
Are you sure you're OK?
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
What's wrong?
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
Heard you had quite a night.
Hi.
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
Has he?
He's irresponsible.
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
What for?
Dwayne please calm down!
Dwayne -
Dwayne put the gun down --
It certainly is...
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!
Whatever...
Well I got the tires rotated, I went shopping, and I made dinner.
Don't you want to hear about my day?
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
I didn't say that.  You did.
That hasn't stopped you before.
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
It was going to be a surprise!
I can't hear a word you're saying!
What?
I don't know...
Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?
Well I don't know --
Don't you want it?
This whole place?
That's great Earl!
Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.
And what happened?
You do?
Are you hungry?
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
Did they ever find out who they were?
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.
How's work?
Is that the mail?
I didn't know you were coming.
Hi.
The real question is, where are the plates?  If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
They think I'm a crooked customs agent.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
El Capitan?
This is your ship?
I don't think so.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
Now you know.
I'm fine.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
Dip me!
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.
Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.
You move well.
I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
I need your help.
Put your arms around me.
Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.
It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
How about a lift home?
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
You don't like it?
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
It's called a dress.
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.
Jesus...what do you want?
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
You got a lot of guts calling me.
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
They put you in charge?
With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
What's wrong with that?
No...what?
The Feds?!
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
Where'd you get it?
Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
Yes.
Right.
I've got news for you.  No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
I'm not running.
You don't understand this guy.
At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
What is he up to now?
Of course.
Of course.
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
Good one!  Thanks.
And what did you say?
What did he ask?
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
He's here!... He's here!
It's hurting.
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
His hair... any color.
"Never say die."
"Make the shot."
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
No, she's talking about your hair.
Yep.  Maggie -- Someone to see you.
And you are?
Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
Are you a reporter?
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
It's something I've always wanted to do.
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
So, we'll...
I'm okay with that.
And the church.
Yes, you!
To who?  Are you asking me?
I love you, too.
Me, either.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
Really?
About a minute...?
I kissed him back.
Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey.
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
Yes I do!
That's called changing your mind.
What!?
Lost!
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
Brian told you that?
I already explained about that.
That was very interesting research George was doing!
It's fun!  It's high.
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
You humiliated me!
Yes.
Excuse me?
Where did you disappear to?
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
No.  You take it.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
You know, there's no...
What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
I'll have the same.
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
You don't know.
Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
So?  Is that what you said to her?
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
Still sweet.
What an incredible chauvinistic observation.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Maybe someday.
I think so.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
Six-fifty.
Seven-fifty.
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
He is not!
Give me that!
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
We think so.
Without oxygen...
Twice...
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job.
You're going to be very disappointed.
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
You have one?
Yes.
Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
Excellent.
I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
Quick.  Very quick.
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
What are you talking about?
Okay.
No, I'm just going to head home.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
I'm just finishing up, too.
You okay?  I'm closing.
No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
Let's go.
Not eight...
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
Grandma!
It's for the bell.
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
What happened at the luau?
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
He's going to be the pastor?
Would it?
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
Lighten up, what?
Lighten up, wahine.
Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
But I'm weird.
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
Why?
I'm going to kill myself.
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
Yes.
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
Where?
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
Ya think?
It's probably because you got him fired.
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
She's the boss.
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
Yup!
Reporter?
Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
You're a goddess!
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
No.  It's my life.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
Thank you, Dad.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
Not this one.  This one's on me.
Yeah.
No.
No, you tell her.
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
You take the microwave?
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
You don't love me, is that it?
Is there somebody else?
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
But it's on the water.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
I hate boats.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
Look!
Oh!
You okay?
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
I told you.  Nothing --
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
It's so beautiful.  It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from.  You see what I mean.  There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them.  Surprises are highly overrated.
Walter.
I do.
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
Well, I did.  And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect.
About forever.
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
You go.
And then I'll see you in New York --
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Thank God my life is in place.
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
I don't think so.
It's delicious, trust me.
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
Go for a walk in Central Park --
Walter, I'd love to --
Happy New Year.
Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
Even when you were young?
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
Is that all right with you?
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it --
They're going to love you.
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
-- who's married to --
I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
I love the symphony.
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
What are your plans in New York?
No, I'm not.
You're going to miss the train.
It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
What about the letter?
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
Made for each other.
M.F.E.O.?
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
So I mailed your letter.
Becky?
Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
This is a photo of hair.
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
You don't know who she was, Annie --
It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
It's a sign --
He said hello.
But he saw you, right?
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
I love that dream.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
You were standing in the middle of the street?
Good night.
I love you, too.
Thank you.  I love you.
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
Is this crazy?
What?
Becky?
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
You told a lie and got on a plane.
I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
Did you talk to him?
Definitely.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
What?
Turn on your radio!
Hello.
I always wondered about that too.
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
I know.
Men never get this movie.
Listen to this, I love this part --
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
Yes.
No.
Can too.
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
He lost all the weight... there.
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" --
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
"I want to meet you..."
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
What?
I should say something in this about magic.
Right.
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
You're a basket case.
Not.
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
Actually, he sounded nice.
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
Nothing's with me.
What's with you?
What was what?
What was that about up there?
There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
It's not true, but it feels true.
Whatever it is.
About what?
You should write something about this.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
No, I know that part --
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
I want my money.
I know.
I know.
Howard.
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Yes.
Come on, Jonah --
How am I going to explain this to Walter?
This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
You don't believe in signs.
It's a sign.
So you'll get married in a new dress.
Like... clockwork.
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
Mom, we already...
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Mom!
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
Magic.
Magic.  It was magic.
What?
You know.
What?
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
It wasn't a sign.  It was a coincidence.
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
Destiny takes a hand.
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
How amazing.
It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
How did it happen?
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
Are his folks nice?
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
We'll move them --
It's probably just the flowers --
Walter and I are engaged!
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
It's me?
Shhhh --
Hi.
Hello.
Magic.
Sure you do.
Why not?
What was it that made you know?
What are you going to do, Sam?
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
And I don't want to invade your privacy --
Why not?
Have you had any relationship since?
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
Fair enough.
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
Is he home right now?
You want me to talk to him?
Why not?
And you're worried about him.
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
Where's your mom?
You don't like the one he was now?
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
Yes. We will light the candles.
They are singing for me.
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
Later. When I finish the ironing.
No, Estellita.
With Ramón it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
To the mine?
What are you saying?
And if you can't understand this you're a fool -- because you can't win this strike without me! You can't win anything without me!
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Ramón were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
You mean you're ready to give up?
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
Ramón -- you can't.
Alone?
When?
Where are you going?
No. We can't can't go on this way. We can't go back to the old way either.
Tell me.
But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
I waited up till midnight.
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
I've had them since the day they were born.
I'm going back tomorrow.
Yes.
Sure.
Backward.
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
Let them take it!
What makes you so sure?
You are no good to me -- in jail.
What were they saying? About you? In there?
He'll have it good. Some day.
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
Was it expensive, the beer?
No, no ...
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
Never... never... never!
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
What has it got me, your union?
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
What's more important than sanitation?
What?
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
Where you going?
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
I don't want to leave you.
Danny, it's not what you think.
Why?
I don't want to.
What is it?
Really, I don't want to.
They would have killed you too.
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
What's wrong, Danny?
Why not?
I been that way ever since.
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
He knows where I work.
I need my paycheck.
We been through that.
Please open the door, Danny.
It's me.
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
What are you hiding, Danny?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
What is wrong with you?
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
This has nothing to do with him.
You really need to lighten up.
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
Nothing.
Is that how you play?
And you admire that?
Like you?
Never heard of him.
Trust me. We're safe.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
What happened to your eye?
How?
I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
Because he'll kill me.
Fuck you.
I can't leave.
You don't understand.
I can't.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
It's not that easy.
Go ahead.
What?
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
That bad, huh?
What about the guy on the very bottom?
How?
Oh God.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
I understand. Thanks anyway.
Why are you doing this?
That is so unfair.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Just admit you're wrong.
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
Look at that place. It's creepy.
You think that's a good idea?
Tom, quit fucking around.
You mean like the Donner Party?
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
No.  Right here on the beach.  Come on. Let's do it.
Tom, let's spend the night here.
It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
And you've got wiener breath.
I was talking about Miles.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
No, no he's not.
How can you, how can you say that?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
What's the profile?
Pardon me?
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
No, you're not a guy.
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
What does it say?
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
Did you sleep with her?
See you.  Bye.  Bye Diane.
Yes.
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
Okay, I got it.
That's just so embarrassing.
C'mon Lloyd.
Lloyd.
Lloyd, give it up.
Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you.  She's a brain.
Then what's love?
Going out as friends.
That's not even a scam.
But you never had a first date.
That's unlikely.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
What?  I'm sorry, talk.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
Look at his face, he did the deed.
He's got that nervous talking thing.  I told him not to speak.
Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd.
Lloyd is doomed.
I'm sorry.  It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new word.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.
I don't feel anything.
If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye.
Hello.
You're right.
I'm so ashamed dad.
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
No, but you stole from them.
Yes, I...
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
What am I supposed to think?
But I found the money.
Swear to god.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
Dad, are you okay in there?
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
Dad, I love him.
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
I like him a lot.
Dad, why are you acting this way?  Is this because of the other morning?
You're not listening to me.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
Dad, no.  But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
I know that.
I'm fine.
Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
Dad, I'm sorry.
Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.
Okay, I give up.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
Dad.
Goodnight.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
I won?
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
Tell me, is it bad news?
What?
I love you dad.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
Oh god, I don't need all these presents.  I don't know any kid who got a car, I mean...
God, that's... this is ridiculous.
What are you doing?
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
I didn't think anyone would get it.
You like it?
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.
You will?
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
This is me telling you about me.
Mom, please?
I know.
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
Not right now, thanks.
Okay.
Good to know.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm fine.
I love you.  Please, I love you.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
I love you.
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
I'm sorry.
Oh shit.
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
Just my dad.
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
No.
No I didn't.
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
No, I don't, I don't.
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
No, no.
We decided...
Yeah, uh-huh.
We'll see.
Yeah.
Well, I need to study, and...
I think that we should spend some time apart.
How can I look at you and say this?
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
No, we don't have to say it.
It was wonderful.
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
Your letter came yesterday.
Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
Then why are you shaking?
You're cold.
You're shaking.
Yes.  Are you shaking?
Yeah.
This is so noble.
Yeah.
Oh.  I was putting the...
Am I wrecking my car?
Right.
Yeah?
I'm doing alright.
Yeah.
Friends with potential.
Be friends?
I just can't have any social life right now.
I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
Well... just meet her.
Yes.
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
You have to meet Bess.
Okay, bye.
Stop by later.
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
Come on.
I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
You think so?
Yeah?
Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
Or, or I could always wear this one.
Then call me later.
Then call me tomorrow.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
No, I'm serious.
So what's your job this summer?
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
You know what?
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Yeah.  I'm so glad we did this.
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
Nobody knew me before tonight.
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...
Bye.
Thank-you.
He does this every year?
Yeah.
So it's an honor?
Keymaster?
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
What are these?
Would you hold this for me?
Goodbye.
Eight.
I'll go.
I'll go.
Well...
Actually, I think that I...
Hmmm....
Well, not monumentally.
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
Yeah, I have to help my father.
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
No, I read it on the message.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Yeah.
Yeah.  What a day.
Thank you very much.
Yeah?
Hi.  You called me?
Thank-you.  The real world.
Its over, Cotton.
Please, Cotton, dont do this.
What?
Did it?
Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
I did that.
What do you want from me, Cotton?
I don't think that's a good idea.
Cotton.
Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
You have a right to be angry.
Did you do it?
Enter Cotton Weary.
But youll never get away with it.
Finish what my son started.
What are you going to do?
Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
Jesus, youre just as whacked as your son.
Youre all in this together?
I couldnt believe you didnt recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
No, I don't.
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
Why don't you ask them?
And are the police sure about that?
Home--where he lives.
Where is Sidney's father?
Tons and tons.
Hi, Gale, any leads?
Good for you.
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
Do I know you? You look familiar.
And much richer as a result.
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
Fair enough.
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
Look, I'm sorry about the face.
But nobody wants to see that. Itll never go. Theyll rewrite you. You dont want that.
Youre not going to get away with this.
Why?
No. This is a set up.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
No, it's not.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
This is exactly what I don't want.
I'll get my jacket.
The forbidden subject.
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
Tuitions expensive.
Tails.
Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
So we found a compromise.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
A twist ending if you will.
And now, drum roll please...
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
Of course not. Who wants to? Whats the point if we dont get caught? Wheres the glamour in that?
Youre the one who got away.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
He hates Oliver Stone.
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
I got it..
He seemed harmless.
Randy somebody.
She's got guards with her.
I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
Dewey?
Let's go.
Jesus Christ!
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
This is all too familiar.
Ssshh! What was that?
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
And Joel's pre-med.
..and as lonely as I am...
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
Can we turn the light on?
What are we looking for?
Billy had alibis too.
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
Not good. How you doin?
Yeah?
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.
I never meant to imply...
You have every right to be upset.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
I see you read the book.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
Hello, Dwight.
Whatever.
Dewey, there's no such place.
No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
Yeah, right.
It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.
Oh my God. How could it happen?
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
No, wait...
You're getting obvious.
What do you mean?
What do you want from me?
Oh--a God complex
Where are you?
What do you want?
I don't play games.
Who are you?
Who is this?
Oh my God.
What?
But who would operate your camera?
Sid, I'll come with you.
My morn was a Delta.
It's good to see you involved.
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
I'm sorry.
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
The safety what? Fuck that!
I dont know.
Yes, goddammit!
Someones trying to kill me. I need the police.
You're going to get it. You know what happens.
Don't do this.
What?
He tried to kill her first.
Too bad.
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.
I have rehearsal.
I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
Oh, Sid, youre sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
Can I come with her?
I'd really just like to be alone.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
Who is that guy?
Yeah, right.
That was good.
I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu- drama?
Gotta.
What about rehearsal?
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
Time to change numbers again?
Hello?  Hello?
Knock yourself out.
But...
Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
Thanks, Joel.
You're not allowed to ask that.
This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
Don't panic.
I'll be right back.
He's after me.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
Me, too. Randy. Me too.
Do you work for her now?
What do you want?
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!
OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
Four? There are five.
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
Please, call me Gale.
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Who?
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
Alright Kincaid, no where to?
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
A note?
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
Oh yeah, how?
How is that good news?
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
Hmm.
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
What do you mean?
Excuse me?
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
Did you request this case?
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
You seem to like movies, Detective.
What do you know about trilogies?
Absolutely.
Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
They've got her!
Where are you Dewey?
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Yeah?
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife.  These two lethal weapons.
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
I can see nothing's changed.
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.
Sidney, what happened?
I work better alone.  Why don't you do some snooping around the set?
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
Thank you.
What?
Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
Fuck!
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
And who is that?
Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it?
I'm sorry, this is too good!
Someone stole Sid's file?
And?
Always.
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
Show him.
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Your life?
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
Good twist.
Nobody said she was an actor.
Bitch.
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
Basements creep me out.
Gale Weathers would find a way.
Possibly.
There a story in that building?
No really?
Need to get in that building?
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
That's funny.
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
None.
Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
I am Gale Weathers!
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?
Geez.
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
Oh shit it's my cell!
Who's phone?
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
Still that was a much better movie, I saw it at the premiere last week. God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
Are you saying she was-
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Just because you knew her?
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
They're the ones who approved it.
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
GALE WATCHOUT!
Let's get out of here!
I know!
I know! He killed Kincaid!
Gale he's got Dewey!
What are you talking about?
We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
Who's this.
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"
What'd he say?
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.
I thought you wanted me here?
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
Yeah?
WHERE?
Where?
You're dead!
How do I know their voices are --
Yes.
Who is this?
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
W-what do you want?
Who the fuck is this?
I'm sorry, your voice.
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
Are you sure?
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
Are you alone in the house?
Stop it!
I don't understand...
Why did you kill my mother?
Fuck you.
NO! Don't believe him.
I thought you were...
No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
Uh-huh.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
Who did you call?
Yeah... I think so.
You heard me.
Or even a good porno.
I wanna let go. I do...
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
So...
It's okay. We need to talk.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
No...
You know that's not true.
I'm so sorry... please understand.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
Jesus, SHIT!
He's here. He's trying to kill me...
Oh Billy... Please... God...
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
You know what my dad will do to you?
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
Oh it did?
Now that it's out of your system.
What are you doing here?
My dad's in the other room.
What are you doing here?
Billy? What the...
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
What?
...leave me alone... please...
You tricked me...
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
No it's not. It was Jason.
...please... no...
Please go away! Leave us alone!
NOOOO....
Michael... Michael Myers.
I can't think.
Please..stop...
I don't know...
No...
Don't do this. I can't...
...please...
No... please.
Please don't do this...
What kind of game?
NOOO!
No...
Why are you doing this?
Please don't hurt him.
Where are you?
How do you know his name?
So you better leave.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
What do you want?
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
Is this some kind of a joke?
Listen, asshole...
No-bored.
Dial someone else, okay?
What do you want?
Yes?
Gotta go.
Nah, I don't think so...
I have to go now.
That's not what you said.
What did you say?
Why do you want to know my name?
No.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
I don't know.
Uh-huh.
Just some scary movie.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Uh-huh.
Popcorn.
I don't think so.
Who is this?
Hello.
They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya.
What?
You're forgiven. Bye now.
So why did you dial it again?
Hello.
It happens. Take it easy.
I think you have the wrong number.
What number are you trying to reach?
Who are you trying to reach?
Yes.
I'll get my camera.
Sidney's father?
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist...
I like it. It's... sexy.
So is Dewey your real name?
Can I bring Kenny?
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
What kind of lead?
Mind if I join you?
Then what are you doing here?
You never know when or where a story will break.
Deputy... good evening.
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
He's not a suspect, is he?
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer.
And why is that? Has something happened?
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
What is she doing here?
Shit.
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
Yes, you doofus.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
Should I be worried?
Have they found my father?
Yeah.
Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
And my Dad? Any word on him?
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
Any word on my Dad?
I don't know. I guess.
At the airport.
Did you reach my Dad?
...yeah...
As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
What's the delay?
Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother?
I saw him leaving wearing it.
He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
Has his story changed?
Many times.
Have you talked to Cotton?
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
Do you still think he's innocent?
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
You owe my mother.
I owe you shit.
Please. You owe me.
Forget it.
Off the record. No cameras.
Kenny. Camera. Now.
I want to talk to you.
Just stay back.
I'm not here to fight.
I'll send you a copy.
I'll look for it.
It'll be out later this year.
How's the book?
Yes, that's right.
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
Who are you?
LEAVEMEALONE!
Hello?
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
What am I doing?
Can you see me right now?
So where are you?
Why would you call me from my front porch?
So where are you?
So who are you?
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who can't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
I have no idea.
Have a good trip.
Got it.
...out at the airport...
No you didn't.
Can you knock?
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
Stu was with me last night.
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
Don't come any closer.
Stop. Right there.
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
You'll never get away with this.
You're crazy -- both of you.
Why are you doing this?
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
Are you serious?
Why are they doing this?
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Deal.
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
TATUM!
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
No way.
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
Who?
With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
What do you think about when you're having sex?
Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
Oh, god...
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
Come on, let's rock.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
And you believe it?
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
So you think my mom was a slut too?
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
I don't know...
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did.
I bet he's pissed.
Shit, what is he doing here?
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.
Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
Come on, Sid.
It's alright. I'll get it.
Take a message.
I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw.
He was there, Tatum.
Do you really think Billy did it?
No, nothing's like it used to be.
Just like old times, ain't it?
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Bye.
Whatever. Just hurry.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
I'm not worried.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
It's past seven.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
Later.
Thanks, Tatum.
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Tell your mom I said thanks.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
How do you gut someone?
Or a man's mentality.
They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than...  Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big.
They think it's school-related?
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Do they know who did it?
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
No way.
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
What happened?
Do you believe this shit?
What am I? The beer wench?
Tits -- see.
That's mature.
For once, Stu, drop it.
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
I thought you dumped her for me.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
I want to have children.  It's just...
I hate this city.
I don't know...
I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
Perfect example.
I'm sorry, I only...
I don't sleep very well.
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.
If you can, please call me.  Please.  I have to go now... goodnight.
How long have you lived here?
It surprises me.  It really does.
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down.
It's a nice name.  William, I'd like you to meet David.  David... William.
It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
Dear Miss Laury...I take pen in hand to let you know Ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them Com- anches the late Mister Futterman told us about...
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
It isn't fair...
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
Finish your breakfast...
Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
Wouldn't bother me...  I wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was I you...
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?
Ain't worth the mendin'...
You don't remember?
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
What?
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
What are you talking about-
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
Martin, what-
Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
I haven't the slightest idea.
The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
In the village.  Look what I found.
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
Yeah... I have to go to town.
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
Martin, it's not funny!
Someone from the village.
If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
I miss Tommi so much.
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
Cherry-red Tears.
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
I just had a really strange experience.
What are you doing?
Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
Yes, daddy.
My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
You?
Do you have a better idea?
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
Do you know where fuse box is?
Hey... the fuse.
Maybe the antenna's broken.
I mean the armchair!
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along?
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
Stop that!
Oh God, Tommi...
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?
Come on, say it.  You know...
But what is the truth?
Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
I really hate to bother him, but...
Thank you.
Ellen.
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
1976.  What happened back then?
Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
Do I look like it that much?
Ellen Straub.
No, I've never seen him before.
Hello.  Can I help you?
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...
I've killed my husband!
And that is?
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
Every word.
Thomas Kent!
What happened to Sam?
No Juliet?!
I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor.  I am sorry, Will.
Nobody knew!
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King!
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
I am not so well-born.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
Oh, but they can!
And I love poetry above all.
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
Your Majesty
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Write me well.
Nor you for me.
I don't know. It's a mystery
But all ends well.
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the dukeOrsino.
An excellent beginning  Let him bea duke. And your heroine?
The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.
If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
Will you read it for me?
But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
You lie.
You never spoke so well of him.
Will! What--?
Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
Oh, but it will end well for love?
That's my line!
Oh, Will!
Oh, do not go
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
Oh--no, no!
Mr. Henslowe?
It was the owl--come to bed
Moonlight!
You would not leave me?
And that was only my first try.
Even your play.
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
I do not know how to undress a man.
Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
Can you love a player?
Oh, not for the world!
If they find you here they will kill you.
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
Oh but why "alas?"
Anon, good nurse. Anon.  Master Shakespeare?!
Who is there?
He is dead?
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
I am going to church.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
I meanYour Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
Good morning, my lord!
I will do my duty, my lord.
The Queen has consented?
But why me?
Virginia?!
I do not love you, my lord.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
You flatter, my lord.
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
My lord.
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
Don't you ever stop?
You mustn't take it so badly.
It's about me and David.
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
Oh, shut up, Alex.
We were just sorting things out.
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
Alex.
Everything.
I'll wait there.
You're frightened.
It's the only way.
Aren't you going to answer it?
No.
Forget it -- he'll come down.
Where he can't get it?
And the money?
Forget it.
Oh, good.
David?
Your painful groin?
What are you doing here?
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Leave him alone.
I don't see the point in that.
Don't you?
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
Then let's spend some money.
Are you all right?
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
Hello. Hello.
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
That's not him.
No, I don't.
Who?
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
For ever and ever.
Sshh.
Stop nagging.
Be careful.
OK.
I don't want to. It's different.
I don't thinkI can.
Who's going to do it?
Unfeasible.
No, Alex. It's, it's --
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
No.
Don't.
What are you doing?
Alex.
Did what?
Yes.
Yes.
Open it.
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
So what's wrong with that?
His car's still there.
David?
So I gathered.
Have you seen Hugo?
No, Alex, we don't really love you.
You're right.
Yeah.
The man we know and love.
-- which is --
-- instead of what he is --
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
Not usually this drunk.
Alex.
So we'll meet him, then?
Who was it?
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
She hated you --
For the flat.
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
I thought you stopped going.
Just serve.
OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
Yes.
Cameron.
It wasn't like that.
What?
Eh, I don't know.
Yes.
So let's go.
It was on the television.
I should hope so.
With a face like this?
No one.
No one. I promise.
No.
What?
That's what it cost, David.
Two hundred pounds.
Two hundred.
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
Yes. They're my friends.
Would you like to talk about it?
Are you all right?
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
Yes.
Just get on with it, Alex.
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
Why do you want a room here?
Oh, him. Well, he died.
Here?.
What guy that died?
What guy?
Hello.
And that's not the same thing?
You know about it?
A certain weakness.
No. But he needs treatment.
I'm a doctor.
No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
It's an improvement.
Did he sound upset?
No.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
Do you think you could answer that?
Writing seems easy.
No.
I see.
What's it about?
What do you do?
Would you like to see the rest?
Would you like to come in?
You must be Hugo.
The first one was fine.
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
What?
That sounds fine.
Sorry?
I suppose so.
Diseases.
Yes.
Same as everyone else.
No. I haven't seen them.
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
-- think what you have time to think, Lester.
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
-- is that what this is all about?
-- is that right?
You make me sick. Just be straight for once in your life.
We cannot go into this later.
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
Lester.
I just thought you'd like to know --
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
That's George.
That you were just indulging me.
Yes, but... I thought...
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
Why?
Maybe... why do you ask?
Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
Who?
Don't be silly. I'll just tell Lester we were smoking a couple of joints. See?
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
And who's Jill?
She what?
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
Right now, I just don't care.
No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
Hello, George.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
I hope she's all right.
Is she all right?
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
Yes.
Why don't you see Lester?
What about?
We have this political thing tonight. Could you comb me out at the house?
What're you doing later?
I can see that.
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
George --
-- to be put in that kind of position...
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
-- Numbers, and I don't need to place myself in that kind of position.
Nummers.
I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
I don't care.
I don't want to talk about it...
You're late, George.
I don't want to see you anymore.
You're very rude... if you don't come back --
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
It turned out to be cancer.
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
Gee, that's very serious...
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
What?
Why not?
Thanks a lot.
You mean that girl, don't you?
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
What're you looking for?
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
Shit.
God, I adore you.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
No. You know too many sick ladies.
Then it's not your problem.
Are you?
Are you in love with her?
Well, is she your girlfriend?
Like what?
You know what I'm talking about.
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
Want me to?
You going to answer it?
That headboard.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I am not!
I am not!
I am not like my mother!
Then what do you think?
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
You think that's funny, don't you?
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
I never get my hair done.
You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
Don't make conversation with me.
Why?
Making it with my mother?
Well, are you?
I asked you first.
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
Well, are you? Are you queer?
Did you hear me?
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
Chopped liver?
You're my mother's hairdresser?
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
Hungry?
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
You here to see my mother?
I don't know -- I've got to.
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
I can't just let him stand by the door...
God, there's Lester...
What?
What's that supposed to mean?
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
It's too late...
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
Well then what are you trying to do-
You're going to kill me.
That's it, then I'm leaving.
Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Lester's on his way.
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
-- you've got to leave.
-- well you better go after her.
Why?
-- we are?
What's wrong?
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
Me?
-- ass and legs --
-- but you never were much of a tit man --
-- very nice, very nice.
Nothing.
-- oh I thought you were --
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
We're friends.
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
He still having parties?
Where do you want to go?
I am you, you little bastard.
You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
You don't think so? I do.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
I don't know what gets into me.
-- gee...
Fuckin' A --
Who's the greatest cocksucker in the world? C'mon --
-- don't you want to --
-- why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you --
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.
What about it?
He's a director.
-- what guy?
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
What are you talking about?
Don't, don't, don't...
It'll ruin everything.
No! Don't! Please!
You're a genius.
George...
You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
You did, I know you did.
You did, didn't you?
Well, did you or didn't you?
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
You know what I'm talking about.
Did you?
George... how about Felicia?
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
George...
There was nothing to know. Anyway... if I can't have love I have to at least have money. I have to have some pride I can do something.
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
It was after you, baby. After you.
And what?
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
No.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
The shrink? Many times.
Not too much, don't cut too much.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
What's wrong?
... I don't get it done often.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
Jill's coming with us.
Okay... but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?
You don't seem very sure.
You would?
Well, what do you think?
Can't you do it out here?
Where do you want to do this?
Well, I do.
Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?
-- What for? Honey, I'll see you later.
-- Well no. It never came up.
He's a very private person, actually.
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
Jill's really great, isn't she?
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
Jesus...
So how's Norman?
I said you were a loser!
George...
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
Yes, yes, I did.
Stop it.
George, now cut this out.
Please!... that's not like you.
George...
-- yes.
I wish you'd go now.
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
... well I'm glad you told me.
I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
-- no, it'll help me, really --
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
I just want to know, that's all.
How many?
Obviously there were others, weren't there?
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
Who knows, I'm sure you don't -- but if it'll help any, I found it in your bed.
-- and take this with you.
I'd like you to leave now.
Yes.
Yes.
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
Let go of me.
I'm very tired, George.
What is.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Bullshit.
I don't want to fight, George.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
-- go ahead.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
Commercials.
Ha, ha.
Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here.
I know, honey.
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
What business meeting?
Never mind. Where've you been?
A friend dropped me off.
... Okay...
What?
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
When is that, George?
When is that?
When?
Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.
I want your feelings about it.
Your advice!
No, but I think they might.
Egypt.
Whether or not I'm going.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
When can I talk to you?
George.
I already said hello.
George.
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
Egypt!
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Could I?
Could I talk to you for a second?
How did it go at the bank?
Hello.
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
George.
Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated.
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
George?
Yeah.
You've never even been around one.
Maybe you don't even like children.
But in the same house, you know, one house.
Will we live together?
Why am I great?
Honey?
Do you really mean that?
I am?
I am?
What about me?
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
Honey, what happened?
How?
What?
Fine. How are you?
Now, George --
George --
George, I don't --
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
I just... who what?
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me.
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
Here in the canyon.
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
There were some shots.
Somebody's mother.
I was too old.
A daytime soap opera.
Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
-- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
You do?
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
-- you phony asshole --
Jackie Shawn.
You know what's wrong.
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Jesus, she's my best friend.
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Because I don't want one.
No.
Here.
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
Shut the door, shut the door!
Fine.
You're still jealous.
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
You and your touchy investors.
Really? How about starting with tonight?
That's not very logical, Lester.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him.
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
Steve?
Who do you think I was talking to?
I am?
No kidding? Your own shop?
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
Anyway, you're crazy.
Fine.
That's right.
Poster-Kleiser.
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
Hi, Leonard.
No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
What did you do?
-- He reached up and tore them.
Didn't you have any panties on?
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
... Mmm-hmmm.
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
-- uhh-huhh...
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
-- Yesss?
Well, there was this one time --
C'mon.
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
What?
Honey?
I would say so, yes.
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
It's been so long I don't how long?
Well yes -- you know that about George.
He does?
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
What?
Jackie --
How much?
I'm exaggerating.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
Well, you know what I mean.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Five times a day?
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
-- Yeah, honey...
But you have problems?
We don't think marriage is important.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
I thought you said things were great with George.
Well, it's George.
It must be something.
Nothing.
Well, what is it, honey?
-- No. No really.
You're really a love -- you sure?
Don't be silly.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
I guess not.
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
George is great but I know what you mean.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
I know, I'm sorry.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
So what's your point?
Well, he is.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I am? I mean why?
A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
Who is that?
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
You're kidding.
You're going?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
-- why?
Let's do that.
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
That bastard.
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
George? Was he alone?
Well... sure...
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
He's a hairdresser.
-- no.
-- never mind.
Johnny!
Sort of.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
Why don't you ask for another one?
Oh. thank you.
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
But why Egypt?
Egypt?
Thank you.
-- yes, Jill.
Jill.
-- there's not much room --
-- I'll get in the back --
Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
No!
No.
No.
No.
No, it's not that...
No... how long did you say?
Oh!
Danny!
Danny, come here!
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Are you having a bad dream?
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Danny?
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Yes?
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
It's so pretty.
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
And you're gonna lose.  And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right?
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
Okay.  You behave yourself.
Danny, come on over here.
Jack...
Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
Yeah, I know.  It always takes a little time to make new friends.
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Yeah.
Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.
Tony.
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
But eh what was the matter with him?
Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
Please...
Shall we go into the living room?
Sound good to you, Danny?
No, we don't mind.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
I'm a Wendy.
Nice to meet you.
I'm gonna go now.
I'll bring back a doctor.
Go away.
Go away.
Go away from me.
Get down.
Jack, stay away from me!
Stay away from me.
Stay... stay away!
Stop it!
Stay away from me.
Stay away from me!  Please...
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!
Stay away...!
Stay away from me,
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
I just want to go back to my room.
Stay away from me!
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Of course I am.
Jack...
Yes...
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
I don't know.
I can't really remember.
I...
Jack!
Jack...
Yes.
Yes.
Somebody did that to him.
He's still asleep.
And you didn't see anything at all?
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
Did you find anything?
No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
Yeah.  It's amazing how fast you get used to such a big place.  I tell you, when we first came up here, I thought it was kinda scarey.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
Any ideas yet?
It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
It's about eleven thirty.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
Yeah.
God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Just like a ghost ship, huh?
It's amazing how much activity is going on today.
Hi.
Thanks.
Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
Oh, I'll say.
Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
Oh!
Royalty?
Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Really?
Perhaps.
Well... thank you.
Oh?
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
Hurry, Sister!
This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
What is it, Mary?
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
Am I?
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
I know.  It's ancient.
Two days.  An hour or so.
Chops?
Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?
Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
You betcha.
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?
JUST SING!
You re okay -- for a civilian.
Van Cartier.
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
Is there any syrup?
She's a pro.
Again!
Amateurs 2
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
Tell me about it.
Wet behind the ears.
Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
I knew that.
Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.
You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
Soprano or alto?
Shirelles.
I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
Enough jabber.
HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
Mary Clarence!
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
Again?
Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?
The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?
Are you leaving us?
A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.
We're nuns!
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
I don't want to mess anyone up...
What?
Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
We could have been killed!  But you saved me!  Thank you, Mary Clarence!
What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
Oh my Lord!
Mary Clarence!
Mary Clarence!
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
I'm getting experience.
Who are all these people?
Really?
I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.
Experience!  Right?
We need experience.
Mary Clarence!
Are you sure?
Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
What?
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
You have to help me
A novice.
Three years.  Sister.
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
I... I brought you something.
I... I...
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
Come on, we're late.
Don't push it.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
I'm a Christian.
Oh?
Saving you.  Move!
Good day.
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
I must go where I can be of use.
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
You have a phone call.
The majority has spoken.
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church.  They command the utmost respect. Your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
Out of the question.
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the gold.
You're my Olympic event.
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
You have, I believe, some minimal background in music.  Therefore, you are to join our choir.
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence.  "No pain, no gain."
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?
We are nuns.  We seek solutions through prayer.
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?
Mary Clarence!
Come, Sister.
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead.
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
Your cell is more than adequate.
And whom would you call?
Useless distractions.
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
Your cell.  Your room.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
Yes.  Until breakfast.
No food.  Not until sundown.
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
Until sundown.
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
And the vow of chastity.
The vow of obedience.
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
Would you like that?
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
Check your driver's license.
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
And all those like you.
I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
It has come to pass.
Your cigarette -- out.
Miss Van Cartier.
Sit down.
I see.
The reason?
You were unhappy?
St. Anne's?
Very well.
Enough joking.
Your name?
What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
We can't leave it up to the Feds!
We've got to save her!
That should have tipped us.
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
We're losing it.
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
It should be here any minute.
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
Measles.
However, we can also pray for other things.
Peace on Earth.
All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.
Really...
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
I need to see you, at once.  Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments.  Mary Clarence?
Yes?
Sister Mary Patrick?
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
Yes, Mary Patrick?
Impossible.
Not a note.
Christy.
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
A Benedictine.
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
But how do we get there?
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
It's so beautiful...
She's our inspiration!
Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!
She wasn't a nun?
An... entertainer?
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
It's no use.  She just isn't here.
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
Ice cream!
It's brought people back to the church.
But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
It's better than springtime.
It's better than ice cream.
I'd rather sing than do anything!
He's kind.
He's decent.
He's not like other guys.
That was exciting!
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
Which convent was that, Sister?
Is this like your old convent?
Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet?  For final vows?
Yes?
Reverend Mother?
But where?
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
But... she was a showgirl.  She didn't have an old convent.
She said they were from her old convent.
Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
I don't understand.  Where is she?
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
I lied.
But, Bishop...
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.
I... I can't do this.
Quickly, close it.
Ichabod...
What was that?
The church.
Where are we going?
Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
If you think I am behind this, say it.
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
I have not been able to face him yet.
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
What is so urgent?
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
The skull is gone.
My God... what has happened?
What are you doing?
What did you say?
But, I am not alone, am I?  I only wished to see what you were up to, and...  To thank you.
I apologize if I worried you.
It is only me.
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
No, but... why do you ask that?
What?
What has happened?
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
What troubles you?
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
But, why?  Tell me why.
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
And this gives worth to butchery?
Must I hear this?
What are you on about?
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
Why would you do such a thing?
Won't they still have that justice?  Or, was it a vain promise?
People have put their trust in you.
You promised justice.
That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
I insist that you have it.
Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
You made this, and the drawings?
Yes, he does.  May I try?
It would be interesting to find out.
These scars.  How did you get them?
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
You are funny.
Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
He has proposed to me twice.
My suitor?
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk.
Other people?
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
Forgive me, I didn't know.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
Father saw you die.
You... you are alive.
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
I'll be back in a little bit then.
All right, y'all gonna go with me?
Would y'all like that?
It went real good.
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.
What do you want, hun?
Leave.
Leave.
Leave.
Leave.
That might be better than this.
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
Please Doyle, don't.
What?
He does make some funny noises.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
Frank, why don't you go off and play in your room if Doyle's gonna talk nasty.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
Huh?
I know he does.
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.
I'm glad of it, honey.
How come Karl won't eat here with us?
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
Nice to meet you, Karl.
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
We sure like havin' you.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
Yeah.
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
Well, okay. I got you some.
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
I believe you. I really do.
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
Okay.
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Right now?
I'll be dog.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
You scared me.
Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go?
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
I know.
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
Why won't he talk to women?
No, we have to get this story.
Do you smell shit?
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
Will he be supervised?
Where will he go?
I didn't mean that.
Is he leaving right this minute?
Signs?
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
That's really strange. What does it mean?
Before they were married?
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
No thank you.
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
Yes sir.
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
And what are you, his chaperone?
Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
An invitation?
No! At least I don't think I am!
What!
Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
I'd love to.
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
What happened?
Jesus, what happened to you?
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
American literature. What else?
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
I keep waiting for the next novel to come out. Anything in the works?
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
Will that be cash or charge?
Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
I can't believe it. Oh God, I can't believe it.  You're an angel, Auggie. An angel from heaven.
For keeps?
And you're giving it to me?
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
What's this?
Bully for you.
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
When I told her I was going to bring her father, she kind of melted. It's the first time Felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. She's dying to meet you, Auggie.
She looks just like you.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
I told her she was going to meet her father.
Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car.
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
It means "happiness."
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
You're looking good, Auggie.
Eighteen and a half years.
Henry told Cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again. When Henry makes a threat like that, people tend to take him seriously.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
I figured he had a right to know.
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
No thank you.
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
I just want to know where he is.
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
Is your name Paul Benjamin?
What are you talking about?
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
Aren't you going to say anything?
Well?
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
You're implying th...
It seems human.  To me.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
We discussed that.  And decided not to.
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
Closer to eight.
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
Happy for him.  And relieved.
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
It's not for the.  They only get to convict him.
Did you write that column?
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
Look at my face.  It's the face of the people who did that.  My father hardly speaks English.  We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
My mom.  Would be the problem.
We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
Easy.  Slow is best.
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
You like it?
And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
Yes.
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
I hope so.
I met one of them.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
Well, I'll come back later.
I guess she's not in here.
We don't have to run.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
Come on, Daphne.
Or was it Bryn Mawr?
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
I recognized him too - his picture was in Vanity Fair.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
You're so flat-chested.  Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
What do you think you're doing?
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
Thank you, Daphne.
I'm just going to get some ice.
And bring the cocktail shaker.
We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
When?
What's the surprise?
I may spill something.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
How's the bottle?
You all right?
You got some?
I have a very low resistance.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
What did you say?
Let me warm them a little.  There - isn't that better?
And you've got cold feet.
And your head is hot.
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
Anything wrong?
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
If there's anything I can do for you -
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
Good night, honey.
See you around, girls.
Are my seams straight?
I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
I'm Sugar Cane.
That's all right.  I was afraid it was Sweet Sue. You won't tell anybody, will you?
OH!
That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
I know.  Every time!
I told you - I'm not very bright.
How can I?  No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner.  I'll bring this back when it's empty.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
I don't know.  All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.
Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
I didn't do anything.  It just happened.
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
Yes, they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this?
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
You're not?
A merger?  How long will you be gone?
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
Tomorrow night?
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
Daphne has a beau - I have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you.
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
From a rich millionaire.
Really?
I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
Nice?  It was suicidally beautiful.
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Good morning.
Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
Mineral baths - now really!
Thank you.
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
Lets throw another log on the fire.
Well - ?
So inhale!
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax.
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
Anything this time?
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
Would you do me a favor?
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
Is that anything?
Have you ever tried American girls?
Is it that hopeless?
How can you think about food at a time like this?
You poor, poor boy.
Talk about sad.
Oh, no!
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
What happened?
You mean you can't fall in love?
That makes me feel just awful.
Nothing at all?
Have you tried?
You mean - like frigid?
What thing?
Harmless - how?
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
You mean we're alone on the boat?
What's on Thursdays?
Where's your shell collection?
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
Look at all that silverware.
Bon voyage.
I don't mind if I do.
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
What is it?
What a beautiful fish.
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
Oh - in here.
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
Love it.  Which way?
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Three?
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
It's sort of funny - you being out of gas - I mean, Shell Oil and everything -
It's the thought that counts.
Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.
Been waiting long?
Oh, Josephine - just imagine - me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio, on a millionaire's yacht.  If my mother could only see me now -
For me?  It's Shell Oil.
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
Because he said he's coming to hear us play - maybe.
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
Guess!
The most wonderful thing happened -
Josephine.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Well, I guess I'd better go -
Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
Shell Oil?
You collect shells?
Oh?
Why?
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
- and always the same Four Hundred.
- opening of the Opera -
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
Yeah.  Real hot.
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
How's the stock market?
That's very interesting.
I'm not interested at all.
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
Which one is yours - the big one?
You have a yacht?
Your view of what?
That must be it.
Your face is familiar.
Are you staying at the hotel?
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Who are you?
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
Why?
I don't think so.
My fault.
She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
What makes you so sure?
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
I wish they'd put us in the same room.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
Thanks, honey.
Would you mind terribly?
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
What's happened?
Happy days.
They get those weak eyes from reading - you know, all those long columns of tiny figures in the Wall Street Journal.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
I want mine to wear glasses.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Every time!
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
I'll say.
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
Have you ever been with a male band?
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
I'm not very bright, I guess.
Better keep a lookout.
Put it here.
All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught.  That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.
I play the ukulele.  And I sing too.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
Wow. You look beautiful.
Sure, disappear. Weve been walking away our whole lives.
Hey.
You practically bribed him with your erector set.
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
Are you sure youre okay?
What? Why? What do you mean?
But I do. I will. Youre my sister.
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
Pub Golf?
Why dont you get my half sister her seventh hole?
Drunk isnt the same thing as happy, Amy.
Christ, Amy.
Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
Except its Scotch.
Theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
She did?
Mom, please.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.
So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
Id be happy to. Youre welcome.
Sir, yes, sir!
Moms refining her strategy for DDay.
Huh?
My mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture. She thinks its--
Wheres Nick sleeping?
Im sorry?
Its the past. Its nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then lets go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning.  But not anymore.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
When we were together I was too here, now Im not here enough.
Is this supposed to be an apology?
Not for a dog.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
So, whats your point?
That was a long time ago.
Um, news flash: I dont give a shit.
Its called character. God, youre predictable.
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, were the past. Im not sure if you noticed, but Im here with someone else.
So, tell me, hows unmarried life?
Maybe not her least... Theres always--
Hey, you!
Hey, yourself.  I see youve met my ex.
Yeah?
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
Thank you.
What?! No, no. You cant--
Hi.
Youre right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. Its your job. Its who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
Youve always got that to hide behind, dont you? Its just business!
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
I didnt say he was worth it.
Yeah.
Spontaneously combust?
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
Desperation?
So, whyd you say yes to me?
You have had girlfriends?
Im sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
Oh, cut the crap!
But nothing did.
What?
And what if I didnt want you to...to do that to me?
So youre telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? Thats a down payment on a Ford Focus!
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
Are you sure?
Come on.
Show me.
Subtle?
Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda of escorts.
Okay.
This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
My sixth-grade science project was entitled, Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus. Trust me, Im careful.
I guess so.
What?!
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
And you thought Id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
You shit!
Oh, no.
Shampoo, got it!
If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
I have a friend at the magazine.
Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.
Sorry. Im a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
Not you. Youre not disgusting. Youre lovely. Just the idea that theyd bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didnt...who never.... I mean, someones dead.
I think thats disgusting.
A wedding.
Have you ever done anything like this before?
I do?
What is?
What?
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
Im desperate to start but I dont have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I cant get enough of.
That wont be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
Six thousand, right?
Im compulsive and weird?
No, count it, anyway.
What does your gut say?
What did he say exactly? I mean, you dont think he wants me back?
Of course he is. Im here with my new man.  I love it! Your magics already working. Let the suffering begin.
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé.
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?
Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in share. People do that.
I dont do naked. My sister? She does naked.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
Really?  Dont get too attached.
Yeah, but I feel like crap. And if you feel like crap, its way better to look hot while youre doing it.
Dont patronize me. Theyve clearly been at this a while.
You have feet?
Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like were trying too hard to look like we fit.  Its welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
Hi. Hey.
You knew?
Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
Therapist.
You didnt have to do that.
You have more than one gynecologist?
Of course, dont be silly.
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
I get all the glamour jobs.
Hey, Sal.
Yeah.
Its complicated, Dad.
Thats not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.
Meet Nick.
Dad!
Shes drunk. -er than me. But I didnt really dump you, did I?
I havent thought about that in years.
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
...but its getting there. 
Im worried. Amys not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it drunker or drunker-er?
Means you keep me using my head, and that's good!
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
And so you did your job, right?
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
You think about your father a lot, don't you?
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
You could? How?
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
Well, how did you like the class, David?
Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
And you're a tired little boy. I'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep.
Why don't you sit and I'll read you something he said.
Dr. William E. B. Dubois.
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.
Sure--
Colored.
That's where we came from first.
Here it is, right here.
They lived a long time ago -- before you and I were born.
That's right--
I try...
I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
That does it...
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
Let me see it...
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
Is he here in Borderdale?
You don't live around here, do you?
Can you swim?
Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
Go on...
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?
Be good and be smart, little boy.
What's wrong, Nathan?
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
What's wrong with him, David?
But who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field?
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
Who's Miss Johnson?
What's that you carryin'?
I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
Did you find your father?
Ask your daddy to give you some word about when he'll be comin' home -- and tell 'im we love him.
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
I wish you wouldn't take the dog with you, David -- he's likely to be a burden to you.
Good night...
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
No, I don't and I oughtn't not to after the way you've taken over since they took him away -- and I would like for you to see 'im so you can come back and tell me about 'im.  The field's all planted, so I guess I can spare you for a little while. When do you wanta leave?
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
Can't sleep?
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
Poor creature...
What is it, David Lee?
I think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot. I don't think he's dead -- just gone somewhere to heal himself.
Any sign of Sounder?
You sure can, son...
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
David, come back here!
Children, come here...
Same as we -- they pray.
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
When you get outta that school, you come right on back home, y'all gon' have to take this laundry work I done for Miss Boatwright today.
You got two shirts on?
Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.
Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
That's right!
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!
Might be...
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
Maybe soon--
Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.
Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
Tired.
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
I wanta get some things.
I brought these walnuts to trade.
But, Nathan--
Where you goin'!?
It's lunchtime, and I wanna have a talk with you, Nathan Lee. Come on, children...
I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
Is there something I can do to help you?
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
The most important thing is that you're home!  We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!
If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!
Little chilly.
You ready to eat?
Good mornin', Nathan.
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
And don't wake up Josie Mae and Earl!
Is that a blessing, Reverend?
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
Will they give him a trial?
I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
I wanta see Nathan.
What is it?!
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...
In that case, I accept.
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.
Marry you?
Except write our wills.
I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.
So close...
We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
We have room!  Let's go!
Sooner than later.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
So what's going to happen to you?
I'll do my best.
How does the distress signal look?
I'm about to blow the wall.
Barnes?
Taylor!  Where are you?
You too.
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
But how are you going to escape?
And what are you going to do?!
What?  What are you talking about?
Why?  Where are you going?
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
What's that?
Oh my God.  What happened?
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.
Helllp!
Words to live by.
Sure.
Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
What do you think's going to happen to us?
Taylor?
Explosive?
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
At this point I'm ready for anything.
Yeah.  We did it.
Ready as I'll ever be.
I understand.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
Wait.
Even if we do, it might be too late.
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
He certainly is polite.
We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
Why can't we?
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
OK...it's open.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
Just considering our options... sir.
Well maybe we can do something like that.
Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
What are we going to do?
Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Like open an airlock by mistake?
So you were looking for a new challenge.
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
That's right.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
So I've been told.
No, just enjoying the view.
Thank you.
I'm fine.
I'm going back for Taylor!
Carlo!
He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
Oh, a professional man. What'll you have?
You look like you're something on the lanes.
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
Junior who?
Who's there?
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
Don't go near the bowling alley.
You still got the touch Junior.
Leave him alone!
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
After we eat, Dad.
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
Can you change something this big?
Lips still for sale?
Very professional.
Suck my dick!
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
What about plan C?
I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Theo, Buzz is dead.
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
Why did you come back?
Can I come with you?
Where are you going?
Are you sure he's dead?
I feel sick.
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
Tell me what happened Theo.
Did you - kill him?
We would have sooner or later.
I told him you were my boyfriend.
It?
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
I can't tell you, Theo.
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
Nothing.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?
...lane six. Yes.
You're here.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
Come on, bargain with me.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
Do you talk with your mom?
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
Plan C...  ...is me.
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
What's plan B?
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
Why were you suspended?
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
We'll get into that later.
So, what about you?
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
No. Not at the present.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Can I ask you something personal?
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
Mind if I cut in?
It's a vicious cycle.
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
The mental hospital.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
Won't your father help you with that?
What do you want with my dad?
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
Mine, and they never tip.
Coming right up.
How do you want it?  The eggs.
Whips...orange whips.
Norman, please!  Don't!
Don't do it!
Norman, don't do it!
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
Don't do it, Norman!
That's our reserve air.
What was that?
Where is it?
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
But you've tested it?
High Voltage?
What do we use for defense?
What if it attacks?
What was that?
Nice work, Captain sir.
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
But she's --
Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
Yeah.  I heard you.
Two and a half days?
How long will that be?
Norman!
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
How about I just press the button?
Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up?
Hold on --
Would you wait a minute?
Wait a minute --
There's heat coming the door.
In basic English, what does all this mean?
How big is this spacecraft?
How's that?
Would it work?
Get away --
Get away from me!
You hear that?
What is that?  What are you doing?
Top shelf, is it?
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't fight me.
Leave me alone, Norman.
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
Don't you know?
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
You think I care?  You think I care if I die?  Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself?  Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not thinking about myself -- No, Norman, I'm thinking about you.  Your safety. Protecting you from your own self.
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
It's either this... or I kill you.
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
But I have to, Norman.
"It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It can't be.  I'm not doing anything." Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle.
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
Is it?
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
C'mon -- what?
Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
You think I manifested the snakes?
No, he can't.
No, he isn't.
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
Don't you?
You tell me.
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
I did do that, didn't I?
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
It's getting cold.
Are you?
What's wrong, Norman?
Oh yes, my watch.  I almost forgot.
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
How's Harry?
What do you mean, different?
In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
What is it, Norman?
You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
For what?
Only lab rats.  Here.
You ever given an injection before.
Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place.
To be on the safe side.  I mean --
It's an idea.
What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
How fast does it take effect?
I'll just boost the doses.
How long does it last?
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
Causes sleep.
It's a soporific.
How do you spell it?
Antibiotic.
Antihistamine.  For bites.
"... and may also cause bizarre halucinations".
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Nothing about drowsiness.
A synthetic opium analogue.
Ulcers.
It's for motion sickness.
Something for burns.
Why would Harry go back to using a code?
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
But why is he doing it?
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
How can the sphere do that?
But how?
You think, in the sphere --
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
What?
Manifested?
Squids?
What?
Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
You don't believe me.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
None of this was here before.
Wait a second --
That wasn't in there before.
The refridgerator.
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
You get it straightened out?
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
Still clear.
You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
What's the matter?
Still clear.
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
You don't trust me?
I fixed your suit.
I don't trust Harry to do it.
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
Maybe you should go.  To the sub.
Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
Don't bother me, Norman.
I have to reset the sub.
No, I should stay calm.  Like you say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm.
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
You bastard.
You did, didn't you?
You told him about me?
You said something to him, didn't you?
Don't tell me to calm down!
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
In Edmunds' things.
"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN."
Fuck you, Norman!  It's right here...
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
... He lied to us.  He left us down here.
Eggs.
Norman.
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
What?  Why...
Yeah, why?
What?
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
What about you?  What happened to you?
My gosh, Norman.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
The library.
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
Norman!
Good theory, Ted.
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
You're next, Norman.
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Because when we get down there --
Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
That's quite a secret.
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
I love secrets.
Who says it's a he?
Norman?  Where's Norman?
I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
I don't get it.
Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
We can refuse to talk.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
Like what?  I'm not --
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
What?
Just in time, too.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
What are you looking for?
Then what is it?
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
For whoever's in that thing.
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
Zander, no...!
Zander, what are you doing ?
Is it true ?
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
I don't know, Zander.
Yeah.
A funeral.
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
Excuse me...!
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
Funny...
So who's got time to get married ?
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
Zander, please... Let's go !
Johnny, wait...
Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
It looks like an... asteroid.
WHERE IS IT ?
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
You and me, huh ?
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
Hey, check it.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
Oh, I see... teamwork.
Or...?
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ?
Hey ! What are you doing here ?
Johnny, this is Zander.
Don't you have to finish the game ?
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
Are you alright ?
Which way ?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here.
...I'm sorry.
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
What's wrong with you ?
Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
You don't look very happy to see me.
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
Alright, I love you.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
You talk to Carl ?
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
Shhh...
You're right. Let's never stop...
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
Are you the boy for me ?
He's nothing like you.
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
Zander is going for pilot, too.
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
Good luck at the academy.
I'll meet you outside.
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
How do I know if this is love ?
Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
Johnny, my Dad's home today.
I thought you were going to help Carl.
You can't walk me home.
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
I don't want everyone to see.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Excuse me...!
Eeuch !
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
She's flying starships !
Your turn...
No way, ma'am !
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
Thank you, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am !
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group...
What frequency ?
I'm on it !
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
What ?
Well, excuse me, sir...
You used to dance...
C'mon...
Way to go, amigo !
That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
It stinks, you goin.
You got it.
High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
Flip six, three hole.
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
Guess you gotta go.
Sure.
How come we never got together ?
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
Too bad for her if she's not around.
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
Hut... hut !
You bet your life.
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Sure plan to.
I'll be there.
Then you'll be wet.
Nope.
Cal...
Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
I'll knit you a sweater.
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll <u>be</u> waiting.
What are you going to do?
...you think that's right...
Carla was in the car, right?
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
But that's what happened.
You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
What is it all about?
Lookit that, up already.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
Not without a rolltop desk.
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
Now you're talking...
Yes...
Oh yeah.
Sleep well?
People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
What?
That's something a man could do...?
Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
Did as of last week.
Press still works.
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...
...what...?
How's your star?
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
Yep.  N'it's for sale.  One of the few things money can buy.
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
No, that's true.
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
What?
Going home.
Hi.
That's right...
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
...yes.
...yes.
...he stuck a fishhook in it.
I hurt you?
How about, he sees her on the street, he wipes the soot from his eyes.  He goes up to her.  "What happened to the horse?" She looks at him.  She takes his hand...
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
What've you got?
What's the scene...
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
Go you Huskies!
Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
Sure did.
I used to go out with a politician.
So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
I do if you do.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
You can do it.
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Then I'll come back, then.
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
...because if you don't, they die...
Don't you think you should put them in water?
The other side.
Read the card.
You going to ask me in?
It's for your finger.
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
You have to sign for it.
"Room Service!"
Better'n new, cause it's got a <u>story</u>. Want to do the other part?
Better idea...
Paperclip?
Never saw the point of 'em.
...lost the screw...
What are you doing down there?
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
Cast stood me up.
That's for sure.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Hello.
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
Me?
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...
He doesn't go back to the <u>mill</u>, he gets a second chance to go back to the <u>firehouse</u>...
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
<u>Yes</u>...
Well, first, you got to change the title...
You bet your life.  "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
You'd know better'n me.
I love your script.
You're still here.
What are you doing?  I love your script.
Mister White is...
...who...?
Yes...
Mmm.
...I always thought so...
That's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...
Surest thing you know.
I live there.
Everyday things...yes.
That whole...
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
Goodbye.
Well.  It was a pleasure meeting you.
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
Of course.
As the Old Mill goes around...
I understand...
Yes...
No, no, I see...
Yes...
Yes.
Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.
You get what you pay for.
It was either that, or a sardine.
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
It's about life.
Yes.
It's in your play.
Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Why did you quit?
You quit.
I beg your pardon?
What's it called?
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
Who?
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
We got em.  North...No, Henry James was the novelist, Frank James was a criminal...  Yep, you came to the right place.  Jessie James was the <u>Brother</u>.  Of the novelist, that's right.  That's alright Susie.  See you tomorrow, Susie.
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.
I'm sorry.
He works on the movie.
I'm sorry.
It's all over between us.  I've found someone else.
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
I wasn't doing business.
I have to tell you something...
I've been thinking.
We did...?
Hi!
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."
That's so beautiful...
What are they offering?
Yes, that's right.
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
What is it, a surprise?
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
After Drama Group.
Water or mineral deposits.
Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here...
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
Morning, darling.
What're you doing here...?
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
We'll work it out...
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
I'm having dinner with W...
It's...
I loved it...he...
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
You have no right to...
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...
...we had a script conference...
Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...
I...
Oh.
Who is that...?
But we...
I like you, too.
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
<u>You</u> know...Where's your bathroom?
I love Jewish men.
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
I'm not a <u>child</u>... I have <u>feelings</u>... Don't you...don't, don't...don't...
You can't treat me like this.  I'm not a child!
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
Bob are you alright...?
Hello.
I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
He treated me as if I were a child...
...she has a <u>home</u>...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
The minute I read that script I said...
I'm only trying to...
I...
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
We, we have to give it.
Yes.
...yes...
Wally...
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
...I...
What?
...I can't do it, Wally...
I...I...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
Is...Is the Movie!
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
I can't do it, Walt.
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
I just...
She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now!
So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol...
Ben!  What's wrong?
I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
Good.  That's very good.
I'll miss you so much.
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
Yes.
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
Until he's old enough to read.
Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.
Let me be the judge of that.
I'm not.
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
Don't. Take me with you.
I don't want to say goodbye.
No, that never solves anything.  You talk like the big girl you are.  About what you feel.  And how he's hurt you. You know?  You tell the truth.
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
Nothing sweetheart.
Mom?  What's wrong?
Annabelle...wake up honey...
Maybe twenty.
How many devilled eggs can you eat?
Oh, yeh.
This'll work, huh?
This is a joke, right?
He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.
You have to ignore him.
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
And what do you do wh...
Good girl.
Not with my mouth open.
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
You don't like his friends.
Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
Actually.  I could only help him.
Great.
I could help with the debate.
A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
What's Thursd...
She is but an arriviste.
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
And...?
He wouldn't know.  <u>I</u> saw her in the shower!
...I'm not deaf, y'know.
I said...
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
I can't hear you.
Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
Secret's safe with me.
And don't tell her I told you.
I bet.
Actually.  She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.
She knows every neat junk food place.
Like a big sister.
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
I hope it's the right kind.
Well.  It's for you.
Wow.  Who's that for?
I'll be there for you.
That happens.  To families.
Like seeing the good side of Rachel. So she'll see the good side of us.
Like how?
But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.
Daddy and I tried hard.  We really did.
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
Look she's upset --
Or blush.  You look pale.
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
Then why are you putting on mascara?
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
What are you gonna talk about?
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
I like talking about it.  At least, to you.
So why are you asking me?
Because it feels really incredibly good.
...why do you think?
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
I live.  In the same country.
How would you know sh...
During sex.
Scream.
Why does Rachel scream?
Well, not exactly s...
Sex.  Of course.
Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about?
I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
I'm gonna call him.
Never say never you always say that. I'll bet daddy's mad at me now.
That will never happen.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
It happens.
It just slipped out.
Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
Like who?
Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
Mass hysteria.
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?
Excellent point.
I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.
Thank you.  Those were all words.  I hate the planet Uranus.  <u>Terrible</u> name for a planet.
I hate when you say that.
<u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling. Use your words.
I know you don't, but if you had, chrom- atically you <u>are</u> in the purple family.
I don't care.
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
A <u>suitable</u> boy, will be at <u>this</u> flagpole, <u>on</u> Monday, with a <u>very</u> expensive bike, and he will be a stone FOX if I have to call an <u>escort</u> service!
But Rache...
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
He'll be impressed.  The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
In high school.
Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?
Uh.  What is it?
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
Great.  Big ears, too?
Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
Help me here...
No, baby.  You're gonna use <u>my</u> words.
Not use my words, please!
And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.
That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be.  Now, just this once...
And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.
No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
...laughed, yeh.  They laughed real hard.
I <u>did</u> what she said.  I <u>used</u> my words, I <u>told</u> him what I <u>felt</u>, and they...
IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!
Oh, baby, I'm so sor...
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
No.  I think it's ugly.
You think this is funny?
You think this is funny?
That doesn't bother me.
That doesn't bother me.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Why don't you say hello?
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.
Honey, she won't d...
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
That's so weak.
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
She still packing for her trip?
See, I...
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.
MOMMY!
Your mom had to...help a friend with this...emergency?  And she called me. And we switched days.  Then, I got stuck on my shoot, and...
Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!
What if he's kidnapped?
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?
It's only one o'clock...Why don't you get another Fudgesicle -- I'll be done soon -- really soon.
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
Hold lunch!
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
The timing was off -- I need this light.
And this is my room so get out!
This is my house too!
This is my daddy's house --
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
Thank God for that!
I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.
Don't touch me!  I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!
I'm sorry, okay?  Let's not fi...
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
I'm almost done making it.  Alright Ben -- <u>you</u> deal with the tardy, <u>you</u> write yourself a note, your daddy <u>told</u> you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
Here.
No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.
Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!
You lost Ben?!
I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
You forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today.
Cos she loves you.
There's worse things.
YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
You owe me a quarter.
No they're not.
Don't take my picture!
I hate her.  I really hate her.
Ice cold water.
IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
'In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you... held you so ti-ight'...take it, man...
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
How could I be?  We learned some magic...
That's nice Ben.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
Mmmm!  Tasty.  You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Thank you Ben.  That was so sweet of you.  Goodnight Annabelle.  Sweet dreams.
Annabelle let's get something clear.
...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --  We are late.  We are seriously late.  Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed --
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
Alright starve.
Then have a donut --
Fine.
Fine!  Eat in the cupboard.
Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.
No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
Always.  Always.  And you won't hear a voice.  But in <u>here</u>.  You'll know.  What I'm saying.
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
Half.  Of him.
If a soldier loses his legs in a war.  Is he the same guy?  Sure he is.
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
Find the bird cage?
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
Okay.  These are good.
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
Ben where do you have to get to?
Where Ben?
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
I have cancer.  Do you know what that is?
Mommy's sick, guys.
Pray.  We never find out.
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
Thursday's fine...
I'm fine, ba...
That I do.  Always will.
Do me a favor?  Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay?  Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup.
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
What honey?
Yes...if you like big hair...
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that.
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.
I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
And when did that pass?
You say that like I don't know that.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
That's necessary, huh?
So we'll...radiate some more?
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
Duncan.  I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...
They're losing one mother.  They can't lose two.
Which part of no don't you understand?
I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...
It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...
Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
I live or I die.
Walk in the park.  And thanks for the 'we'.
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.
Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
It's temporary.
Stop.  You're making me insecure.
And we all went through that together?
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
WE are over.
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
To make it easier for them or you?
Just not to me.
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
And I'm supposed to care.
<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
Called him.  We set an ap...
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
Not to me.
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
Easy enough.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
I'm worried.
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
We're not discussing your age.
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
Something's up wi...
Because you don't really seem here.
Are you here?
Remarried.  There is no move.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
I have their past.
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
You'll learn.
You ride with Annabelle...
You're the hip and fresh.
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
What do I have that you don't?
With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
Uh.  You hate my guts?
Why didn't I?
He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
Ben never mentioned it.
I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
I lost him.  I was panicked.
You're lying.
Maybe I was wrong on that one.
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
And I have looked down the road. At what my life will be.  And I can't handle it.
No, there isn't.
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
Double.
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
Neutral ground.  What's up?
Thanks for coming out.
<u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u> it is.
You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.
And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
Well, that's what parenting is <u>about</u>, little girl.  They are <u>pleading</u> to know how they are supposed to do it. And you sure as hell <u>showed</u> her.
She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...
Shut the fuck up.  <u>I</u> didn't go behind <u>your</u> back.
Oh please.
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
Well, maybe <u>your</u> version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'.
You weren't passing 'em out.
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
That's not wh...
You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
Worked.  Like a charm.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
Aw.
You put filth in my child's mouth.
Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.
Give 'em my number.
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
Don't be too sure.
And I'm going to win.
Are we.
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
Looks nice enough to m...
Who in the world <u>is</u> he?
You really didn't have to come, you know.  I'd have brought them straight t...
He won't discuss it.  Just calls it history.
Is that what he told you?
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
And her...?
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.
Feeling the pressure?
My advice to you?  Don't die.
That's motherhood.  That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They <u>need</u> you to be happy.
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
It's the same choice you made.
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
You mean, after I'm dead?
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
It's just not the right time t...
No.
I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
...go to the park.  In the worst way.
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...
Thanks, but it's under control.
Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...
How's she doing with Brad?
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
What else?  Keep on keepin' on.
And you said...
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
The primo stuff is great for pain.
Brad Kovitsky.
You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
I really look like shit.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
So.  Hopeful.
It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
Can I look at the pictures?
Beats me.  Ask your mom.
And you said...?
Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
She's devastated.
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
Oh, my God.
Anyway.  He walks up to her on lunch yard today.  And tells her... publicly...that they're 'breaking up.'
...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
Moi?
She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
She hasn't mentioned this.
That.  And.  Annabelle is over her head.  With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky.
You're a cross-dresser.
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
Small world.
Ironic, huh?
Okay, I'm undeserving.
I have given them more<u>love</u> and more <u>care</u> every fifteen <u>minutes</u> of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty <u>years</u>!
See, I know that.
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
I don't, but...
How the hell would you know?
You bet you are.
You're not dying.
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
...it's my problem, too.
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
Luke.  Can't live like that.
Did I hear the word...
We can't live like that.
Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...
But I came here to...
Nobody likes a snoop.
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
Don't flatter yourself.
Look, you've never liked me...
You're taking the kids.  And moving to San Francisco.
You WHAT?
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
My boss.
I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
I don't know wh...
Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?
Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
Wowie.  How wonderful!
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
You feeling all right?
When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...
Yes?
Jackie?
She was angry at herself.
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
Anxiety.
What about obsessively picking her split ends?
No way.  I told her two, three years, maybe, for such an expens...
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
I'm sorry, I just...
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
Not personally.
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
Fine, forget it.
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
However many.  It's not enough.
What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
I did it for her.
So why did y...
Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
I need practice.
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
I didn't do it for you.  Believe me.
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
I have a snoop.
I don't recall inviting you.
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
...in.
A court <u>order</u> is gonna say that <u>woman</u> is <u>never</u> <u>alone</u> with my children!  Ever <u>again</u>!  Do you HEAR that?
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
Yeh?
Of all the <u>cheap</u> excuses.  To break a child's heart.
Look, I...
Machines do not EAT message.
You got to hell!
But it's not on the schedule!
Get out!
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
I was in there in him.
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
<u>Forgiveness?</u>  For <u>what</u>, exactly?
...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
What did you do?
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
Annabelle, how's your video rep...
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
We don't have any coffee.
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
I'm gonna get me a drink.
How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
Because you've changed so much.
'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing for me, Jack.  Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.  It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules.  When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
By way of saying you were unhappy.
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
Imagine my relief.  So what's for dinner?
Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.
Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
No problem.
I know that.
Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
It's just an assignment.
It's no biggie.
What's eight, ten years?  Hell, you'll still be ambulatory.  I think.
Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
I think so too...
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
You haven't done <u>one</u> goddam thing to make any of this easier...
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
Our weekend.  At that sweet little B &amp; B.
Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
You know I don't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot...your ex-wife's doing a bang up job and I have to face it every Tuesday and Thursday and every other goddamn weekend and I just don't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long!  Jesus what did you see in her?  I don't get it -- I just don't get it.
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
Look.  I know they hate me.
I know how responsible, caring adults parent children.  I'm bribe 'em.  But 'em a dog or something.  Maybe a Doberman.
But?  But what?
You don't trust me to be alone with them.
Can't handle them myself is what you mean.  Can't.
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
For what?
Jesus.
So I'll have to order in?
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
Well, it wasn't a reduction like you do it!  Boiling down half a ton of bones...
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
For rape and murder.
I know!
I am sure.
He wasn't.
Jesus was not bad.
Poison gas.
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
He's dead.
My grandchild-baby.
My baby.
My Jesus
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
Mi Jesusmi jesus
No.
This is work.
I'm always working.
No, Mikey.
I'm still poor.
We had to work. My family was poor.
I did not go to high school.
No.
It was God's will.
Four brothers and five sisters.
Yes.
Yes, Mikey?
What's an audience going to tell you?
We're not ready!
We're not ready.
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
This is definitely better.
The camerawork's nice.
No, you don't.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
You know he hated my story also.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
Oh. What happens now?
You mean, again?
Huh?
NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Fuck me hard!
Nigger.
...gger.
Ni...
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
Thanks.
Thank you for being honest.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
Can I join you?
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
What are you doing here?
OK. Bye.
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
Eight, six, and four.
Three.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. But not any more.
That's good.
Hunh.
I do.
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
That's good. So then what do you do now?
That's too bad.
Anything I might know about?
Oh, that's too bad.
I believe it.
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?
Yeah.
But...you called.
So what's going on?
Great!
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Who is this?
Hello?
Mm-hm.
Yeah, I guess.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
Yeah.
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
Intense.
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Sure, all the time, in Group.
Yeah.
Knock yourself out.
I don't anymore.
Um-hm.
Mn-hm.
We are?
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
You didn't get me in trouble.
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
Uh, home, you know.
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
Typical male.
Typical male.
Typical male.
Yes.
Responsibility, progress.
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Uh-huh.
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
Slides go with it.
What did you guys think?
Yeah!
Was it okay?
That was really great.
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Now?
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Right now?
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
Oh.
A cloud?
Oh. Well, what's it on?
What's it about?
Hey, you said you did a video?
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
Yeah, when's he coming?
No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
Really?
Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
Come on.
Hey, I'm Sooze.
Jeff! Let's go!
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If you're ever in L.A., you should come by the offices. I talked to Pony earlier. He said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs.
You better! Yes!
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
I'm so burnt-out.
Alright, Pony!
Buff is funny. God.
In what way?
Pony, what would you say our relationship is?
Am I fucking him?
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Sure I am. It's fun.
Oh, you were in the band?
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
I'm sorry.
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.
I know. It's okay.
That's what I mean.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
Deep down. Way down.
Erica.
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
Let's see.
You cut off your little finger?
Mm.
Really?
Mm-mm.
I'd like to.
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
Yeah. So, what about you?
A Porsche.
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
He is.
Yes.
Thinks he is. Well, he is.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
No, not really. Middle-class.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
Hi.
It's nice here. It's different.
Mm-mm.
It's coming along.
It does look good.
Pony and I are friends.
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
Hi, I'm Erica.
Hi.
I'd love to read that.
Mm.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
Oh, yeah, it was a great show.  You guys missed it.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
Oh, wow.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
You really suck, you know that?
What?
'Bye, Jeff.
You did, huh? Good for you.
You're unbelievable.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
I've run out of words.
Shit, Jeff!
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
For a ride.
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Is that a threat?
God, you smell like whiskey.
Mm.
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hm.
What?
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
Come on.
Jeff!
You do.
Yes, you do.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
Mm.
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
My goal is to make art.
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
New ground?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
So what do you wanna do?
Come with me.
Of course.
What feelings?
What?
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
Jeff. Jeff.
How?
Okay, what would you have done.
Oh, yeah?
It got that close.
It was a racial incident.
This is ridiculous!
Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him.
Um, because you didn't want to go.
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
Typical male.
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
What? What do you stand for?
But do you stand for anything?
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
I'm talking about idealism.
Your completely missing the point.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
Of course I do!
Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
About things that are important to me.
Yes, you asshole.
I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.
So you can give me more shit?
Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
It's a piece.
Man?
No.
No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
I hate that.
You could've come over.
What the fuck are you talking about?!
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
You know, my mom has this saying.
Oh, my god!
Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Me?
Yeah.
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
What's that supposed to mean?
Soon.
No, I'm going.
I'm moving.
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Jesus, Jeff.
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
That was so great!
Alright!
Yeah, come on, play it.
Yeah.
Oh, God, that would be something I really want to do.
Yeah?
Would I get paid?
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
You're not serious.
You do not want me to do your cover.
Yeah?
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.
You do not!
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
No, she was just sitting there?!
Like?
Yeah?
So? What's L.A. like?
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
Oh!
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Is that your driver?
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
Pony, oh my god!
Tim, go throw up somewhere.
Could you give me a ride?
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
Jeff!
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Leave him alone, Tim.
Come on, Jeff.
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Hey, Tim.
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
At least I have a point of view, you know?
Fuck.
The fuck not?
I'm going out later.
Well, use your head, "Stalker Betty."
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
Shut up, Cleo.  Di, how much do you need for an abortion?
Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
It's twins!!
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Cleo!
You just became a statistic!
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
Hello?
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
Wayne Gretzky.
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
She thinks you went to the police.
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.
Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee...
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.
Of course - of course!  Hands in...
But, we have to make a smart plan!
Well...
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
... I don't know.  Probably not.
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
No.
That's right.  So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.
And they get caught!
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?
Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
"Positive" you're sure I'm not fat or "positive" I'm...
Positive.
You sure?
Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
No...I've been pregnant.
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
Diane?  Diane!
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
That was gas, Sweetie.
Uh, Jack - look, I can explain...
If you reach for the stars, you're bound to get -- mm-Jack, pull over.
Mmm-hmmm...
I know, but that was before.
Jack, I think I should get a job.
Trix...
Jack...
Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.
Oh, Jack...
I sure do.
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
Hi, Jack.
...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.
Don't use big bills!
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Yeah, hold on.
That you?
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
He Ikea'd us.
Oh no...
Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
We were told you could "fix us up."
NO!  Wait...um...  We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!
Di, it's not your fault.  We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves.
It's all my fault.  I'm sorry I ever started this...
I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --
Kansas!
Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
Shut up.
And if the O.J. trial taught us anything, it taught us that in America, you can cut off someone's head and still be found innocent if you have enough money.  Your mom only shot a guy...
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day...
You sure I'm not fat?
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
He is the Great One...
Hat-trick?
We're here for you, Diane.
Madonna.
I'll just ask the question myself... "Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"
Nope.  Sounds more like the first.
Well, I want to know what happened --
Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Hello?
Yeah?
You're kidding.
Hey, hey, hey.  C'mon you guys.  Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow.  Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars.
Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
Ammo?
Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.
I guess there's an exception to every rule.
Hold on...
Ooops, hold on a sec.
Hannah, we've...
Hello?
That's okay, Hannah.  It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies.  Sex - you can learn from movies.  But robberies?  There's no way.
Or that!  Look, you guys, I just want to provide a future for my baby.  I know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand.  I could open that safe in my sleep!
And Hannah, you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises.
Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Thanks!  That'd be great.
Oh yeah, you caught us...
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Screw Lucy!
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
Definitely old.
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
Bank branch!
All of you!
Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.
'Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say "Fat-assed lesbian!"
You sure you wanna go there?
Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!
Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
Wait, Petunia.  Mommy's a little amped up - didn't get her yard time this morning.  Mink ain't my bitch.  She's a specialist... in banks.
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
My best friend got pregnant.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
Now how the hell can I help you?
Your help.
My what?
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
They could kill you.
I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
You shouldn't smoke so many of those.
Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
What the hell do you want?
Stop it!  This is crazy!
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
More proof God's a guy...
Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
I just think pictures should say a little something.
Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
It's from hunger.
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
If you love me, Joe.
Come on, Joe.
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
No.
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
Why did she call me?
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Whose?
Whose house is it?
This is where you live?
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
You did.
Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
I don't want it now.
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
I just don't.
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
Was I?  I'm sorry.
Twenty-two.
It must be my new shampoo.
If you please.
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
Who's Norma?
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
It will?
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
Oh, you --
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
You're tough, all right.
Nobody can be that busy.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
We're engaged.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
I'll make it short.
Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
Why should you do that?
Well, for heaven's sake!
You sure have.
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.
I tell you this is half sold.
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck.  They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.
He thinks it could be made into something.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
With a wildly beating heart.
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
Phillip, you're mad!
Are you hungry?
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
As for instance?
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ...
I didn't.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
I've been hoping to run into you.
You forgot this.
Hurt feelings department.
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
Hello, Mr. deMille.
But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
It's a good script, isn't it?
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
No one leaves a star.  That makes one a star.
I'm the greatest star of them all.
You heard him.  I'm a star!
That isn't true! Max?
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
Wanted what?
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
That's a lie!  They still want me!
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
You think I made that up about the gun...
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?
Of course you haven't.  I wouldn't let you.
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
No you didn't.  You took the car.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
You'd better get to bed yourself.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book.
He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
Thank you, darling.
Don't you want to come along, darling?
I know that trick! He wants to belittle me.  He's trying to get my price down.  I've waited twenty years for this call.  Now Mr. deMille can wait till I'm good and ready.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
All right.  Give me this.  I need it for a moustache.  Now close your eyes.
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?
Where are my cigarettes?
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
You're a darling.
They're awful.  They make me cough.
So he said it quite a few years ago.  So what?  I never looked better in my life.  Do you know why?  Because I've never been as happy in my life.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.
This is the right day.
I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.
Great stars have great pride.
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
Go away.
What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you.  Is that it?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
What's the matter with you?
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
"Mad about the boy."
I'm in love with you.  Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along.
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
You think this is all very funny.
Hold me tighter.
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
Who?
Don't bend back like that.
Just follow me.
Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Come here!
Come on!
Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!
You'll need them for parties. You'll need them for New Year's Eve.  Where are your evening clothes?
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
How about some evening clothes?
Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
Now you're being silly.  We don't need two cars.  We have a car.  And not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit.  An Isotta-Fraschini.  Have you ever heard of Isotta-Fraschinis?  All hand-made.  Cost me twenty-eight thousand dollars.
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
Cut away from me?
What scene?
What's that?
Suppose you make up your mind. Do you want this job or don't you?
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
You'll like it here.
I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
You can stay here.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
Where do you live?
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
I don't care.
I want you to do this work.
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
What month?
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
I will not have it butchered.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
I wrote that with my heart.
Of course it is.
Well?
I am not afraid.  Read it!
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Who else ?
We've made a lot of pictures together.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.  I ought to have it taken out.
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
Are you or aren't you?
You're a writer, you said.
Just a minute, you!
Get out!
You are! Writing words, words! You've made a rope of words and strangled this businessl But there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles, and Technicolor to photograph the red, swollen tongue!
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
Or shall I call my servant?
Get out.
It is not.  Get out.
How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
What is the scene? Where am I?
They have?  Thank you, Max.  Tell Mr. DeMille I will be on the set at once.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
Thank you, Max.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
Who?
You know better than to interrupt me.
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
Bring something to drink.
What do you mean we?
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
At last. Ultimate Power.
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
I don't feel like it right now.
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
Home?
Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on.
Whatever you say.
I think I'd better keep it.
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.
What do I do?  I don't know her name.
That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one.
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
Am I? Still?
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
Eliminate her.
Why did she have to show up now?
No, a super girl.
A Storm Dragon?
It's what we were warned about.
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
Have fun.
He will be. In about five minutes.
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
Sorry, mistress.
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention.
But which one?
It must be the girls. One of the girls.
Softball.
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
What does it mean?
The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.
What is it?
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
What do you want?
Do you want to come to Argo City?
I'll come back as soon as I can.
How do I fight it?
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
And you can see how you feel about me, right?
What?
You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
Are you asking me for a "date"?
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
I don't see why not.
And now?
Miss what?
It seemed that way to me.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
But I don't understand.
I sort of like what you said.
But why?
Just like that?
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
Is this how?
Well...I guess one is all right.
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
No.
What's that?
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
All this talk about love, it's silly.
We're from different worlds.
We can't do that.
But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
Tell me where I can find her.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Yes. It reminds me of home.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
We have to have a long talk about all this.
You love me?
Who didn't?
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
I have to.
Later.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
It's for your own protection.
Well thanks a pile, fella.
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
Hey! Ethan!
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Guess! Go on.
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
I could force you.
I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
Come back to my house. My car's outside.
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
And you think you're in love.
What an adorable hat.
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
A passionfruit smoothee.
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
I bet they do.
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
Finished your estimate?
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
I've got things to do.
George---I thought you'd never ask.
Why George, are you proposing?
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
Yes.
Someone's chasing him.
Oh, no thanks.
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
Theories?
Nice to meet you.
You're supposed to guess.
You bet your ass.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
I can't help it if men notice me.
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming.
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!
He's nice.
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
Somebody's gotta do something!!
Lucy; come back!
I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
Why is he acting so strangely?
Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?
It doesn't seem right.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
You sure?
No thanks. You go on.
It was just a trim.
Your hair looks the same.
She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
But what for?
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
Must've been a defective puck.
How'd you do that?
She's a beast.
She did that deliberately.
Thank you. You're very kind.
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
You're not...an orphan are you?
I'd rather not talk about it.
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
This is all your clothes?
There isn't any.
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
I can do that.
Sure. Mate in five moves.
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
I'd love to.
No, MR. Danvers.
I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
I'm Linda Lee.
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
Nonsense.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
I could teach you a thing or two now.
You're wasting your breath.
Nigel, get lost.
Throw him out.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
I just did. Because I have the Power.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
That's home.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
Where is inner space?
Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
What's it like?
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
For what?
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
Not yet.
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
Cheap but effective.
A cheap trick.
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
I don't scare that easily.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
Who are you ?
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
That was meant for me!
Zaltar!
Zaltar. Use the wand!
It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Better than when I was a child.
I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart.
You're going to take me back?
Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
Then come with me.
Then teach me how.
Why?
I knew it!
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.
Zaltar, please help me.
That horrible woman!
You look at them? How?
But what about other people? Don't you miss them?
Are you happy, Zaltar?
It's lovely. . .
Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
Others?
I know.
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
I was on Earth...
What is this place?
Anyday...
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
Well, aren't you excited?
He really was!
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that.  Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher.
I can never get a way from it.
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
Pate? What pate?  I didn't make any --  Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
Peanut butter and jelly.
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
I mean him.
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
I just can't stand this.
I thought "Clark Kent has a really nice voice." You didn't even know I was there.
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
You...um...you never got married?
Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
You know what's the problem?
There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"
For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
You look wonderful.
Clark.
Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
Sister! I'm his sister!
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
But the bridge...
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
Thank ...you.
Ricky?  Where...what...
I can't! It's out of control!
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
Superman. The boy you left behind.
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
Where do you usually find a light switch?
Turn on the light.
"At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
How would you know?
Energy! And when they say "Energy" what do they mean? Nuclear? too dangerous. Solar?? Too underdeveloped.
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
Yes! This time we got it right!
Don't bet on it!
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
Who needs Gus?
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
We can get to work on that oil!
A normal person.
So?
Where did it come from?
What's wrong?
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
Don't cry, Bubba.
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
Small potatoes.
Today coffee----
Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
She's not his mama either.
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
Blizzards! Heat waves!
It could make weather!
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
I don't kiss.
That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
Everything on it.
Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
. . . Superman?. . . . .
I'm fine. . . . . .  What  was I talking about?  Before?
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?
Never closed my eyes.
Oh, hi.
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
Let's get you inside . . . .
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
I want to.
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
I'm listening.
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
Maybe you wanted to.
I was right. you are Superman.
It's true. It's true.
Oh Clark, no!
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
Where were you?
Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold.
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
In July???
Of course, that's what friends are for.
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
Be my guest.
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
But him is you.  Now I'm confused.
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its --
Superman! The --
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
You know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright blue eyes and square. Men who like to dance slow, the old fashioned way, the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
Clark. . . !
I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
. . . Let me get my purse.
Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic.
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
What about here?
That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
You're late. Very late.
Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
That's just it! You don't have to flaunt it. You're no slave to fashion ... although ...
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
Stuff it.
Daddy . . . ?
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
What's that?
What's he going to say?
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
I think there's an angle.
Superman gets mail here?
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
I think he's kind of cute.
Is he for real?
Yes, but I'm the only one who knows him. I  --  I really like the guy. And he likes me.  I think. I mean, I could talk to him, you know? And he could talk to me.  Anytime...
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
Of this...Superman.
You're just jealous.
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
There weren't any wires. I looked.
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
It wasn't a trick!
I'm telling you, I was there.
Not unless you can fly.
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
Big night coming up?
What now, my love?
You described the exact contents of my purse.
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
Oh, for God's sake!
Stop him, Clark!
Hey!
Not in Metropolis it isn't. This is the home of the sneak attack, the stab in the back, the --
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
'Swell.' When  was the last time I heard anybody say  -  where are you from , anyway?
Some people aren't the athletic type.
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
Are there any more at home like you?
Not...gray.
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
Your bookie?
Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
Well!
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
Oh.
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
Screaming
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
You can't do this to me!
I mean the other one!
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
Tea?
What are you going to do to him?
Oh. Why? does he live up here?
I didn't bring any  --
This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
I don't understand.
A night on the town instead of under it?
I know...
I knew you'd hit me.
You're not going to hit me?
There was a recipe on the back  --
You?! How about me?
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --
Ready.
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
We just take it?
You're not going to tell us why you're happy, are you?
You're happy, aren't you?
I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
Meteorites!
Mr. Romance...
I'm going to bed.
See?
I read the article.
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
I didn't say a word.
Bet he makes it.
Tough guy, huh?
You think he's for real?
Again???
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
Even that would be an improvement.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
So I've noticed.
This??
Your father was a sick weirdo.
Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
You and your real estate.
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
Gets you where you live, huh?
'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.'
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
He is. Usually.
Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
Okay, but...why?  No offense.
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
Where do you hail from?
Do you like pink?
Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
What color underwear am I wearing?
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Can you really see through anything?
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
How much do you weigh?
How old are you?
It must feel great.
Oh.
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually, he's a bit dull, if you know what I mean.
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Well...flashlight?
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
Wha'...what are you doing here?
Superman???
With my luck, now it'll rain.
Who...who...
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
You've got me? Who's got you???
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
Oh.  Right.
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
I don't know.
It just seems...kind of weird.
Are you sure?
Okay.
Was it good?
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
Why did you do that, Billy?
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
Because I have to.
I have to.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
Good night, Billy.
You're leaving.
Just like we look forward to this.
They can look forward to that.
Your kids never cry.
Yes.
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
When the game's over, I guess.
No.  It should be dry by now.
Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking.
Have you been waiting long?
Can't you make it later?
Billy, that's too early.
I don't know.  But it was weird in terms of what happened next.  Sean was still watching his mother.
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.
Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
Anything you didn't understand?
You heard what Abbott said?
Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling?
What other people?
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
You've talked to Billy?
Billy said that?
He knows that?  Billy?
Because I'd be to blame, right?
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
The Walkers loved Sean.  He was their only child...the object of all their attention.  I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man.  That's his nature.  But Risa, she's still got dreams.
What do you mean?
That's right.
What do you mean?
A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.
With our hands.
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
Yes.  Like I was putting them into my big basket.  Clearing the hillside of its children.
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
No.  I saw it on his face.
No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
From what?
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.

Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
Oh yes.  Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school.  It's like he was their little treasure.  He was such a beautiful boy.  That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott.
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
About the Ottos?
Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.
The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
I'll just strap it on the roof.
I didn't say that.
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.
It's the truth.
No.  What's this lawyer business?
Who's Mr. Stephens?
From you?
Is this mine?
I feel like a princess.
It's interesting.
How was it?
And winter?
What happened to summer?
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.
Should I keep reading?
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
Yes.
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
That's right.
What, Mason?
Okay.
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
Yes.
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
It's like a song.
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
It was snowing.
Why?
Dolores.
You seem very sure about that.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
I won't lie.
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
Yes.  Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long.  Then you start to feel...unlucky.
I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...
No.
Wanda does these photographic things.  That's one of her pictures on the wall.
Crafts.
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
Yes.
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
There's the Prescots...
What do you mean?
...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
She...she was a friend of mine.
Will you be spending more than a night?
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
No.
Yes.
I told you I was positive.  The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
Positive.
Seventy-two miles an hour.
Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
Dolores was driving too fast.
Yes, I understand.
I was scared.
Before the actual accident?
Yes.
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
Yes.
As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
Yes.
No.
Until the accident?  No.  Yes, there was.
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
Yes.
Like what?  I mean, I don't remember a lot.
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Yes.
Someplace where no one knows her.  Someplace strange and new.
She'll move away.
Will the police do anything to her?
What's going to happen to Dolores?
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
Great.
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.
I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?
Great.
No.
As opposed to this T.V.?
Nothing.
How will he do that?
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
But you didn't lose me.
My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
You and Mom have a lawyer?
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.
The door needs a lock.
It's okay.
Very slick.
The ramp?
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
Nothing.
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
You mean it?
Really?
You don't know that.
The Ottos.
But Charlene...
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!
No.  I'm going home.
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
No...
J.J., Steve isn't...
When I'm certain, I'll let you know...
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
I said Sidney!...
Sidney is a liar!
Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him.  And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! HUNSECKER  I'm not fighting with you, puss...
Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...
History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
No, I'm not.  I'm not!
Did Sidney tell you about it?
Why?
- that's what I mean!
What would you think of me if -
A girl needs a little romancing before she -
This sort of thing!
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
Back?
Hello.
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
In his apartment -
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
At the bar - Sidney...
Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
I don't think so.
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.
If you want me to -
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...
I know you do, Sidney.
Yes.
Nothing...
Take a top coat.
I'm used to you...
Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
I hate to see you like this --
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?
The renting agent and the tailor.
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
But...
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
That's the third time he's called today.
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
Like you?
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.
I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
Yes, but why?
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...
You are saying goodbye, aren't you...?
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
Steve, I...
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?
Would you buy me a cup of coffee? In there...
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
Steve, stop it please...
I made you write a beautiful song...
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
If the stores are open -
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted.  He isn't perfect, but -
I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
Those lying motherfuckers!
What chip?
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
John, get out of the way!!
Ready.
Go!  I'll finish here.
Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
I love you, John.  I always have.
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
We're better off by ourselves.
It, John.  Not him.  It.
Out of the way, John!
Kyle, don't go!
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
I know!
They took him from me.
Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!
There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
Are you afraid?
It's finally over.
Is it safe for them here?
Can you get us in there, past security?
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
Why attack Russia?
And Skynet fights back.
Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
Then what?
Why him?
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
You look like handmade shit.
Can it be destroyed?
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
What does he mean, too correct?
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
And no elbows on the table!
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
That's because you had a proper upbringing.
I would like to go now, please.
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
I can't do this. It's not right.
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
Of course.
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
Major, Major... he's here ...
I'm sorry.
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwängler?
No. Ours was damaged.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
Three months.
Yes.
Yes.
I won't let the fat kid down.
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
Alright!
Thanks, Chuck.  I need the money.  Can I still work the hours around my classes?
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Aren't I worth waiting for?
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
Yes, Chuck?
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.

I thought you did.
I hate the beige one.
You're a big help.
What do you think?
I'll do the same for you sometime.
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
What's it to ya?
Aha!  Is she young?
You must have a girlfriend.
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
What are you doing?
We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
You're not supposed to.
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
I bet you're ticklish.
Kyle...
Oh, Kyle.
And so you feel nothing.
So much pain.
A girl.  You know.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
Don't say that.
He'll find us, won't he?
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
I want it to be over for you.
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
You must have had a fun child-
What's that?
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
Kyle?
Fuck you!  Let go of me!
Listen.  Understand.  I'm not a military objective, Reese.  I'm a person... You don't own me.
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
That's where we're going.
Thanks a lot.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
About where you're from.
Okay.  Talk some more.
You like it?  It's my first.
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.
You volunteered?
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
What's he like?
Just talk.  Tell me about my son.  Is he tall?
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it.
We gotta get you to a doctor.
Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
Reese...you got a first name?
Freezing.
The what?
I don't understand...
Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
Just let me go.
And you're from the future too?
So, it's from the future, is that right?
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
Okay.
I can't sleep.
I guess so.  You're a doctor?
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Then, you kiss his ass.
Always.
No.
Yes.
Julliard, yeah.
One brother, one sister.
Originally, Connecticut.
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
I have to get to the airport...
Claire.
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
I have to show you...
Please, Nicholas, let me show you...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
Let me show you...
Nicholas...
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Listen very carefully, I'm telling the truth... this is the game.  This was all the game.
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...
Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
We searched the house.
Where'd you get that gun?
That gun.  That... that's not automatic.  The guard had an automatic...
Where'd you get that... ?
They won't...
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
How deluded can you be?  There's no <u>why</u>...
What do you think you're doing?
Nicholas...
Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
It's out of your hands.
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
Who is it?
Who is it?
I don't know.  A lot.
What?
All I mean is... someone like you...
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...
What did you say?
They don't care about you anymore. Alive or dead is the same, as long as they bury you deep enough.
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
They did the same to him as they did to you.
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.
Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember?  I was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game.
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
You don't have a choice.  No one else is going to tell you what's going on.
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
What are you doing... ?
God, wake up, it's a con!
Nicholas...
Not here!  They can see.
They're watching.
I don't...
What's wrong?
Yeah.  First Communion.  Aren't I a little angel?
Want anything to drink?
Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
Okay.
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
Where'd you get this?
What is it?
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
It's okay, dad.
What are you doing here?
They said five hundred.  I said six. They said the man in the gray flannel suit.  I think I said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
Right.  Call me Christy.
I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
Nice.
What exactly do you do?
Where are we going?
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
That's classic.
Nicholas Van Orton?  What are you, a czar?
Never did catch your name.
... two hundred dollars a toe.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
They'll love that.
What's C.R.S.?
I'll wait.
My hero.  Let's go.
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
No.
You pull me up.
You first.
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
If there was one.
Why not?
Never mind.
How thoughtful.  The gift of inconvenience.
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
Home.
See you around.
There's got to be a flashlight.
You should be.
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
What are you talking about?
A game?
What... is... happening... ?
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
What <u>is</u> your problem?
He's turning blue!
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
Don't just stand there, get help!
Do you know what to do?
What's with him?
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
What are you babbling about, psycho?
Oh, no... you.
I said I was sorry...
It was an accident.
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
I'm so sorry.
Goodnight.  See you home.
Nobody worried about your father.
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
Not much, I think.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
What makes you ask?
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
Mr. Van Orton... ?
Goodnight then.
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
Is everything alright?
Well... send my love, if you see him again.
You did?  How is he?
Dinner's in the oven.
Have a nice day.
Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
I only saw Theo drive up.
Well, I... uh...
Uh... Nell Vance...
Nell!
Was sure she'd be in here.
Nell --
Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
Maybe someday.
Yeah.
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
No.
You could have.
He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
Luke.
And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
No --
My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her.
Then who called me?
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.
Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  Because that's where their bones are!  He killed <i>hundreds</i>.  He took them here and he killed them.  Their bones are in the fireplace!
It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?
It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
Why?
Sure.
Welcome Home.
It was a stupid thing to do.
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
Are you coming to confess?
I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
I got more scared.
Yes.
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
It was very specific.
That smell... oh, God.
Sorry.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
All the carvings.
Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
But the experiment was a failure.
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
Oh God, we can't get out!
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
She needs help.
Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
How could you do this to people?
It's okay... we're all here...
Maybe they're Mary's.
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
When do we take the tests?
No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
Why?
Yes.
Why?
Who?
Is there something about the house?
Why do you need a chain like that?
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Oh!  You scared me.
No one will come any nearer than that.
Why would we --
Well, I've never lived with beauty.  You must love working here.
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
Mrs. Dudley.
Then let's go get you one.
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
Just had to be sure.
What'd you come back for, babe?
Come on!  Why are we waiting?
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
I do.
I don't think I want any.
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.
-- but the painting!
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
Nell, what happened?
Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
-- What do you think?
Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> --  -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --
Okay.
I think so.
Are you sure?
I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?
I don't know, you know...
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
I have a loft.
I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
Red.  What else?
Well?
I've never had a pedicure before.
Just think about one thing right now: What color?
I don't know what to think anymore.
Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.
Before he painted your name over Mister Crain.
There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
That's so sad.
I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
Why?
Maybe you did it yourself.
Theo... Did you?
No, it's getting worse.
Is it over?
Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
David?
David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
David.
What's his first name?
Watts?
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
How could he have left without his keys?
I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
Good night, Theo.
No.  The world has missed you.
Yes.  I've missed it.
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
You're okay.
I love this house.  I really love this house.
I know.
Jeez.
I don't have anyone.  But I do have a little apartment of my own.  It has a little flower garden.  You can just see the ocean.  At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor.
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
No.
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
Not really.
That depends.
I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
What do you do?
That's why we're here.
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
I don't know what you mean.
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
It's all I could afford.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
Fifteen dollars.
What did it cost?
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
Why not?
We think?
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
It must've been a time.  A golden moment.
I like the colors.
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
Italian.
Italian?
Oh, god.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
Like you.
Why?
What kind of food?
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
It's not a knock.
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
Well, you're certainly not a person.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
Is that a problem?
Then what good is he?
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
Hard to miss.
No, but I know what he means.
You just cooking then?
Well, those are the breaks.
Really.
Probably.
Uh-huh.
Not much -- you?
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
Poor baby.
Friends and <u>colleagues</u>.
How do you know?
What's in Big Sur?
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
Up the coast.
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
Won't he be looking for you about now?
I guess you're just habitual.
What'd your father do?
He alive to see this?
What about your grandmother?
Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
Only in the movies.
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
Pushing the legal limit even then.
I don't believe it.
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
Overnight.  What about just now?
Who remembers.
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
It didn't discourage you, though.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's."  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.
You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid.  But she never turned up.  I called the house but only got the answer machine.  When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming <u>straight</u> to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she just wanted to drive.
Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
There's the phone.  You want his number.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
Are you serious.
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
-- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
Right.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
I bet.
I see.
What line is he in.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
-- Your employer?
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
That's what was estimated.
Where you get your bank statements.
What's that, like a P.O. box.
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
I might've been away for the weekend.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
When did you get in?
She was happy here.  However the two of you might have parted.  Don't think she wasn't.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
Modelling.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
Disappointed.
Not ashamed.
Not embarrassed.
I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  It must've been the bars.
Now who's being sarcastic?
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Try calling me again.
Well, that kind of security can't be bought.  Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
That's not what I heard.
It's been a while.
Been busy, have you.
No, why did you come here?
Why did you come here?
Not her brand.
You look alike.
Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--
It's OK...
...I wanted to make you happy.
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
You're an enthusiast.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
But more or less.
...I stank, didn't I?
Geez, Mr Crane.
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
Oh, Mr Crane--
Boy.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
That's what he keeps telling me.
Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
We've certainly missed you.
We haven't seen you since... I'm terribly sorry.
Hello, Mr Crane.
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
Hi, Mr Crane.
Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow.
He was deaf when he wrote this.
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.
I knew we'd pay for it.
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
Should I... should I tell you why?
I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
I don't know what's going on. I--
Honey.
It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries, I'm sure.
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
...What's so damn strange about that?
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
Ahh...
Dave.
...What a knucklehead.
Oh, don't be a grump.
Come on, get ready. It's important.
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Honey?
Dr. Frock?
We will.
No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes.
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
What's that?
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?
I think so.
What's going on?
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
But a virus normally codes for other viruses.  This one's making human and animal proteins.  Listen to this.  "Glycotetraglycine collagenoid. Weinstein's tropic hormone.  4- monoxytocin supressin hormone."
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
What are they?
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
What is it?
A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
I'm not giving up.
Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
I don't believe it.
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Yes, I do.
Okay.
How about lunch?
Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
Yes.  Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant.  When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach.  The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
What kind of hormones?
It's reptilian.
There's another possibility.  A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
Mbwun.
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
That's impossible.
What?
I have the species identification on these teeth.  We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  Call Dr. Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.
But at what a price.
I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?
I can't!
Do it, quickly.  Please.  Aim for the eye.
Just like John.  He won't listen.
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
That thing is John Whittlesley.  I should have seen it before!  The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA!  He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states.  He probably entered the country as a man.  It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum!
No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you were right.  It's John!
Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
You smell that?
Help someone!
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
The answer's right in front of us.
We have to try and draw it off!
I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
I think... it means it's full.
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
What is it doing?
What are you going to do?
Is there another way around?
The planetarium!
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
That would fit.  It's nocturnal. Quick.  Come inside.
Wounded?
You're not.  Where is it?
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
That's not what I saw.
Behind me.  Over there.
It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.
You were behind me?  Running after me?
I don't know.
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
I don't understand.
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
No one knows.  The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
How did you know that?
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --
I don't understand.
And John?
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
--Truman, you're gonna be late!
Truman, stop it!
You're the one talking to the walls!
Do something...
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
I've tasted other cocoas.  This is the best.
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
That's not true.
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.
So we just eat into our savings, is that the idea?  I'd better call your mother when we get there.  She'll be worried sick - I don't know how she's going to take this.
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
Truman, what about that sign?
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
There's been an accident, Truman.
Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
Truman, that was our house!
You blaming me for the traffic?
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
So why do you want to go?
You hate gambling.
What?!
You're upset because you want to go to Fiji.  Is that it?
--we need more charcoal.
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.  I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me--
Put some butter on it--or ice?
I don't know--
Oh, my God!
Surgery.  The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night.  Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors.  Non-union contractors.  Monsters.  We're starting with an amputation.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
See you in a minute, sweetheart.
I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough?
I made macaroni.
Your mother called.  You shouldn't upset her like that.
I know.
What're you doing down here?
This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this now and then.  Come to bed.
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, Truman. There's the car payments.  Are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations?
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
Every time you and Marlon--
Oh, God.
Where have you been?
Did something happen today?
I was hoping we could have a special evening.
A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on.
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
Well, what do you think?
It's a surprise.
Truman, you're gonna be late!
Well, we're FBI agents.
I think you better tell us.
You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
Do you live around here?
No, they don't.
What is it you find incredible?
Agent Mulder.
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
Nothing completely conclusive --
Yes. I know.
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
Yes.
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
I can't go any farther.
Where are we?
Cold...
I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
No -- it's --
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
Something's wrong...  I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm...
I think... something stung me.
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
You don't Mulder -- you've never needed me. I've only held you back.  I've got to go.
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
I have. I did. It's done.
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
Where'd they go?
What are you doing?
Yeah...?
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
This is weird, Mulder.
What do you think it is?
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
Mulder --
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
-- of what exactly?!
I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
This is great. This is fitting.
I don't know why I think they went right.
We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
I don't know, Mulder.
All the equipment is brand new.
It looks pretty green for this climate.
No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.
He didn't mention a park.
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
Mulder --
I don't know.
Evidence of a massive infection.
I can't really talk right now.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
And you're looking for?
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
Mulder -- what are you doing?
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?
Are you drunk, Mulder?
No.
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
All I told them was the truth.
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
Nice try, Mulder.
Where are you, Mulder?
Scully...
Something sweet.
I just did. You're buying.
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
Oh yeah. Had you big time.
Had you.
Now what?
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
Jesus, Mulder...
Mulder...?
Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost --
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
No. I haven't.
I'm on the roof.
Mulder -- it's me --
Give a kiss to Edward.
...give a kiss to Edward.
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
I know.
I don't need them anymore...
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him.
What's wrong?
Damn him.
Baked in a pie.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
...a pocketful of rye.
What happened?
Is it cold in here?
No.  No.
Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...
She said convincingly.
I'll be fine.
This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so.
He needs to be turned over.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
Why did we stop?
Nothing.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Sing a song of sixpence.
That's my girl.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
Okay.
Don't bring it home in this.
I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
Yes mother.
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
No.
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
Okay, okay...
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
I'd be there for him.
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
I do it all the time!
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
Shush.
Miriam...
I don't want to find out.
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
Someday you can.  We all believe that...
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
She adores you.
Lucien Baines?
He hates me.
Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
Did we go sailing?
Four-and-twenty blackbirds.
A pocketful of rye...
Sing a song of sixpence...
No.  Thank you.
Thank you.
They're hungry.
It doesn't matter...
He's mine?
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
Good for them.
I heard Julia and John got married.
Absolutely.  Abigail...
Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
I can't leave him!
Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust him.
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
Wait...
Okay, okay...
You're sure of that?
Tell me.
What happened?
What happened to Charles Gish?
If you believe that.
Then what is he?
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
You were right.  There's a part of him that knows the truth.  About what he did, about himself.
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes.  He makes Julia real for me.
Why'd you bring him here?
A kingdom.  His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear.  A horrible primitive ugly thing.  I don't want to talk in here.
With Stargher I saw things...
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
Agent Novak?
The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
It doesn't have much to do with science.
Do you think that's funny?
You don't know the procedure.
I realize that...
Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would you go?
I bet we can fix it.
Oh no... No you don't.
Who says?
What now?
He's beautiful...
She's bringing Stargher into hers.
What's wrong?
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
Intravenous administration complete.
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
They took care of that, thank you, Henry.
Completely unaware.
Awaiting his arrival.
That's a secret.
You're looking well.
Agent Novak.
Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
I doubt that.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
What about narcotics?
Any psychiatric medication?
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
Nervous?
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.
Yes.
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
Catherine!
What about the legalities of this...?
When did he lapse into the coma?
They think you did it.
Give her some cigarettes.
Ja, ja, ja.
Ich weiss nicht.
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
Why are you lying?
His.
Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
How do you know?
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
I shall be all right.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
I'm sorry.
Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
How did you know I would be here?
Are you going, too?
There isn't enough for two laughs.
...and my lover. He was Harry.
I'll put these flowers in water.
He liked to laugh.
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
He told you, didn't he?
Have you?
Have you seen Calloway?
What happened to your hand?
Why?
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
Wer ist da?
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
What are you going to do?
Let's not get into any more trouble.
Let's go away.
Yes.
I'm so sorry.
We're both in it, Harry.
I thought you wanted...
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
It's just what he used to say.
...and buried him.
Tell me more.
Where is she?
When...what did you do?
Tell me about him.
Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
What's that?
Well you read this.
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
In German?
Just another part I've got to learn.
Need we go through it all again?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
Whiskey.
Dr. Winkel.
The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.
They're forged.
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
Why don't you leave this town - go home?
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.
I don't know. They didn't answer.
I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
Mmmm.
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
Yes.
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
Oh, yes, yes.
No.
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
Do you understand German?
Sit down.
Nichts danke. Kein.
Thank you.
Of course.
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
I don't know.
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
Where's Harry?
What did you say? I'm sorry...
It's true then?
Two weeks ago.
What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
It wasn't important.
No.
No.
I have never seen him.
We loved each other, do you mean that?
And my passport?
There's nothing in them.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
They're Harry's.
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
Yes.
Good-bye.
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
I don't...
I don't want it.
They are - private - letters.
Must you take those?
You don't own this place.
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
Yeah, okay. But what if...what if... submitting...being crushed, being nothing, not mattering, what if that's the best feeling we can have?
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
No. What are you looking for?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
Lina, come here!
I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff...  Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like...
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
Do they?
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
I told you, I'm good at this.
Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.
You think I should just because there's no reason?
Why should I submit?
Fuck that.
And belief follows?
What's it about?
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
With you there's a tragic dimension.
The sex is better.
Where are they?
It looks a little like a swastika.
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
What assholes.
That's stupid.
Why not?
I'm good at languages.
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
I want to learn to read it.
What's it mean?
Oh, yeah...
'Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here...
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
Do you know it like that? By heart.
How come there's no punctuation?
Where'd you get this?
No.
He's at a home out here.
You can't.
I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda?
Who's Linda?
Bigger and better.
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one.
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
That's stupid. Why would they?
Killing himself.
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
Why no silencer?
Where'd you read all that stuff?
You're not in school? What do you do?
Which is what?
Disease? What disease?
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
Think about your father. Your sister.
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
It was a nine millimeter.
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
This is me.
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.
I thought you hated Torah.
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
The arguments, anyway.
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
Of course.
You're leaving?
And you...?  Do you love Enzo?
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
I can't... I just don't know how to...
No.
Yes.
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
Italian is practically the same thing.
I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
The documents are forged.
The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra!
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
... So am I.
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
What kind?
Is he alright?  What happened?
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
Why?
... Not yet.
How do you know that?
He can learn.  He is learning.
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
I won't, I swear.
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
You know what I'm talking about.
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
What are you doing here?
Enzo!
Is it a poem?
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
The Mamma's there too.
... It's a comfortable place.
Yes...
Well, good night, then...
Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
Congratulations, Enzo.
Okay.
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
No.
And just where are you from?
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
What was he like, when he was little?
Have you known him long?
You'll be lovely, but no thanks.  Jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
You forgot the Hula!
No.
Congratulations.
In a lake.
I think I'll have a coffee.
I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
Yes.
Hello!
The guy in the Halloween suit!
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
Does anybody live to make a second?
Don't you have a heater?
Promise you won't forget me.
Promise me one thing.
You are the father.
Jacques?  I'm pregnant.
You've got to tell me what happened?
Why?
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water?
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
Jacques...?
What are you doing?
... Nothing.
You'll try again tomorrow?
And you?
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
Okay.  In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice.
You sure?
I'm being a pain, huh?
It's me again.
No... tell me.
Then, tell me a story.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
So have I.  ... Hello?
I got fired.
It's me... Johana.
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
I'm going back home.
Aren't you happy?  Don't you feel proud...?  I feel proud and all I did was watch.
Jacques, you set a world record.
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
How do you know that?
How can you tell it's a female?
No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
I'd better get back now.
Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
Lucky I was there to save you.
... Especially the sneakers.
You look adorable.
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here.
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
... Okay.  I'll try.
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
No... in the hut.
We saw each other a little while ago.
Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
What is it honey... the frenchy?
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
No.  I'm just depressed.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
Way past it.
... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales...  or are you still over your limit?
Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.
Haven't you been listening?
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
It's his heartbeat.
Okay... Who'd you meet?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
How was your trip?
What?
Well?
They're going to send detectives.
You called the police?
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
... And the new stereo.
They got the new T.V.
Again?
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
... Sally?
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
... And those?
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
What are they for?
I'll go see how he's doing.
Wait!  Professor...?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay?
Will he understand Spanish?
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
Why is he doing this?
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
But... how is he going to breathe?
I'll have to talk to the driver.
That's the experiment?  Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
Who... Who is that?
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
What do you want me to do?
He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.
It's Esther.
You two know each other?
Mordechai!
Mordechai!
I forgive you.
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
We do!
No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
Relax Morty, I think your mom is wonderful. She cares so much about you. Get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the JDL if I'd come eat by you once in awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be with you. She's so...
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
Kiss me you Semitic stud!
Keep going.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Mordechai?
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
Oh!
What!?
I said, do you come here often!?
Sure. Why not.
So, now what?
Yeah, no kidding.
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
Any sign of Santa?
I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
Hey  I'm over here.
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
Maybe. For three years I've sung in rats' nests, while Jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance. We're due for a little luck!
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches 
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click  click  click.
No - really, I can see them -- they're coming now - turn off the lights 
I thought they came right past here 
I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -
Thanks.
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
That was a calamity!
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
Why did you give up teaching?
What do you do now?
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
It's a lovely town - it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside - where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
I hated you that day - you and your flip talk - with that little girl lying dead.
We stood here once before.
It's all right. I'm not hurt.
We will 
How do you know?
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways 
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
You're positive of that, aren't you?
Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
You. Us.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
And she waited here for him?
Yes. Do you mind?
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me 
Yes.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
I can use them.
And not a sign of the leopard?
Who is he?
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
It must be the altitude  you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootandsaddle boys --
And did you find the leopard?
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors!
What did he have to do - look at the body?
Who was the other man?
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
Don't be soft.
Now look what you've done.
The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
Clo-Clo?
No  not yet.
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
You're too good to me.
On his back, I suppose.
That's easy. Me.
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
Get it out of here!
No - not yet.
You're too good to me.
On his back, I suppose.
That's easy. Me.
Makes no difference. Get him out!
Get it out of here!
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
You wouldnt understand.
I dont know. Everyones dead...
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil...  And his drowning was arranged...
The staff dont know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldnt take any more...
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
No. Not us...
Do you think wed let him get away with the murder of my brother?
He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. Theyll tell you. Call them!
What are you doing? You cant. I...
Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. Thats when he hit me, and told me hed killed my brother... You dont know what youve done, he said.  Were in deep trouble, he said. We, he said. We.  Wed both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
I didnt intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that youd been back.  That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
My husband didnt need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
You seem to know what youre talking about.
Should I?
Simplify and damn.
Here we go again.
Something like that.
Something like that.
I didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
...Were turning in circles.
You splendid bastard...
You bastard...
Why do I feel I neednt answer that?
Good.
Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.
I didnt know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? Ive known for five years. Hes known Ive known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesnt speak about...
That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No.
Youre wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought hed wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I dont know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest...  I didnt know any of this before you left for Los Angeles.
Leon could still have hung himself.
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why dont you accuse me of killing my brother?
...You-you spoke to him?
Leon hung himself...
Leon hung himself...
Leon hung himself.
My brother hung himself.
No!
How... When did you...
Huh! Dont you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
Whatever the reason, Im sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish youd use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what youre owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
Have you finished?
Why... I dont know what youre talking about.
Youre mad...
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
Sorry?
I... If you dont mind, I do not think he matters now. It... Things turned out to be as we thought; Leon was weak. Theres no point in delving into his sad life anymore. Now, will you please tell me how much we owe you?
I... Well, were burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but its late and with the funeral...
Im really sorry you were not called...
When did you get back?
Mr Lombard...
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
Paul Lamont...?
Yes... You woke me up... Its the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
...7548. Have you... Have you found him yet?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
Mr Lombard?
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Are we understood?
Im impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.
Who is Friedman?
You lost my money?
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
I still dont buy your story but I figured it cant do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
Laurence!
No. Youre fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you...
Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.
No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
How dare you...  You dont know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
Oh no. Youll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
Excuse me?
What... What are you talking about?
You... You found that at Leons?
Disney! How inter...
Anything is possible.
Can it be that easy?
Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Dont. You might get confused speaking of things you dont understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until youve done what we are paying you for.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
I wont comment on the time but youll understand if I dont tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard.
Perhaps it wasnt so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Well, Leon does not need money for prints, Mr Lombard. Does his own printing. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art!  Which, as he subsequently vanished, raises the question: what was the money for? Perish the thought.
Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasnt here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over £1,000 to get rid of him.
That depends what youre looking at.
Now you know why youre here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
Huh! And they say charitys only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
My ex-husband. My work drove him away. Made his life a misery. He thinks Im obsessed, punishing myself for what happened to our son.  But hes a good guy. Hell listen to you. He wont turn you in if I ask him not to. I can pretty much guarantee that. Okay?
...Im Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this thats who I am. Do you get what Im fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
Damn it! You cant fucking walk away from this!
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For gods sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think Ill get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, itll be too late.
That-that wont do. Thats not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thats the way...
Were both thinking the same thing, right?
Italian? The Mafia...?
So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
What...?
Look, you dont tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Whos the guy? The Austrian?
Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
What am I to do with the packages if...
Dont fall asleep with your hair wet.
Right... Well, Ill get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my sons. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... Theres some cold chicken salad in the fridge if youre hungry.
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didnt I hear you right?
Did you not enter this country illegally?
Its give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didnt really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
How come youre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Like youll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round?
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassys out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
A recent acquisition. Weve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flats been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
Thereve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, its just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
I might come back, I might not. But if I do, it wont be for a couple of hours.
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
By your Austrian?
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there?
Okay. The woman just cant walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why cant you go to your Embassy?
You...  Jesus Christ!
I cant believe this...  Whats coming now, eh? If I dont pay all Hells gonna break loose, is that it?
Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?
Im fine standing, thank you.
I dont smoke. If you could get to the point...
Youre a long way from home...
May I ask where youre from, Mr Lamont?
Shit! Fuck! Whats fucking wrong with people!  Im going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to!
No. Youre looking at a real Musketeer here, Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there.  Take a prisoner... Might as well have sent them a notice to quit...  Come on, Musketeer! Got anything to say?
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
Thats right. Wheres the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitneys trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
Yes. How did...
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
Your secretary, huh!
Piss off!
Well, Im sorry. I...  This is my nephew... And my brother, Tim. Ive got the week off and hes come to stay.
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe its there with...
Hello there. Hows the flat. I cleaned...
I came to feed your fish. I didnt know...
Shes pretty... See you, huh?
Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, thats what they do to their employees, isnt it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining peoples lives. Thanks for the lift!
Oh no. Im all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true?
Oh... We split up.
So you havent seen the film, then?
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
La collectionoose. Its about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. Its on TV tonight and as Im in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The directors supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?
Yes. But my boss reckons youd still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? Itd cost you about £100 but he said itd be worth it.  Of course, youd need a partner to register. But thats a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?
Must be your lucky day then. Ive got your accounts - you dont owe much tax for last year.
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
Hello again, neighbour. I didnt intrude, did I?
Jah...
£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.
Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
The £1,000 is on account.
When... Im told he came here...
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonards address, keys and other things you might need.
No. And before you ask, no, hes not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
Do what, Mr Lombard?
You wouldnt be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard!
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Must I speak to you in French?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
What if it is?
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.  My husband...  My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is.  My son-in-law, Carlos...  The gentleman is a business partner of his.
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
I'm staying, Jean.
One day you will.
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
I'm already free...
I am ready now...
That's an order!
Do as I say!
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
Not yet!
It would not be the same without you.
If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
But it is what I want.
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
No, but...
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
What did the king say?
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
Tell the king to give me more men.
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
I don't know it.  I feel it.
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
So... what am I supposed to do now?
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
I'll go.
Yes...
Come with me...
The king said you're his finest archer...?
Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
They've started the battle without me!
Good.
What did they say?
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
There's nothing to hear -- I haven't done anything.  And why haven't I done anything?  Because none of you will listen to me!!
Who do they think I am?!
The King of England.  I want to give them the chance to leave Orleans in peace before I get there.
I thought you were an archer?
I also need someone who can read and write.
Better today than tomorrow.
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
And I would like to see a priest.
I would like some fresh straw.
Do you think I could have some water?
No, I... I never killed anyone!
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
No, I... I held it up to...
Yes, but...
Yes, probably... maybe...
No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
To avoid killing anyone.
And so I... I prefer my banner.
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
Yes...
Quite a few.
I leave the answer to God.
I can't read.
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
I don't know...
I don't remember.  Maybe.
I tried to.
I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?
Go onto the next question.
No.  But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.
No...
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
God defeated the English, not me.
My king will pay any ransom you ask.
Where... where am I?
Am I... am I dead?
But where are you going to be?
What about you?
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
No no, I'm fine, really...
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
Please... may I have it back...
And may I go to Mass?
No... I want to be confessed.
I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
Yes...
Many things...
Yes.
Praying.
Last night.
Not long ago...
These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
Not unless you hear my confession.
Not unless you hear my confession.
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
In a village called Domremy.
My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
The English??
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
Trial?  What trial??
Who are you?
Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
So how would you put it?
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
Get them out of here!
... You look wonderful...
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
I didn't wait long.  One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again...
What was my mission?  To help my country?  But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
I know you're not yet -- but you will be, soon.
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
Go on to the next question.
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
Yes.
His face.
Go and ask him yourself.
If there was, I didn't see it...
Not yet.
The bridge won't wait!
Stand by with the battering-rams...
I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
We're taking back the Tourelles!
The wind will be with us!  Do as I say.
Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...
Sooner is better than later!
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
Knowing what I know?  Enormous gratitude.
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
What complicated about it?  All you have to do is do what you're told -- what could be simpler than that? I'm the drum on which God is beating out his message -- beating so loudly it's bursting my ears -- but you're all so full of your own voices, you're deaf to His!
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
God.
We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
For what?
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
Good.  Where are the English?
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
But my voices... they promised me...
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
Never look behind -- only ahead!
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
So... bring up the reinforcements!
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
No... not like this...
Clear?
The English are rebuilding it.
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
I... submit to Our Lord.
It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
The clothes are not important...
No!
Yes, but...
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
That's now what I meant...
No...!
No...
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
Here -- take this instead.
That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
Because... because you just can't!
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
Stop it!  What are you doing?
You don't believe me anymore?
I said, kneel!
A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
If you kill him, you kill me!
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
It's not possible...
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
We... won?!
Not for long...
Prepare these as battering-rams!
I'd sooner die than use magic!
Don't swear...
Were the men confessed?  Where are the priests?
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
No.
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
My king.
Yes... a half-steed... white.
Yes, my lord.
No...
Yes...
Yes I am.
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...
Are you sent by God?
Are you going to leave me too?
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
"Love your enemies"...
No, I...
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
Yes... lots of things!
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
What do you mean, they won't come?
Because... I have to be alone!
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
My... visions...
Yes!
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
I... I never lied!
Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
What are you doing out here?
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
I don't know... I thought...
No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
Who... who are you...?
I -- I -- I...
Playing...
I want to be at one with Him now.
I want to be with him always...
I don't want to wait for his call.
Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
Why did she have to die?
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?
Beautiful.
He never says his name.
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
Yes, it is.
Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Oh yes, she's... wonderful.
Oh yes... very.
Is that bad?
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
My father's.
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
I need to confess again.
I need to confess.
I don't even know you.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
You move right along, don't ya.
Looks like he missed ya.
What does this guy want?
What the hell for?
No.
No.  What's wrong with the front?
Yeh, sleepin'.
2:00 A.M.
Sixty-five.
I don't know.  Depends what train I get on.
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
It isn't any better.
You done?
He's just around the corner.
I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
Just a minute...
He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
It's all right.
I'm sorry.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
Look -- those are the first metals that came through.
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman...
And if it isn't?
Well!
Another young man.
Oh, Andy, Andy!
Why not?
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
Go away!
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
And don't ever try to see me again.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
I can't.
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
Oh, Andy.
And I'll give then proof!
Mother!
Now do you believe me!
Oh!
There!
I don't believe it! You're lying!
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
You hand that over to the police.
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
Then what are you hiding?
I didn't.
You took that money from Julia's hand.
Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
Don't.  It's horrible.
Shush!
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
No.
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
Nothing.
What is it?
Do you know where he's living?  Oh....  Well, at least I'm glad he's all right.  Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
What is it? Has he found him?
Oh, here she is.
Give it to me.
How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?
He didn't do it -- Nick!
He wouldn't say.
He's waiting for you.
Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
Dead?
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder -
That's the truth.
I bought it in a pawn shop.
She... she fell over backwards.
I don't know.
She fell down.
Why... in the heart.
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
There.
You heard about Julia Wolf?
I've got to see you alone!
Oh, thank heaven.
Thanks.  We will.  Goodbye.
How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
tried him once -
Macaulay.
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
Yes.
You don't remember me.....  I'm Dorothy Wynant.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
You know, we know each other.
Hello, there!
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
Better get home before it is.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Only in bad weather.
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
He's a brave man.
And he still wants to marry me!
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
I know -- I know --
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
He's all right.
How's your brother?
That's one thing I won't forget.  Where's Macaulay?  I ought to be starting.
It's a promise?
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
A new invention?
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
Where are you going?
Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
If you think it'll be all right.
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
This is my wedding.
What would your mother say to that?
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
Yes, she would.
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
You see how much we have to say.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
Take a good look at him, Dad.  Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.
Forgive me.  How are you?
It's been the same one for three months.
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
Gilbert!
Not a thing.
That woman!
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
That's ridiculous.
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
Goodbye.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
No.
Why yes.
I see.
You're a great help to a hostess. I wish I always had you for my dinner parties.
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
I think we may as well sit down.
Do you think that Wynant did it?
But he's interested!
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
Why, you said...
and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
Chris -- Chris -- !
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
What are you going to do?
I couldn't go near that woman.
Chris!
I know.
I'll get some.
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
I never had it.
What did you do with the rest?
I can't! I haven't got it!
You're going to return every cent of it!
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.
Go ahead!
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
That's my business.
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
Don't you remember....
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
What bonds?
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
I don't like him.
This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
Who's that man?
So I see.
We're just having a little drink.
Oh, please, Nick.
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
Oh, he's sitting up.
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
No.
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
Thanks, and goodbye.
You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!
No.
I trust you.
Never mind.
That's just why I'm going.
I'm not telling anyone.
Did you get my money?
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted -
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
Nobody told me.  I did see him!
Perfectly absurd.
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
But he has nothing to do with it!
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
Where's Gilbert?
Dorothy!  Is she here?
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
You're always teasing.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
want to talk to you about something very important.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
I hope you're well.
Why are you saying it?
Is that true?
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
You're going to drive me crazy!
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
I wish you'd tell me who.
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
Mimi!
Who do you think did it?
The suspects!  They won't come.
I've got a lulu -- why?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Yes!
What are you going to do?
Why not?
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
I'm going to tell her.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
How long has he been dead?
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
Well, don't they?
What things made you so sure?
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Wynant's body?
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
Nick!
What do you mean?
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
Back to California
I don't care - I'm just used to you, that's all --  If you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
You dog!
You bet I wouldn't.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
What are you going to do?
What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?
He's just been for a walk.
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
Catch me letting you go alone!
So am I.
Why don't you?
But Wynant --- ?
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.
All right, hard guy.  Get up and bleed on the rugs.
Sit down!
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
Oh take it!  Please take it!
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
Yes.
Yes.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Who's that?
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
Finished with these?
You did.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Well, didn't you?
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
Want a drink?
I'll get some towels.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
Someone get a doctor.
You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
But it's Christmas now.
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
I'd like to see you work.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
No thanks.
No.
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
Good. I want to talk to you.
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
What are you going to do with it?
Where did you get that?
Rye.
Isn't that my drink?
Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
Room service, please -
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
We need ice.
Who's that?
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
What hit me?
Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.
How many drinks have you had?
By the way, how is your father's side?
Who is she?
You got types?
Pretty girl.
As long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  What I've gone through --
You might have mentioned me first.
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
So it's you he was after!
Was he a good detective?
Yes.
Yes.  Nick!
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right --
Maybe she has.
I know I left them there.
I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds?
Who fired you?
Home?
Where are you going?
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
Give it to me!
If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
I have to answer him.
They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that.  It doesn't change me respecting you.  And now you let me down.  I expected more from you, you know?  I really did.  I expected you to--
You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
Nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
What if I do?
In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
Get out of my way.
Then step aside.
It's a combat action.
I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
We're at war.
He's an enemy soldier.
You don't know he isn't.
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
He...he could have been watching us.
Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
I told you; don't push me around.
I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
You got no reason to do that!
Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I can do better on my own.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
You're the one with all the ideas.
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
Maybe we should split it up now.
What about the gold?
You ready?
Ready when you are.
Epps!
What am I supposed to do?
Missile!
And they can't fly around out there forever.
Weird they didn't chase us.
Where'd they go?
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
What do you figure it to be?
The US Army:  Always an adventure.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
We can't just go off and--
We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
Yeah.
Should have at least gotten the map off of him.  Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
For climbing.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
What kind of mine?
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
What are you doing.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.
They stopped.
What are we going to do!?
No, please, not again.
I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine.
What?
Oh, God.
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
What's it say?
Paper.
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.
...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.
Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?
You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch.
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.
You want to say some words?
He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
I'm not wasting my water on him.
All last night he could have been--
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
What the hell are you doing!?
What do you see?
You down?
It's got a bottom.
What do you think?
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
We make it, or we go back empty handed.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
We have to do something.
Is there anything you do know?
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
You want to crawl, crawl.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
How long we going to keep this up.
Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
Then lets go back while we still can.
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
We just about got killed.  You know what happened?  We just about got killed, and you want to go on?
We have to go back.
We got to get out of here.
I thought we were dead.
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
Oh, Jesus!
Oh, God!
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
If there's gold.  If!
How the hell should I know how much?
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
If!  If there's a treasure.
Oh, no.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
You're insane if you think you'll find anything, and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive.
Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him it's crazy, Epps.
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
What?
Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
It's a container.  Break the seal.
The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
You ever think about dying?
Jaeger?
Why would they do all that if we weren't?
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
That's in two days.
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
Jaeger?
You really think there's a treasure inside?
You will.  You'll get it.
You get it yet?
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
He says it's a box.
Now you need me.
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
I thought it would be good to know.
I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
THX!
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
They're watching us now.
They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it.
AH UGH.
Don't let them separate us.
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
You don't know.  You don't....
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.
I don't know.
I don't want to lose you.
But...you...
On the cervix transfer, you almost lost the T297.
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
No....I though  I'm afraid.
Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
Don't take anything.
No!  Don't go.
It's 3+27 hundred
What?
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.
That's not food.  Can't be food.
Looks like dirt.
Look,dirt!
Don't be so sure.
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
No, don't make trouble.  It's nothing.
I have to... he's a G-34
I don't know.
He wants me to come to his quarters.
Now.
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
Eat your dinner.
You've seen enough.
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
Well, have you found it?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
What?  I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye!  Yes?
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
Eleven o'clock!
No!
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
Where did you find it?
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company!
Leave me alone! You were willing to sacrifice a hundred thousand francs for her.  Well--  she's worth it! [ You were willing to pay a hundred and twenty-five thousand for a <u>handbag</u>. You can pay a <u>hundred</u> thousand for him!]
And you--
Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
What time is your rendezvous?
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
Spanish passports?
He recognized you!
Five, seven, and nine--
Filiba ...
Darling, remember you're Gaston Monescu. You're a crook. I want you as a crook. I love you as a crook. I worship you as a crook. Steal, swindle, rob--but don't become one of those useless, good-for-nothing gigolos!
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
They're all right, aren't they?
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
But it's not enough!
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
Darling!
Seven and nine!
We'll take the Royal Suite!
The six--
The fourteenth of May.
Right.
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
Yes! Don't you remember the day you took that Chinese vase from the Royal Palace  and made it into a lamp for my night table?
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
Gaston!
Monescu!
Darling!  Now tell me--tell me all about yourself. Who are you?
What time is it?
Thank you, Baron.
I like you, Baron.
No, thank you.
Thank you.
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
No--proud. Very proud!
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
But she talks a lot. And before this night is over, all Venice will know it. And tomorrow it will be Grand Canal gossip! ... Oh!
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
But it could have been glorious.
Divine ...
Goodbye.
Giron...!
I don't believe it!
And you expect me to believe that?
<u>Adolph</u>?
Yes, Gaston?
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
But why talk about robbery on a night like this?
Instantly.
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Yes, Gaston?
No--thirty-five!
Ah, let me have a little fun.
But I don't want to be a lady.
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
Because I want to make it tough for you.
I <u>believe</u> you.
I know it.
I <u>must</u> go.
<u>Shut</u> <u>up</u>--<u>kiss</u> <u>me</u>!  Wasting all this marvelous time with arguments!
But attractive--
Any minute I want!
And you're going to fall for them.
Like that!
Yes, I would!
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that!
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
Talk? About me--about us?
Good night.
Correct!  Good night.
Lipstick?
Hair?
How do you like my dress?
Together.
Um-hum ...
Um-hum ...
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
And so will M'sieu Giron.
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
You're hired!
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
Ye-es?
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
Then I mislay my checkbook--
That sounds sensible.
You think that's too much?
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
This used to be my secretary's room.
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
Right!
Yes!
As you like.
What?
No. What is it? Tell me.
Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll write you the check immediately.
Yes.
Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...
Do you realize I have light eyes?
Peaches and cream.
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
Too much blue in crimson.
What's wrong now?
M'sieu Laval!
Oh!
Oh! You didn't read it!
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
Well--I am Madame Colet.
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
Not particularly.
I remember.
I know that niche.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
That's it! Yes, that's it! ... Jacques!
Yes...?
Jacques!
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
I know!
To M'sieu Laval?
But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?
I don't want your money!
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
I beg your pardon!
Ever had a romance with a crook?
I think you'd better go.
Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words!
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
How much is your salary?
Yes, madame?
Very well, madame. Thank you.
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
Right!
For all the really important things--
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
To me he seems rather nervous.
Well--uh--yes and no.
Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
Naturally not!
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
About what?
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
Yes, madame?
May I?
Please!  Thank you.
Two lumps, madame?
Yes, that's the trouble with mothers. First you get to like them and then they die.
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
Well, where is it?
But you saw it here.
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
Yes, my bag!
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Then why did you do it?
But you're the more intelligent one.
You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.
And to you, Mr. Andrews.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
You're certain?
I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.
Is this in any way unclear?
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
But I was with him the whole time.
Something serious has happened.
I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
I was tired.
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
My God... Cal. Is it a --
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
I felt like black.
You told me to change.
I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
I promise.
I can't feel my body.
I'm so cold.
It's getting quiet.
It's so cold.
You jump, I jump, right?
I'm not going without you.
Will this work?
I'll be right back.
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
I know, I know.
He couldn't have.
Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you --
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
Could it have damaged the ship?
I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it.
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
You're trembling.
Au contraire, mon cher.
To the stars.
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
Fabrizio said you might be up --
I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
Jack, I --
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
A mistake?
I don't know the steps.
May I cut in, miss?
Jack, must you go?
Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
A whole ten cents?!
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!
And...?
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
And these were drawn from life?
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
May I?
What's this?
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
If only it were that simple.
Yes, exactly!
Worse I'm afraid.
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Mr. Dawson, I --
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
Could I speak to you in private?
HELP! HELP!!
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
You're crazy.
I know what ice fishing is!
No.
How cold?
The fall alone would kill you.
Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.
You're distracting me. Go away.
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
Don't come any closer.
I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in.
It's been 84 years...
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.  I only wore it this once.
I should like to see my drawing.
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie.
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
Goodbye, mother.
It's so unfair.
How can you put this on my shoulders?
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
Excuse me.
No, darling, lip rouge--all over your mouth.
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
Oh--a hundred times--
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
Sure! You're never at a loss for words.
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
And <U>do</U> bring Miss Marsh--  --when she's had time to tidy up a bit.
Well--shall we go into dinner?
Yes--I met Miss Marsh. In fact, she always seems to be turning up in the most unusual circumstances.  What's the matter, Miss Marsh--aren't you feeling well?
Hope we're not intruding.
I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
That's fine--because you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life.
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
I never want to go back....
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
It would be a nice change from you.
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
Yes--and <U>very</U> popular--
We'll save you a place at our table.
That's a date.
Good afternoon--
Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
Feeling a little better, I see.
I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
I think you do.
I don't understand.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise.  Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.
Where's Lother?
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
<U>Gladly</U>.
You'll excuse me.
Isn't that interesting?
Montana?
What's the matter?
Jimmy!
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him!  Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Who with?
How well do you know her?
Yes--I remember--
I could see you were pining away--
Good night, idiot!
I think we ought to walk.
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
What?--
What, again?
We'll let it go at that--
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
Yes--is it all right if I come like this?
Don't let's talk about it.
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here.
That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
What are you thinking?
Mighty decent of you, pal.
Thanks.
A little.
I must say you're persistent--  --it's kind of flattering.
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
I'll be there--Good-by.
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
Okay.
At seven-thirty?
But I'll have cocktails with you.
Well, I can't.
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Very--your mother?
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
This is Mr.--er--
Never eat before the show.
You work too fast for me, young man.
You're not very ambitious, are you?
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
Good-by!
Good-by.
So you washed it off!
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
You've got lipstick all over you.
Like her paint job?
Nice lines--
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful.
Yes--are you?
I thought you were one of my friends.
I'm so sorry!
Never mind.
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Oh, there you are--
He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
Why--don't you like him?
Very--
Yes.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
And you've put it over--haven't you?
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
Just what the doctor ordered.
Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here.
Am I a member of this club?
Will be--as soon as the ship sails.
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
Is that one of the Who's Who?
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Get that out of your trunk.
--And he has sex appeal.
Well, he has a straw hat--
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
With your dry wit and humor--
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
I'm getting seasick--
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
Somebody's got to do it--
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
Not a chance--I'm through.
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
Don't, Lee--that's dead.
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
You can't bluff me any more.
Not because of Ned.
--you'd go with him!
You leave the kid alone.
He's all right.
You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
I wish I could.
Why don't you leave me alone?
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
That's the truth--every single word!
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
Say, "Thanks very much!"
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
I'll explain later--
I was in his cabin--
I'm all right.
Aren't the roses beautiful?
Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
I don't understand.
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
Not now.  I don't have time.
Absolutely nothing.
Maybe even my destiny.
Oh, so that's it...
A peace officer... Impressive man
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
Don't worry, Wyatt.  My family's rich.
Wyatt!  My God...
I have to go.
I forgave you the moment you said it.
Wyatt...
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
You feel bad about this?  About me?
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.
Always?
I hate Sadie.
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
And I don't even know your full name.
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.
You know this is adultery.  You Burn in hell for that.
I know, me too.  What should we do About it?
What's wrong?
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.
Room service.
Just doesn't, that's all.
Doesn't suit you.
Just answer.
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
You're a little touchy about it.
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
Fun though, wasn't it?
That was lovely!
I have a better idea, let's run It out of them!
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
What is it?
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you?  Right out loud so I can hear?  Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt?  Will you do that?
You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
I need it.
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
I don't know.  I'm all right.
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
Oh, all right.
No, stay.  Please stay with me.
You get lonely?
Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound.
I think I'll just lie down awhile
Wyatt, I couldn't find a single Store that had laudanum any-
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
Do you think you won?
You were in hell?
Like muddy waters?
Like a veil has been lifted?
I'm okay. Go back to your friends.
Why in the h...
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea.
How old are you?
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough.  You sit right there with your no manners self.
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
What for?
Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
Who is it?
I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
It's healing now.
I cut it on an old rusty knife.
Since this morning.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
You must have been really sick.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
Just stay in bed and rest.
No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
Gideon, don't say things like that.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
It would be nice.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
You're going to find yourself on the floor.
Hush.
Hush.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
You all act like two roosters.
Go back to sleep.
Let us settle this tomorrow.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
Hattie is a different person now.
You must have done something to her.
Good afternoon to you.
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
Let me get you a cup?
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
Tolerable well.
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
Harry, you know everything.
I have someone I want you to meet.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
You should go back and rest.
Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
What's a toby?
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
What must I do?
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
It is so considerate of you.
How are you?
Let's let Molly open one.
See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
What?  What is it?
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
Where was the last place you left him?
Next stop...
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
No, I haven't seen him.
You can bring ONE toy...
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Whadda ya think?
Everything is gone, now.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
I already lost everything once.
How long has -
Surely she is older?
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
Do you think we should take her up to bed?
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
Finn ...
Stop it!
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
He'll murder you when he finds out.
You did what?
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
Finn -
Well ... yes. All right. But -
Who's there?
You're not so old yourself!
Do what?  Oh, I see.
What did I do wrong?
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
Is that all?
Get away from me...
What about school?
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
I can't go home because there's no home left.
I want to go home.
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
Is there anything else I should know about him?
A sin against <i>what?</i>
I did like the music.
I like plaits.
He's a pyjama case, really.
I can manage.
There's no mirror.
But you're Irish!
In the play. She was married, by my age. And Mummy. Mummy wasn't much older than me when she got married. Well, not <i>that</i> much older.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
It's all right, Finn.
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
Victoria -
I'm Melanie.
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
Did you get it?
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with.
That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
I'm glad you think so, but I'm picturing a debt-ridden, thirty-two year-old mother whose ex-husband is being compared to Pablo Escobar.  And I'm wondering who would want to be with someone like that?
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.
Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
How much do I pay him?
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
What is he being charged with?
Arnie, this is crazy.
Why are you talking like that?
Arnie, thank God.
Where are you going?
At least she's alive.
My Leica's gone.
I don't know.
Me, too.
Should we bring the police into this?
Oh, it is?
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
She asked me not to.
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
Why?
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --
Me, too.
It's so frustrating.
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
What do you think?
I don't know.
Not yet.
Caroline --
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
Honey, your father knows the President.
Tell me what to do, Carl.  I need guidance, not a fucking platitude.  I'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with.  I won't do it.  I want our life back.
How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
Just watching you.
Hi.
Women's room, stall two.  Should we stop for ice-cream?
David --
Especially Tiger Woods.  ...Actually, he keeps his on the back seat.
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
I'll put this in the back.
What are you?  A mouse?  Get out of the car and do it.  This is your chance.
There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
When will you do it?
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
You will help me with my other problem.
That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone.
Not in...
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children.  Are you aware of this?
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
I don't think you're going to do that.
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
Well, he's young and he's healthy.
What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
Sixteen next month.
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
So why have you told me about it?
Unless you get caught.
The point is, you've got to find something new.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
Too young for what?
Smells like it.
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
Is that a promise, then?
Are you clean?
Can I see you again?
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Holding hands?
I don't see why not.
And don't make any noise.
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
Out.
Right. You can't sleep here.
Shut up.
Ssshh!
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?
What?
It's where I live.
I'm going home.
Diane.
Thanks.
Will you shutup.  I should never have told you about him.
Can you cover me for an hour?
Simon?  Ohmygod.
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
You bitch.
Yeah.  You know Harry.
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
Where are you off to young lady?
Out.
Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
That's not true, honey--
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
Where are you going?
Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  And I have to get home to my family.
My husband is a good man.
I wasn't cheating!
No!  Never!
I don't know.  I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
Oh shit.
What are you going to do?
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
As much as you used to?
Do you still love me?
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
Harry... snap out of it!
What is it?
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
Did you pork her Harry?
What about Juno?
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
Are we going to die?
Is it working yet?
It makes you tell the truth?
What did he give you?
Don't call me honey!  You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?!  You pig!
Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where did I get this?
Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--
What were you doing there?
Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle this.
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
I'm not wearing any.
Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.
What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
Natasha?
I can do it!
I think so.
My husband can't know about this.
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
I love him.  I have always loved him and I will always love him.  Can I go home, please?
Yes.
What?
Let me out of her!  Right now!
No.
I needed to feel alive.  I wanted to do something...  outrageous. And... I don't know... it felt good to be needed.  To be trusted.  To be special.
I don't know.  I guess I needed something...
Yes.
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
That's none of your goddamn business!  What kind of questions are these?
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
Well, maybe a little.
No.
He needed my help.
Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
I can't, honey.  I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry.
Oh, sure.  Fine.  I'll get some more gravy.
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
They must've just missed me.
My husband the hero.
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
What'd you do, honey?
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
Yeah.  It was great.
It's okay, don't bother, Harry.
Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?
I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
That's fabulous Harry.
How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
Me too.
Okay.
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
Go ahead.
Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye.
What?
He said he was an American agent.
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
Fuck you.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
What's going on, Harry?
No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years--
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
I just glances inside.
Helen.
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
I don't know.  I have to think...
We're going to Paris?
I'm married!
What is it you need me to do?
What's happened?
You'll call me then?
What is it you want me to do?
And you chased one?
Were they trying to kill you?					*
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
You can trust me completely.
Tell me what happened?
That was you?!
Yes.
Worse than Cairo?							*
Where were you?  On a... uh,					* mission?
I understand.
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
Yes.  Go ahead.
Hello?
Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.
This is great, we got cable.
That was so good I am gonna have another.
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?
He wants to speak with you.
Nope.
Yes.
Gotten your mail yet?
What letter?
Did you get the letter?
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
Cancoon.
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
What?
How come?
Really?
I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
... was so romantic.
I think what you did...
I think what you did was...
Is this a joke?
Was it him or you?
You don't know him -
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
Why?
What?
Where you goin', honey?
No no no no no no no no no...
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
I do.
I don't believe so.
You better not be fucking teasing me.
Yes.
What?
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
My pimp.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
You didn't do nothing.
So he really loved her?
You mean she got a bad batch?
She OD'd, didn't she?
I love Janis.
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
What would make you think that?
At the movies?
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
God, Spiderman looks different.
What's that?
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
You bet. How much is that worth?
Do you get paid a lot?
That's a long time.
How long have you worked here?
Wow. What a swell place to work.
Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
Very much. Now, where were we?
Yes, I would.
Burt Reynolds.
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
I don't remember.
Ask me them again. One by one.
What do you want to know?
There's nothing to tell.
How 'bout me what?
Would you like to get some pie?
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
What time is it?
Sure. Why not?
I took a cab.
That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
Sonny kicks ass.
Great movie. Action-packed!
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
Want some Goobers?
The oriental.
What a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You could have been a real dick.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.
Bye-bye.
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
Get it.
Ya looked through it?
The letter he sent.
Don't eat anything.
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
Oh, hush up.
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.
I didn't get any chicken.
The forager's back.
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop.
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
You... you couldn't have heard me.
I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
I...I...We need cash, James.
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying to.  I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon.
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
What does this mean to you?
IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL!
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
Just like that?  You were in prison?
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
You're sure?
Give me the gun.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
It can be dealt with, but only if you want to.  I can help you.
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
What made you think that?
See -- you can drive after all!
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
You have to give yourself up, you know.
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
Shot!  Who shot you?
What's the matter with your leg?
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
Jeffrey Mason?
James, why don't we...?
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...
Who's keeping an eye on you?
I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
Clues?  What kind of clues?
You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?
It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.
And I was in it?  What did I do?
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
What?
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
I have to do this, James.  You're very confused.
It's just a shot to calm you.
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
James, where did you grow up?  Was it around here?  Around Baltimore?
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
What year do you think it is?
Do you know what year it is?
July.
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
You're afraid of germs?
What's wonderful about the air, James?
Hiding?
A jail?  Prison?
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
Do you know why you're here, James.
Change what?
What kind of information?
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
He was fully sedated!
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
No, thank you.
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
You have him in restraints.
He's been tested for drugs?
What?  What did you say?
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
Nine thirty
Sheriff Potter.
John--
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
What do you want?
He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
John . . .
I . . .
I had a fight with Jake.  I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose.  I'm going to take a bus to my sister's.  I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.
Yes.  Yes it is.
Jake.  No.  No!
Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.
When did you buy a gun?
Jake, what is that?
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
How could I?  I was sleeping.
What's the matter?
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
You haven't even looked at them once.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
I put up new drapes, Jake.
Wrong number.
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
Fuck you!  Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you!  John . . . John!?
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
Someone will find me.
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
No.  I swear it.
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
It's . . . it's locked.
The trunk.  It's locked.
John, throw me the keys.
John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?
I'll get it.
I'm here.
Can you climb back up.
Are you all right?
John!
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
But I want to say with you,
He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
But you said we could be together.
Now what?
Is that the kind of girl you think I am?  What can I do to make you relax?
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
He was going to--
Just drive.
It's our money.  He had no right to take it.
He was going to take the money.
I shot him.
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
What?
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.
Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.
John . . .?
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
John!?  What the hell's the matter with you?
Wait.  What about . . . him?
Where are you going?
Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
Let him watch.  I want him to know what he's missing.
Let's do it here.
No.
If you want.
I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
Don't yell at me!  I know it's here! I know it!
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
It's got to be here.  I heard him talk about it.  He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
There has to be!
Don't yell at me!
I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.
I don't know.
What was I supposed to do?
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Are you sure?  About me, I mean?
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
Because I know you're full of shit.
Stop it.
There is no us, remember?
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
Is it so bad?  It would be quick. He wouldn't even have to feel it.
What are you talking about?
John, please--
John?  John where are you going?
We'd have to kill him.
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Lied?  What do you mean?
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
Jake.
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
Take me with you.
Is it pretty?
Have you ever been there before?
How far is it to California?
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
I don't know how.
All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
No.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You never did answer my question.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
Games?
Such as?
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
Beautiful?
You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.
Lift me down.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
Come here.
Those are white words, not ours.
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
I guess it must.
Thank you.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
What happens if you lose?
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
Where you headed?
You've been around.
Where you coming from?
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
Least you can leave.
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
You're not from around here, are you?
Thank you, John.
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
You should be more careful.
What happened to your hand?
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
You sure you can manage?
It's Grace.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
Maybe I don't want you to.
Do you have to call me that?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
I'm just going to my car.
Toby!  Toby Tyler, leave him alone!
I want to stay.
Honest, Toby.  I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
What's your name anyway?
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
But you was going to fight for me.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
How about I pick one out for you?
Got any requests?
What happened to your hand?
I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter?
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
What's your name anyway?
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
But you was going to fight for me.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
How about I pick one out for you?
Got any requests?
What happened to your hand?
I wanna play a song on the juke.  You got a quarter?
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?
<u>Jake</u>...
And I love you too.
Why's that?
Can you make it back up?
Bobby? Are you all right?
Hope is a four-letter word.
My mother died in this canyon.
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
<u>I don't know why</u>!
Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
So, aren't you going to ask me?
He was a scumbag!... He wanted <u>me</u>, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're <u>dead</u>...  You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
What are you talking about?
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
Anywhere?
But I thought --
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
I'm not coming back.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
The money's right here! Get the key!
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
I thought you couldn't get your car.
Because I know you're full of shit.
Stop it.
There is no us, remember?
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
Kill him.
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.
Is it pretty?
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...
You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
You'd never understand.
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
Nothing.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would ... do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
I don't know how.
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
No.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
How do you know he's still not here?
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You never did answer my question.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
And what would that be?
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
Beautiful?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?

A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
I guess it must.
Thank you.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
What happens when you lose?
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
Where you headed?
You've been around.
Where you coming from?
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
Drove into Superior?  What for?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
You're not from around here, are you?
Thank you, Bobby.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.

Maybe I don't want you to.
Do you have to call me that?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
I'm just going to my car?
Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
No baby, you got it wrong.
Anybody hurt?
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Like you helped her, Jake?
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
What's the matter?
No! No! Please!
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
You haven't even looked at them once.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
I put up new drapes, Jake.
Wrong number.
Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
I want to stay.
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
It's like you resent us David. Resent the life you have.
Why?
That counts.
Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--
It's finished. I won.
Think carefully?
My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
We're supposed to be honest.
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.

He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
Yes.
He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.
You use your sleeve.
Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
Yes. Is this David?
I've come to a decision.
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
It means we're probably to tired to remember.
...I can't remember.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Okay.
I don't know. It's been a while.
Oh.
Is Jeremy okay?
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
What does that mean?
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
Is this a religious thing?
And what was that explanation?
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
Twelve years.
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.
He said...
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
I didn't think they'd really do it.
She back in Kansas?
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
Your wife?
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
You want... a free one.
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.
Are you really going to kill them?
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
Three days. Are you hungry?
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
You ain't dead.
Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
Did you... kill him?
R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?
Is... is it... loaded?
But... if he doesn't miss?
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
And?
But he was called...
You were there?
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
Duke.
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
Uh... Duke.
D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
It's only a b-b-b-book...
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
N-no, sir?
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
He's... he's dead.
Ned's share?
Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
I thought I would need it.
Because I kept a copy.  I have it right here.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
That's not my handwriting.
I do.  Yes.
They lied.
I...
I...yes.
I . . ..
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
I wouldn't do it.
It's a crime.
I have to talk to you.
What are you going to do?
Is it over?
Yes.   We've all got to let go.
You're pressuring yourself...
Joe...  Joe...
What would you like it to be to me...?  I, I, I can't invest in failure.
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
Not if you don't grow up...
Maybe I'll tell you later.
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
You do what you want.  You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
Well, then what are you doing here?
And it's over...?
You're talking like a drunk.
Isn't there something you...
Yes.
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
Why don't you get some rest?
Do you want me to go...?
...and is that serious?
What happened...?
Is this a bad time.
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
Maybe what?
And are they going to get it?
I think I will.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
Laura.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Yes.  It was, actually.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
And what are you?  A cop?
The TV didn't work.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Still looking.
Yes.
I did.
Yes.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Yes.
Kathy Costello.  That's my maiden name.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes...
I used to be a nurse.
Mrs. Simmonds.
Who told you that?
Thank you.
How old is he?
You live in the neighborhood?
Hi.
Me, too.
Huh.
The Big Boy did...?
Yes.
Should I?
How'm I doing so far?
I'll give you another complication: he still is.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
He won't talk.
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
She is not my wife.
Nothing.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
Oh, yes. You noticed the way she does her hair.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
Yes.
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
Scottie, I need a friend!  Someone I can trust! I'm in a panic about this!
I want you.
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie.
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
Someone dead.
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
Would you like a drink now?
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power...  the freedom.
San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
Almost a year.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
I married into it.
Love me... keep me safe...
I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you!  Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!
What are you going to do?
Some money.
What are you going to do?
I don't know... Switzerland?
Your accident...
Yes!
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
Yes!
Scottie, please...!
You can't. You're afraid!
No! Let me go!
No!
Take me away...
Scottie --
I'm scared.
Why?
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
But why? Why here?
Scottie, why are we here?
Where are you going?
No, it's all right.
We're going awfully far.
Can't you see?
Scottie!
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  And... let's see... to start...
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
Too late. I've got my face on.
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
Is that the best you can do?
Well, after all, it's "our place."
Ernie's?
Where shall we go for dinner?
We tried it. It didn't suit me.
Well?
All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
Ah, no!
You don't even want to touch me.
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
No, you wouldn't let me.  And I don't want to go...
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
I don't like it!
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
You want me to dress like her?
But why?
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
Scottie, what are you doing?
But I like that one, Scottie.
But Scottie, you don't have to!
Honest?
Yes --
I like that one.
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
Why?!
That's not very complimentary, either.
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
No? Then what?
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
Tomorrow night? Well --
Thank you again. Good-night.
Mmm.
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
Because I remind you of her?
Dinner... and what else?
No, you don't owe me anything.
Why?
I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it?
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
Salina, Kansas!
I told you! Right here!
About three years.
It's a place to live, that's all.
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
Judy Barton.
What do you want to know?
Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
Why?
What about?
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
Do you live here in the hotel?
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
What for? Who are you?
Please. Because I love you.  He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her.  And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run.
Let me go into the church alone.
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
You believe that I love you?
Let me go! Let me go!!
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
Please let me go.
To the church, I must go there.
Let me go.
You can't.
Too late... there's something I must do...
I love you too... too late... too late...
Yes.
Here with you.
I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...
No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
No, never!
Yes?! But --
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
No, don't go away!
I had the dream. The dream came back again...
I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
Don't leave me... stay with me...
I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen...
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
No.
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
I know.
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
A grave...
No... it's in shadow.
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
Vaguely...
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
...somewhere in the light.
Take me away from here?
No! Please! Please, please, please, please, don't ask me!
No, I can't tell you!
No!
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
No, don't ask me!
No!... No!
Long ago...
Yes...
The tall trees...
Here with you.
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
No, thank you.
No.
And no birds sing.
Do you hear anything?
Knowing I have to die...
I don't like them.
Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
The oldest living things?
How old?
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
No.
I don't know.
Good-bye.
We have.
What?
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
No! No, thank you!
I enjoyed talking to you.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
Oh! Yes. Hello.
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
What?
No... it's wrong.
One shouldn't live alone.
That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
You like it, too.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
Oh... wandering about.
When?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
At...
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
No...
Why am I here? What happened?
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.
No, not exactly. Want to see?
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
What have you been doing?
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
Oh... this and that.
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Oh?
Did you need it?
Oh?
Where?
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Bye-bye!
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Is she pretty?
Think?  Well, what do you think?
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
You haven't told me everything.
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
The poor thing....
Pop Leibel? Sure.
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
Pop Leibel.
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Johnny!
Easy, now.
Step number two.
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
That!?!
How?
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
What.
Sorry, old man. Work.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
Three whole weeks.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Normal.
That's following a train of thought.
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
Oh!
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
Well?... what'll you do?
Ah, Johnny-O...
It's where you belong.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
Johnny, the doctors explained --
It wasn't your fault.
Why?
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
More than you think.
What's tomorrow?
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
So where's that leave us?
Well, oh...
What does that mean?
Money?
My god.
Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
Move the bodies.
The only proof is those bodies.
Like how?
What does that mean?
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
No buts. I've waited twenty-seven years, twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle. I will not be derailed! I will not be embarrassed! I will not be denied! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water!
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
Call the police.
You killed a prostitute.
You fucked a prostitute?
Who's dead?
What are you talking about?
What kind of stupid question is that?
What?
Don't even.
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.
No.
Yeah. You.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
I won't even discuss it.
We're not canceling.
Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...
No way.
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Are they fighting?
Now?
Well, can you come back inside?
After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house...
"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge.
What's the word on the chairs?
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
The chairs.
What okay?
What about the chairs?
How late?
Where are you?
Hello.
Go have fun. Not too much.
Yeah. Nesting.
Just a bit of organizing.
Well you should.
That's sweet.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
Hello.
Have a nice bachelor party.
Just call and let me know that your okay.
Do you love me?
Will you please call the chair people?
Maybe.
Take care of those chairs.
Do you love me?
I need your help.
I need your help.
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
You go down there.
Not padded ones.
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
Keith do not trivialize this.
Seating problems.
We've got problems here.
Kiss me...?
How much?
Do you love me?
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
I've seen it on television.
It's vile!
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
Why? What's his problem?
He's weird.
He's weird.
I just don't see him in the big picture.
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
Charles Moore for instants.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
He's a moron.
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
Right before the wedding?
Well it's bad timing.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...
Don't you dare.
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
What else have you forgot?
You can't play around with these tent people.
Why did you forget the tent check?
Why?
You forgot the tent?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
Caterer?
Florist?
Photographer?
The wedding cake check?
What do you mean, you think so?
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
Why is this Kid staring at me?
Can't we do it on the phone?
Why can't we do it through the mail?
This is ridiculous.
I do.
You know,  Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me.  Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.
"You Send Me."
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
A mutant species.
The stone age.
...embarrassing, shameful...
That's our plan.
We will.
We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
Let me pass!
Go away! Leave me alone.
You're lying.
Don't go!
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
Maybe ...
Unfortunately ...
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
Wasn't that cowardice?
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
I don't like masquerading, but as you see I decided to give in to your whim.
Today I can refuse you nothing.
Whatever you like.
Thank you, Uncle.
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
And this innocent child.
Evil.
How could anybody behave like that?
Don't you ever see him?
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
Only because you want it.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
Come down.
Who is she?
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
No.
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
Yes, Uncle. How are you?
Ramona! Ramona!
But why? Why?
My God, what have you done to him!
That doesn't matter; I like it.
It's very good.
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
Me?
Why?
Is she coming back?
And ...your friend?
Yes. Why?
I'll be ready.
Are they going to work here too?
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
Do they worry you that much, then?
Leave him alone.
I'm not like you, you have your wife.
I know that you used to work with an architect.
I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
Well... is it so urgent?
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
Are you Jorge?
Stop this!
Don't say that.
Are your parents alive?
Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time ...This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through.
How are you today?
I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
Where?
Why not?
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
I can't do anything to make you stay? These people annoy you, isn't that it?
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here.
What's going on, Moncho?
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
Forgive me if I have offended you.
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
I had so many things to think about!
Mother.
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
All right, Mother.
Mother?
If you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little self-control, and be a bit more humble to everybody.
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
Don't talk like that!
Good, then let's go!
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper.
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that.
What about you, Manuel?
Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
Have I slept long?
What happened to me?
I have a headache.
Ah! Pleased to meet you.
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
How did you see me?
What?
Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
Hello.
Got it.
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
I need your help--
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is.  But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming.
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
I should have told him.
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
What's the assignment?
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
Then fix it.
Talk so I can understand.
Turn it down!
Show me his physical sensory level.
What's wrong with Parker?
What do we do now?
Duck!
I couldn't tell you.
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
I don't know.
My guess is dead.
More or less.
You okay?
That's why I'm asking.
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go  right now.  Why are you going to do this?
Can I ask you something?
Find out anything?
Thanks.
I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
That, or living through him...
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.
You're not capable of it.
How did you find out about the toxin?
He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
We know you didn't kill those guards.
No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
Parker - stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you
Which way?
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing.  Whatever it is, he isn't finished...
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
I'm doing the best I can!
This isn't a game, Parker!
Enjoying yourself?
What did you do to those people?
What the hell's going on?!
Don't get out of the car.
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
How did you get your hand out?
And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.
Give me your wrist.
In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
As a matter of fact, it is.
But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones.
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
Who said that?
I am impressed.
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
I'm still working on it.
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done.
He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
You ready for this?
You all right?
It wasn't a lie.
What you need is a collar.
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
That's not true, Parker.
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe.
What are you talking about?
...the Harvester...
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
You can't tell this story.  He's not kidding you.  You can't tell this story.  <u>You</u> knew that.  The pay off was, you get to be Ambassador, or...
...his Triumphal Plane.  Shot Down.
...where?
<u>IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS</u>.
Oh, Lord....
Well, get on the phone, and <u>get</u> it...
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...
Much more...uh, he have much more time to "serve?"
He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?
We've got to put that, into the Inaugural.  "I have here, a ribbon.  You haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often <u>now</u>.  For it is the Proud Possession of a few, a very few Men and Women... it is the Ribbon of the Albanian Campaign...."
...The Albanian Campaign...
Indeed it is.
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
Mr. President, this is St...
All we have to do now is sell it to the President.
...this is a snappy song....
A new <u>take</u> on the...  Well, sir, we're coming back, we'd like you to try it out, this evening...
...can we have a white one...?
A small, "calico" kitten, sir.  "Calico."
And...she's not an Illegal Immigrant?  Is she?  Can I see her "chart?"  Because...
Miss, we are going to ask you to sign this little sheet of <u>paper</u>...
What can it hurt.
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
NY Times, Washington Post, War, War, War.  Times got the girlscout page twelve, Post in Section Two.... Horses in Mid-Stream...?
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of...
...but the President wonders about the Possible Albanian Backlash...
The <u>thinking</u> is, as of this moment, <u>Terrorism</u>...  ...they're getting a Good Reaction on the "Albania" thing...
Ames here.  <u>Yessir</u>...
No, this is great.
You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is....
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....
Could we have you in here, please...7
... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?
Well, he doesn't have his Green Card.  He Doesn't have his Greencard.
How do we explain <u>that</u>?
Oh.  Hell.  And what do we do now?  What do we do <u>now</u>? Boy Producer?  Mister Win-an-Emmy, Social Conscience, <u>Whaleshit</u>, save- the-rainforest, Liberal hire-a-convict <u>shithead</u>? Mister Affirmative-Action Peacnik.  Commie... <u>shithead</u>....?
No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...
...what are we going to do...?
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this?
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but it's <u>more</u> than that.
Fine.
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"...
He thinks it's too...
Gloria -- sell the House.
Oh, Lord....
Oh, God...
What are we going to do?
What are we gonna <u>do</u> about it...?
No.  I was busy.  Yes, I need the new poll fig.... <u>how</u> long?  I'll call in from Nashville.  And patch me through to the Big Bird, will...?  I've got to <u>hand</u> it to you.  <u>They</u> sure let us out of there easy....
And I'd like to point out that I've been on prescription <u>medication</u>, the side-effects of which...
Brazen it through?  Brazen it <u>through</u>?  They're going to hang us out to dry like the <u>laundry</u> --- do you know what we've <u>ddd</u>...
...fourteen years...
You missed your <u>plane</u>?  My <u>life</u> is over.  My <u>life</u> is over.  What have you <u>done</u> to me?  What have I done?  Fourteen years of Public Service...
Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.
8 days and we bring it back home....
...this is magnificent.
You're tired, Ronnie.
<u>Nashville</u>...?
How long you been up, you need a nap.
Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow Moss want?
Catching up on his reading.  Asked about you, sends his thanks.
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
...uh huh...
Our adopted land...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
...this's <u>good</u>...
Get on this, right now...
No rain.
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?
New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission.  <u>No</u> mention of the Girlscout. None.
Yes.  That's true.  But...
...what's the Long View?
...hell of a price for the country to pay.
... they're checking the ratings...uh...
...I just hope...
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
...can we see the Kitten...?
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
...where is the Back End coming from?
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
What did Albania ever do to us?
...<u>nothing</u>...
Why?
<u>Who</u>?
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
...they sound what?
Why?
...you want us to go to War...
...but...
Yes
...the...
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
Tell me again.
Tell, tell, tell me again.
I'll see you at National.
Twenty thousand dollars.
It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
It's going to be fine.  It's going to be ... you remember in 88, when...
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
What would do that...?
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.
It won't hold.
<u>Do</u> it...
What crisis?
Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...
We're going to have to explain away the...
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
It won't hold.
When do we bring'em back?
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
Don't you want to know if it's true?
We are virtually certain it isn't...
Three minutes.  It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
Oh, MiGod.
You're just the President of the company, what do you know? ... Come on.
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
All right, Bud... let's do it.
Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.
...and if I did, what's in it for moi?
Yeah, right...
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
Okay.
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
What was that?
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own...
Hi.
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
I'll let you know.
Do you think you're ready?
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
...isn't it perfect!
I don't.
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
You really do believe in destiny?
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
What if I have a previous engagement?
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
Where is it?
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
Oh yes, I remember you.
Excuse me.
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
I can't...and I won't.
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
It's over you, Gordon.
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
Then we both are.
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
What?
No.  But once I heard...
Did you?
A ghost?
I started seeing things.
What do you mean?
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
So much.
I miss you.
Listen to me.  The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother.
Are you mad at me?
I know he does.
He loves you very much.  He just--
Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is.
That's not true.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
No, he wouldn't.
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
Why?
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
That was very good.
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
Of course you will.
I'll come back all the time.
I know that.
It's only two hours away.
Yes?
Hey.
Do you have a scarf?
No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
Last year.  I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this...  ...a minor concussion.  But the car looked bad.  It could have been bad.  I think it scared the hell out of Norman.
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
No.
She said, "You know."  That I know.
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
Yes, but...
What's happening to me?
How?
Are you humoring me?
You think that'll help?
What?
What do you think I should do?
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
These are good.
You're joking.
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
No.
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
Because he was worried about me.
I didn't want to come.
Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
Who's that?
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
At the party.
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
Uh-huh.  What can be?
I'm sorry?
Almost.
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
I am.
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
Oh-kay...
When...when will she be back?
Well maybe your wife...
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
Um...
I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here.  Perhaps we could be friends.
No.  No, I don't.
You must think I'm pathetic.
I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
Um...sure.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
What?
Love.
You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
No.
And these roses.  They're much prettier up close.
Thank you.
Your house is so beautiful.
Very much.
Would you like some iced tea?
Right.  I'm sorry.
And then you weren't there.
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
You do?
I wanted to apologize.
Wait!  Don't go...
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why don't you...
This fence...it's so...
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
I've never even met you.
That's not...It's not like that.
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
Tell me.  I can help you.
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
Tell me.  Please.
I can't, no, no, I can't...
What?  What are you afraid of?
And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of...
Who?  Your husband?
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
I'm not...
Hello?
Is everything alright?
I've seen you.  From the window.
Um...yes.
You're the flower lady.
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
Who are you?
What was her major?
Of course.
I should be going anyway.
You must have been very proud.
I don't know.
She never mentioned her father.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
It's fine.
Claire.
No, I don't.
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
Mrs. Frank?
I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
She's making this up.
Do we have to?
Stop.
Oh God...
We were suite mates.
He was so pissed.
I didn't sleep with him.
He looked like one of the Monkees.
We know each other.
Wow.
Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go.
I don't know...
You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
I guess not.
What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
Jody he was lying.
Did he say that?
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
What is it?
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
Like what?
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
That could take days.  I need to do something now.  Don't you see?  She wants us dead.
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
I can't believe this is happening.
I know.
Jody, she tried to kill him.
No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
If she was dangerous before--
I don't know.
What are you going to do?
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
No.
I'm a terrible friend.
All of us.
I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
I had just been left by Richard.  I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
Relieved?
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
Why?
I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
Adamant?
I was down in Adamant...
Oh God...you knew.
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
Okay.  Okay.
Please.
But Claire--
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
Hartford?
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
Did I?
Something was there.  You saw it.
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Then what was it?
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
What?
Jody, she's alive.
Does Norman know?
I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
It's alright.
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
I think so
Are you okay?
Jody, wait.
I have to go.
It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
Mef?  What's Mef?
M-E...
Oh...
Shhh.
Nothing's happening.
I don't know.
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
This.
The planchette?
Place your fingers on the planchette.
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
Sit down here.
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
I don't...
In the window.  Norman's at work.
What?
Someone's there.
Please.  That's all I need.
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
...no...no...no...
Telling you...
Jody, no...
Seance.
What?
Know what I think?
I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
You think he killed her?
You got it.
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
Absolutely.
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
It's niiice.
Yep.
Oh my god.  You bought it.
So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
Thanks, but I'm fine.
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
You're discussing me with your psychic?
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
Jody--
Kambucha mushroom tea...
What is it?
Wow.  Got here just in time.  I brought you this.
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
Well good.  So you're human.
Okay, I'm a little tender.
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
You are?
Good.  I'm good.
How you holding up?
MADISON!
Mauduh...
Mmmuh...
I don't believe you.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
You don't have to do that.
Nothing.
Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
Do you know it?
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
Adamant.
Look for antiques...
The leaves...
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
She can't be here without me.
She's gone.
It's alright.
Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be?
She did it.
How did she know where it was?
Get out of my way.
You should have tried harder.
I'm not going to listen to this.
Stop...
Leave her out of this!
Who?
...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
So you fucked a student?!
I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
I was there.
"You know..."
Your wife...
I think she's starting to suspect something.
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
Since when?
What's the matter?
Wouldn't go that far.
It's Madison Fra--
...I'm positive this time...
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
Yes.  The ghost.
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
Not personally.
What's wrong with me?
But I don't remember.
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
In the living room...
I...
When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
You told me that I was...
I felt you...looking through me...
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
Are you glad?  I'm glad.
Yep.
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
Then where is she?
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
I will NOT.
No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
The accident...?
Sabotage?
What are you...?  No.
What?
Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
We had a seance.
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
Norman...
I don't need a shrink.
Well, that's a relief.
We're going to be fine.
You're not at the center.
Five minutes?
What are you doing?
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
...Don't get all...
Tonight?
Oh.
When?
Dressed?
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
I didn't do that.
See?
Okay.  Okay.  I'll bet there's...Look at this.
Where is she then?
It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
A flare?
No.  Look!  In the window.
No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from here, believe me, I...  All right, look at this.
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
He killed her.
Shhhh.
Get down!  He'll see.
Huh.
Did you call about the Feurs?
Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
What?  No.  No.
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
I'm so sorry.
That's...
Oh, no...
Well, that's nice.
Wow.
You're kidding.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
You are so brilliant.
Really?
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
I don't know.  Just...whispering.
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
In the house.  I was scared.
There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
No, no.  It's fine.
Oh.
Hi.
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
Hurry...
Norman, you have to look at this!
Promise?
I just wish you could have heard her.
I know.
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
But what if something happens?
That's not what I'm sug--
To make sure she's all right.
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
More or less.
Of him I think.
After that.
Tomorrow.
Mmm.
Shhh.
Yup.
Nope.
I know.
We did.
To get my life back.  To have some time for myself.  Some time for us.
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
Not the focus.
I am, really.
Fine.
If you have to work...
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
Three o'clock.
Yep.
It's Saturday.
Don't.
Norman Spencer.
She's awake.
What's their name?
I think three...
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.  Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...?
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
You have the Mayfair eyes.   Tell me, Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?
Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.
She didn't feel them
Put your hatred for me aside, so you can clearly see what is ahead-
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
What is it...?
And this - if you decide to take the rest.
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
In the coffin, my dear.  where else...?
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
I had you sent away.
I under5tand.  All the same
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
Diedre Mayfair was your mother.
This is your aunt.  Carlotta Mayfair.  In New Orleans.
When did she die...?
I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair.
Who is this...?
E11ie - Diedre died at five o'clock this morning.    Obviously, there are 1egal matters.  Your discretion will be -
Sounds good - thank you
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
I thought you were someone else
I'm sorry - I didn't think
I heard something like that
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
The one on the left - definitely...
Yes - I have had it for years.
I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
No - I've been abroad for a long time...
I know what you mean - I'll meet you at VINNIES WINE BAR at six if you like. And don't make any plans for this evening...
All the time?
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
And it can't be forged?
So there is only one key...
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
But - If you could show me round now - and I'll meet you later?
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
When could I look round?
Yes - it's about bank safety deposit boxes - I wonder if you might just explain how they work - and maybe even show me round.
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
Don't you want me now LESLIE
It's what you would do to me
You killed my friend!
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
I don't like sugar
Why did you let him in?
He doesn't need to...
No thanks -
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
I am sorry...
LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
Where are you going?
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
What is it?
What's wrong?
Nothing could be better...
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
What?
Then make it stop...
What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
STEPHANIE?
Did you?
Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
Why should I?
That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick -
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
What didn't you like about her?
then why did you marry her -
Tell me about your wife...
How long have you been watching me?
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
What did you do with her?
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
I don't know
Where do you kill them...
You don't know?
And how many people have you killed?
And how long have you been a dentist?
So what do you do?
Sugar?
I think I will pass...
Don't worry - Is that my hammer  Well Just make sure that it's put back in the garage...
My names isn't ANGELA...
What's with all the locks - and hammering
What are you doing?
Do you take sugar?
I lost the touch
Sure...
I really don't know what to say
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
I'm your landlady
I want you out now
Yes I can...
You heard me - keep away from him
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
Well, what do you think?
At 2.00...
I think you had better leave
Get out...
At home alone - where were you?
You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?
What brings the rats out of the sewers?
What's this all about?
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
What gives, Don Corleone?
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
We miss our family.
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance.
Sweetheart, what is it?
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
Well?
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
Ted! Do something!
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Teddy? I was thinking.
Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours. ALL YOURS.
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
And who IS Ted Nelson?
Who exactly ARE you?
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
That's me.
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy."
It's your car. These are all your cars.
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
Want a lesson?
You do know how to drive?
They're in the ignition, silly.
You better.
Let your fingers do the walking.
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?
I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
Very ambitious. I like that.
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted.
You think you're working with chimps here?
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
That's hard to believe.
Maybe someday.
Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
Not a chance.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
I'm very aural.
That's refreshingly deviant.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I'm trembling with excitement.
Amen to that.
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
Well? Where the hell are you?
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.
But you never do.
I know.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
Eventually you'll let go.
It's incredibly simple.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
Your dad taught you everything.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
I doubt it.
He phoned it in.
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
He didn't. He had it built.
To the best hiding place in the world.
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Interesting.
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
Then I'll write about YOU.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
In what sense?
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
--Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
But who would run the store?
Like what?
Oh. Goodness.
But how would we pay our bills?
You promise you'll finish school?
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
What is all this? When are you coming home?
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
That's part of growing up, honey.
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
I'm fine.  Nice TV.
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
And the child...
Was there ever any kind of investigation...
She still work there?
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
Try, Kelly.
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
You mean he withdrew...
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
Then what?
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
Did you try to fight him?
He was large?
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
I understand.
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
Take your time.
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
I know you do.
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
Suzie?
You could tell me where you were last night.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
Suzie Toller is missing.
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
I'd like that.
It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it.  I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track...
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
Ray, you heard him...
We don't know that, Ray...
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
Where's the body?
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
If you want company...
You have someplace to be?
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
We all have...
You could say that.
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
Eliminate the competition.
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
Unless what?
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
Lombardo's settlement?
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
The skinny brunette.
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.
Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
Back to the land of grownups.
He said, "No little bitch can ever make me come."
What was that?
He did say something.
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
At that point were you able to fight him off?
I guess.
Did he come in with you?
Yes.
So you were alone.
No.
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
Yeah.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
About a year ago.
We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
Why is that?
Yeah, maybe, a little.
That bothers you?
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
This wasn't my idea.
I said he did.
Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
I wanna go home now.
Yeah... okay... he did
Shit.
I wanna live at the beach someday.
I think we just need to get wasted.
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
Nothing.
What are you looking at?
What brain?
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
You are.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
You can trust me.
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
Get off my property.
Police -- God -- get a life.
You're out of your mind.
Excuse me?
About what?  How to improve your breast stroke?
Is there some reason why you're here?
A friend of mine bought a boat.
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
Yes.  God, Mom...
I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
No you don't.
I miss Dad.
No thanks to you.
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
You notice my new jumper?
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
Hi, Mon.
Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys.
I'm running away.
No little girl can ever make me come.
Say you love me.
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
Okay.  I love you too.
But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
I don't know.  I want to see you...
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
God, I've been calling you.
Hello?
There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
I'm here.
You know what it takes.
Why can't you come...
Yes.
Stick?
Do it to ourselves?
Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
How much?
So you got my mom's money.
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
Look, he forgot.  I knew it.
Don't forget the car wash.
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
Davy.
Shut up.
Get away from me.
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
About what?
That's cop bullshit.
You got something against cigarettes?
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
Will they?
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
I did.  At Blue Balls.
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like it.  Especially the part about offing me.  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a new friend.
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
What?
But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
Are you mad at me?
Yeah, right.
But I..
Sam...
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
We'll see.
Fine, I'll stop.
I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.
My.  It's gotten longer.
She's perfectly safe.
You've... done... this... before.
Would that include me?
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
You most certainly do.
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
Yes, in a way.  I'm the Doctor's social secretary.  I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.
Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
My... the wild west.
Really?
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
As above, so below.
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
I will!  But I need help!
He's no magician.
Patience, Willow.
Time is running out.
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Just do it!
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.
More!  More!
Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!
Tir Asleen.
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
Now use it.
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
Shhhhh!
That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
Me!
The art of transformation!
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
What's the magician's weapon?
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
Burn it to a fine ash.
As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
Then I will teach you.
You must learn magic.
A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool can use it.
Did *you* give that acorn its power?
Kill him!
Kill him!
What do you want!
Who are you!  Who are you!
Here. Whenever you want them.
I want you to take this... to remember by.
That's God's way!
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
You're so sure of that?
I was being foolish?
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
When will you be going?
But... You may not be well enough.
I'm sorry. I'm sure it is.
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
What else can you do?
You know carpentry?
We had some lemonade and he left.
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
Oh. The bullets.
You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry.
But Stoltzfus said...
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
Buttons are Hochmut.
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these.
Enjoying your reading?
It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for.  That is not for Samuel.
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
You tell him. When you're able.
But you can't.
Two days.
What?
Only the elders.
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
But 
But why?
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial?
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
You couldn't wait until morning?
Where are you taking us now?
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
But why would they murder...
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.
Your sister said you don't have a family?
But not a good tired.
I would not be too sure.
No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
We do not go into your courts.
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
It's not a joke.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
You have no right to keep us here.
Where are you taking us?
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
Good morning.
Yes.
Yes, thank you very much.
I have to help him!
You shame yourself.
I will be the judge of that.
I am not a child.
That is idle talk.
I have committed no sin.
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
I know.
No...
His name is John Book.
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
My son is out there!
You might have killed him!
You have no right here!
No, you listen. Get out!
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
They are English. They don't understand.
No... No. It is just the English way.
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
No --
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
No --
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
Oh -- all right.
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Aunt Em!
You are?
Who are you?
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
Our echo.
Oh --
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
Ohhh!
Oh ....
I don't believe you!
Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
Hickory!
Oh!
This?
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
Run, Toto, run!
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Oh, please give me back my dog!
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
Yes, I'm ready now.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Are you ready now?
Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.  I love you all, too.  Goodbye, Tin Man.  Oh, don't cry.  You'll rust so dreadfully.  Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.
Whenever you wish.
Oh, now?
Toto, too.
...Toto, too?
I have?
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
I thought you said she was dead.
The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear.  It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now - you may all come out.
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
Toto's my dog.
Oh!  Well....
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
But you couldn't have been, could you?
Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
Oh, you....
Oh, no -- no!
...paper?
Has it poppies on the wall....
What's she doing now?
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
Me?
Oh --
That's right.  What's she doing?
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
That's our farm!
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
No, they won't - honestly.
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Why --
How did you guess?
Stop her!
Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
No --
Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
...yes.
Yes...!
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
I knew you would!
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
Oh --
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
What sort of an animal is that?
Oh --
Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
Oh-oh-
Oh --
Oh! Oh!
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already.
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
Oh --
Oh --!
Well, you're perfect now.
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
...Oh, did that hurt?
Oh...
Where do you want to be oiled first?
Did you say something?
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
I think I'll miss you most of all.
Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas.  Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.  Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
Oh, now I'll never get home!
Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
Ohhh!
Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
Oh --
Does it work?
Oh -- Oh, come on.
Oh, come on.
But why?  Why?
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
Supposin' you met an elephant?
How about a hippopotamus?
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
I'll be home in time for supper!
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
Yes -- let's run!
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
A home --
Oh.
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
No, but you tried to.
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
I have so got brains.
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Did you just hear what I just heard?
Oh -- Oh --
Oh -- and I was so happy!  I thought I was on my way home!
Oh --
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
Oh --
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
Yes --- there.
Here -- here --
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
Yes.  Oh -- look --
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
Oh --
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
To Oz?
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
I don't blame you for that.
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Um-hmm.
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Um-hmm.
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Ohhh --
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Ohh!
...yes.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
...don't talk.
Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
It's too late!  There they....
...ting the ruby slippers?
Leave her alone!
So isnt it time you unwrapped your present?
We cant.
But what if...
What kind of bikes did you ride?
Do you know what youre doing?
Hes going to insert the plutonium.
Is there another way?
Zukovsky...
The King pipeline.
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  Hes not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
What is it?
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
Whos she?
What the hell are you talking about?
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
Its a bomb alright. Were still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
The plutonium is missing.  Theyve taken the core!
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
They wont get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
So who are you?
He is an impostor.  Theres no Davidov at Miratom.
The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we werent around, theyd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
What happened to Len Tashka?
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.
You new?
Oh James.
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. Im going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfathers name, the glory of my people.
It is my oil!  Mine and my familys!
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
Just like you...only you were even easier.
Since I was a child, Ive always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
Soon shell be everywhere.
I could have given you the world.
You do what you have to do, but Ive called in M.  Shes en route from London even now.
You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didnt have to sleep with you to find that out.
I dont know what youre talking about!
Are you saying...Renard is the man whos trying to kill me?
...what?
What are you talking about?
Whats wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  Ive never told anyone that.
You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
Really?
You had your chance, James. Now Im looking for a bigger thrill.
Someone wants to kill me, Id rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
Vodka martini.
I dont want to be safe!
Then take me with you.
James...
What is it?
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward.
I know.
No!  It will cave in!
I cant stay here.
Oh my God...were buried alive...
You dont take no for an answer, do you?
I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
Thats every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  Thats why youre here, isnt it? You think I cant do it. You think Im going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
If youve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I dont need a third...
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Hes decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
Partially, yes.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I dont want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  Im not sure he knew that.
I havent been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
I met you at my fathers funeral.
What class sub does your nephew run?
What is this place?
Bond!
What?
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if theyre coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back.
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Please.
Could...could you come?
Everythings under control up here.  Are you ready?
No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
What do you think?
Of course...
How would you know?
Warm.
What?!
I would like to use the bathroom --
Why?  What's the problem?
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?
Jon --
Jon, where are we?
Jon -- what??
What -- am I --
Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
Jon, I do not want to hear it.
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
You -- you know about me and Dan?
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
Jon, no -- I can't --
Collect me?
. . . And just how would you manage that?
Mm hmm.
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
Blake?  Dead?
We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
Dan -- what do we do now?
Everything's changed --
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
Where did he go?
What was he doing?
Welcome back, Night Owl.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
What's he doing?
. . . What??
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
That's because --
Yes you are.
The costumes.  Am I right?
They're practically on us . . .
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
They're following us.
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
Okay!
Don't look.  Turn around.
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
Antarctica??
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
His what?
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
You're sure?
Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
Damn straight.
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Jon??  You mean he's --
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
Am I free to go?
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
What does this mean?  What does it --
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
Then why don't you ask him?!?
I don't know their real names!
I don't know their real names.
Maybe I'll do that.
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
Please.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
Adrian.
What are you doing?
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
He's shut out the communication circuit!
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
Let me.
Go to the water, it's that way!
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
Yorgi and Kirill.
Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.
What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
Aren't you afraid?
They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
Are you alright?
You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
They tell me you're an American agent.
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
What are you?
Go to hell!
I don't know what you're talking about.
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
Who are you?
Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
Mind your business.
Go to hell.
Yorgi asked me to.
So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife.
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
Do you know what a wire transfer is?
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
The Peace conference...
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
What are you doing?
Nothing. He had two days.
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
Love me oodles and oodles?
Still happy you married me?
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
Is it that music?
All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
What?
What in God's name are you doing?
I...
Well... yes.
Hello...?
That's my good boy.
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
Is it worth taking a chance?
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
Oh, darling!  Don't let's spoil everything.
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Why does he call you 'master'?
What a strange fellow.
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
Darling!?!
Love me?
Surprised?
Darling!
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling.
Does that mean you love me?
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
I hope you like large weddings.
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
Will you miss me?
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Promise??
Call me from New York before you leave??
And your passport?
You have your tickets?
Darling!...you will be careful!?
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
I love it when you're excited.  Come then, my Apfelstrudel!  Come into my arms and let me hold you.
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
Are you ready for me?
Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
Yes, I will.
Yes, I know.
Yes, I know.
Why don't we talk inside?
And I have mine.
But, after all, you have yours.
And Elizabeth has hers.
We all have our feelings.  I know that I have mine.  And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.
Nor to Elizabeth.
What?
Of course not.
I know Frederick.
I see what you mean.
Not fooling around.
I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
Good night, Doctor.
I think so.
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Are you serious??
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub-tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal.'
I'd be so nervous.
Me?  Sing?
What are you going to do?
What do you think we should do?
I think you've done it, master.
Oh, Doctor!
It wasn't me.
I thought it was wonderful.
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Right here?
Yes!
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
And look at this, Doctor!
Oh, doctor!
But who was playing it?
Look, Doctor!
Ooh!
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
Are you busy?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Extremely well.
Do Something!  Stall them!
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!

Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
Yes.
Four
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Look how far we've come.
I'm getting tired.
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
His schwanzstucker.
There must have been someone else down here then.
