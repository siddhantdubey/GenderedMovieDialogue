# Gendered Movie Dialogue

This project is the work of Siddhant Dubey and Bhargav Vaduri under the mentorship of Dr. Shashank Srivastava and Dr. Snighda Chaturvedi at UNC Chapel Hill. 

## The Research Problem

What weâ€™re attempting to do with the project is analyze lines from movies and then identify the gender of the character who said the line.
